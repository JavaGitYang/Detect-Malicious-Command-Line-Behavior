       The strdup() function shall return a pointer to a new string, which
       is a duplicate of the string pointed to by s.  The returned pointer
       can be passed to free().  A null pointer is returned if the new
       string cannot be created.
       The strndup() function shall be equivalent to the strdup() function,
       duplicating the provided s in a new block of memory allocated as if
       by using malloc(), with the exception being that strndup() copies at
       most size plus one bytes into the newly allocated memory, terminating
       the new string with a NUL character. If the length of s is larger
       than size, only size bytes shall be duplicated. If size is larger
       than the length of s, all bytes in s shall be copied into the new
       memory buffer, including the terminating NUL character. The newly
       created string shall always be properly terminated.
