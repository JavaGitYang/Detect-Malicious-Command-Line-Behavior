       This program replays a typescript, using timing information to ensure
       that output happens in the same rhythm as it originally appeared when
       the script was recorded.
       The replay simply displays the information again; the programs that
       were run when the typescript was being recorded are not run again.
       Since the same information is simply being displayed, scriptreplay is
       only guaranteed to work properly if run on the same type of terminal
       the typescript was recorded on.  Otherwise, any escape characters in
       the typescript may be interpreted differently by the terminal to
       which scriptreplay is sending its output.
       The timing information is what script(1) outputs to standard error if
       it is run with the -t parameter.
       By default, the typescript to display is assumed to be named
       typescript, but other filenames may be specified, as the second
       parameter or with option -s.
       If the third parameter is specified, it is used as a speed-up
       multiplier.  For example, a speed-up of 2 makes scriptreplay go twice
       as fast, and a speed-up of 0.1 makes it go ten times slower than the
       original session.
