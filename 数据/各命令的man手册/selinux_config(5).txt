       The SELinux config file controls the state of SELinux regarding:
              1.  The policy enforcement status - enforcing, permissive or
                  disabled.
              2.  The policy name or type that forms a path to the policy to
                  be loaded and its supporting configuration files.
              3.  How local users and booleans will be managed when the
                  policy is loaded (note that this function was used by
                  older releases of SELinux and is now deprecated).
              4.  How SELinux-aware login applications should behave if no
                  valid SELinux users are configured.
              5.  Whether the system is to be relabeled or not.
       The entries controlling these functions are described in the FILE
       FORMAT section.
       The fully qualified path name of the SELinux configuration file is
       /etc/selinux/config.
       If the config file is missing or corrupt, then no SELinux policy is
       loaded (i.e. SELinux is disabled).
       The sestatus (8) command and the libselinux function selinux_path (3)
       will return the location of the config file.
