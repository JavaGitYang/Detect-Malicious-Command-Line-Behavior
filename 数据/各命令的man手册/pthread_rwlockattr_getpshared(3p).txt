       The pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value
       of the process-shared attribute from the initialized attributes
       object referenced by attr.  The pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()
       function shall set the process-shared attribute in an initialized
       attributes object referenced by attr.
       The process-shared attribute shall be set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
       to permit a read-write lock to be operated upon by any thread that
       has access to the memory where the read-write lock is allocated, even
       if the read-write lock is allocated in memory that is shared by
       multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the read-write lock shall only be operated
       upon by threads created within the same process as the thread that
       initialized the read-write lock; if threads of differing processes
       attempt to operate on such a read-write lock, the behavior is
       undefined. The default value of the process-shared attribute shall be
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
       associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
       implementation-defined.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_rwlockattr_getpshared() or pthread_rwlockattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized read-write lock attributes object.
