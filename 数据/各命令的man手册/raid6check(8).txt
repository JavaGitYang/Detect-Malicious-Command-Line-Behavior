       RAID6 devices in which one single component drive has errors can use
       the double parity in order to find out which component drive.  The
       "raid6check" tool checks, for each stripe, the double parity
       consistency, reports mismatches and, if possible, which component
       drive has the mismatch.  Since it works at stripe level, it can
       report different drives with mismatches at different stripes.
       "raid6check" requires a non-degraded RAID6 MD device as first
       parameter, a starting stripe (usually 0) and the number of stripes to
       be checked.  If this third parameter is also 0, it will check the
       array up to the end.
       "raid6check" will start printing information about the RAID6, then
       for each stripe, it will report the parity rotation status.  In case
       of parity mismatches, "raid6check" reports, if possible, which
       component drive could be responsible. Otherwise it reports that it is
       not possible to find the component drive.
       If the given MD device is not a RAID6, "raid6check" will, of course,
       not continue.
       If the RAID6 MD device is degraded, "raid6check" will report an error
       and it will not proceed further.
       No write operations are performed on the array or the components.
       Furthermore, the checked array can be online and in use during the
       operation of "raid6check".
