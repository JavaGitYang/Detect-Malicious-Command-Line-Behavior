       These functions provide a conversion between 32-bit long integers and
       little-endian base-64 ASCII strings (of length zero to six).  If the
       string used as argument for a64l() has length greater than six, only
       the first six bytes are used.  If the type long has more than 32
       bits, then l64a() uses only the low order 32 bits of value, and
       a64l() sign-extends its 32-bit result.
       The 64 digits in the base-64 system are:
              '.'  represents a 0
              '/'  represents a 1
              0-9  represent  2-11
              A-Z  represent 12-37
              a-z  represent 38-63
       So 123 = 59*64^0 + 1*64^1 = "v/".
