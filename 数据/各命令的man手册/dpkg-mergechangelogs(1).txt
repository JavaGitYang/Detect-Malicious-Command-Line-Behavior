       This program will use the 3 provided versions of the Debian changelog
       to generate a merged changelog file. The resulting changelog is
       stored in the file out or output to the standard output if that
       parameter is not given.
       Each entry is identified by its version number and they are assumed
       to be not conflicting, they are simply merged in the right order (by
       decreasing version number). When --merge-prereleases is used, the
       part of the version number after the last tilde is dropped so that
       1.0-1~exp1 and 1.0-1~exp5 are considered to be the same entry. When
       the same version is available in both new-a and new-b, a standard
       line-based 3-way merge is attempted (provided that the module
       Algorithm::Merge is available — it's part of the package
       libalgorithm-merge-perl — otherwise you get a global conflict on the
       content of the entry).
