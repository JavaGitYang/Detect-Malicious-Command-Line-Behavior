       lexgrog is an implementation of the traditional “groff guess” utility
       in lex.  It reads the list of files on its command line as either man
       page source files or preformatted “cat” pages, and displays their
       name and description as used by apropos and whatis, the list of
       preprocessing filters required by the man page before it is passed to
       nroff or troff, or both.
       If its input is badly formatted, lexgrog will print “parse failed”;
       this may be useful for external programs that need to check man pages
       for correctness.  If one of lexgrog's input files is “-”, it will
       read from standard input; if any input file is compressed, a
       decompressed version will be read automatically.
