       Fetch branches and/or tags (collectively, "refs") from one or more
       other repositories, along with the objects necessary to complete
       their histories. Remote-tracking branches are updated (see the
       description of <refspec> below for ways to control this behavior).
       By default, any tag that points into the histories being fetched is
       also fetched; the effect is to fetch tags that point at branches that
       you are interested in. This default behavior can be changed by using
       the --tags or --no-tags options or by configuring
       remote.<name>.tagOpt. By using a refspec that fetches tags
       explicitly, you can fetch tags that do not point into branches you
       are interested in as well.
       git fetch can fetch from either a single named repository or URL, or
       from several repositories at once if <group> is given and there is a
       remotes.<group> entry in the configuration file. (See git-config(1)).
       When no remote is specified, by default the origin remote will be
       used, unless thereâ€™s an upstream branch configured for the current
       branch.
       The names of refs that are fetched, together with the object names
       they point at, are written to .git/FETCH_HEAD. This information may
       be used by scripts or other git commands, such as git-pull(1).
