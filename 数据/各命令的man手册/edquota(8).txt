       edquota is a quota editor.  One or more users, groups, or projects
       may be specified on the command line. If a number is given in the
       place of user/group/project name it is treated as an UID/GID/Project
       ID. For each user, group, or project a temporary file is created with
       an ASCII representation of the current disk quotas for that user,
       group, or project and an editor is then invoked on the file.  The
       quotas may then be modified, new quotas added, etc.  Setting a quota
       to zero indicates that no quota should be imposed.
       Block usage and limits are reported and interpreted as multiples of
       kibibyte (1024 bytes) blocks by default. Symbols K, M, G, and T can
       be appended to numeric value to express kibibytes, mebibytes,
       gibibytes, and tebibytes.
       Inode usage and limits are interpreted literally. Symbols k, m, g,
       and t can be appended to numeric value to express multiples of 10^3,
       10^6, 10^9, and 10^12 inodes.
       Users are permitted to exceed their soft limits for a grace period
       that may be specified per filesystem.  Once the grace period has
       expired, the soft limit is enforced as a hard limit.
       The current usage information in the file is for informational
       purposes; only the hard and soft limits can be changed.
       Upon leaving the editor, edquota reads the temporary file and
       modifies the binary quota files to reflect the changes made.
       The editor invoked is vi(1) unless either the EDITOR or the VISUAL
       environment variable specifies otherwise.
       Only the super-user may edit quotas.
