       The sem_getvalue() function shall update the location referenced by
       the sval argument to have the value of the semaphore referenced by
       sem without affecting the state of the semaphore. The updated value
       represents an actual semaphore value that occurred at some
       unspecified time during the call, but it need not be the actual value
       of the semaphore when it is returned to the calling process.
       If sem is locked, then the object to which sval points shall either
       be set to zero or to a negative number whose absolute value
       represents the number of processes waiting for the semaphore at some
       unspecified time during the call.
