       systemd-logind is a system service that manages user logins. It is
       responsible for:
       ·   Keeping track of users and sessions, their processes and their
           idle state. This is implemented by allocating a systemd slice
           unit for each user below user.slice, and a scope unit below it
           for each concurrent session of a user. Also, a per-user service
           manager is started as system service instance of user@.service
           for each user logged in.
       ·   Generating and managing session IDs. If auditing is available and
           an audit session ID is set for a session already, the session ID
           is initialized from it. Otherwise, an independent session counter
           is used.
       ·   Providing PolicyKit-based access for users to operations such as
           system shutdown or sleep
       ·   Implementing a shutdown/sleep inhibition logic for applications
       ·   Handling of power/sleep hardware keys
       ·   Multi-seat management
       ·   Session switch management
       ·   Device access management for users
       ·   Automatic spawning of text logins (gettys) on virtual console
           activation and user runtime directory management
       User sessions are registered with logind via the pam_systemd(8) PAM
       module.
       See logind.conf(5) for information about the configuration of this
       service.
       See Multi-Seat on Linux[1] for an introduction into basic concepts of
       logind such as users, sessions and seats.
       See the logind D-Bus API Documentation[2] for information about the
       APIs systemd-logind provides.
       For more information on the inhibition logic see the Inhibitor Lock
       Developer Documentation[3].
