       The string operand shall be treated as a pathname, as defined in the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.267, Pathname.
       The string string shall be converted to the name of the directory
       containing the filename corresponding to the last pathname component
       in string, performing actions equivalent to the following steps in
       order:
        1. If string is //, skip steps 2 to 5.
        2. If string consists entirely of <slash> characters, string shall
           be set to a single <slash> character. In this case, skip steps 3
           to 8.
        3. If there are any trailing <slash> characters in string, they
           shall be removed.
        4. If there are no <slash> characters remaining in string, string
           shall be set to a single <period> character. In this case, skip
           steps 5 to 8.
        5. If there are any trailing non-<slash> characters in string, they
           shall be removed.
        6. If the remaining string is //, it is implementation-defined
           whether steps 7 and 8 are skipped or processed.
        7. If there are any trailing <slash> characters in string, they
           shall be removed.
        8. If the remaining string is empty, string shall be set to a single
           <slash> character.
       The resulting string shall be written to standard output.
