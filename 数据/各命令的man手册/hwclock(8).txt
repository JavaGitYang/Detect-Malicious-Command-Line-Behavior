       hwclock is an administration tool for the time clocks.  It can:
       display the Hardware Clock time; set the Hardware Clock to a
       specified time; set the Hardware Clock from the System Clock; set the
       System Clock from the Hardware Clock; compensate for Hardware Clock
       drift; correct the System Clock timescale; set the kernel's timezone,
       NTP timescale, and epoch (Alpha only); and predict future Hardware
       Clock values based on its drift rate.
       Since v2.26 important changes were made to the --hctosys function and
       the --directisa option, and a new option --update-drift was added.
       See their respective descriptions below.
