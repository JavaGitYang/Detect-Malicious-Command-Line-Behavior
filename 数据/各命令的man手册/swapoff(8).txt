       swapon is used to specify devices on which paging and swapping are to
       take place.
       The device or file used is given by the specialfile parameter.  It
       may be of the form -L label or -U uuid to indicate a device by label
       or uuid.
       Calls to swapon normally occur in the system boot scripts making all
       swap devices available, so that the paging and swapping activity is
       interleaved across several devices and files.
       swapoff disables swapping on the specified devices and files.  When
       the -a flag is given, swapping is disabled on all known swap devices
       and files (as found in /proc/swaps or /etc/fstab).
