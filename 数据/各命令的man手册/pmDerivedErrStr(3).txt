       When pmRegisterDerived(3) is called to add a new derived metric
       definition and an error occurs, pmDerivedErrStr may be called to
       return the associated error message.
       The pmRegisterDerivedMetric interface provides a convenience wrapper
       around both pmRegisterDerived and pmDerivedErrStr.
