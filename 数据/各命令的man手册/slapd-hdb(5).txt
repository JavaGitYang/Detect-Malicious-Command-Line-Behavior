       The bdb backend to slapd(8) uses the Oracle Berkeley DB (BDB) package
       to store data.  It makes extensive use of indexing and caching to
       speed data access.
       Note that BDB is deprecated and support will be dropped in future
       OpenLDAP releases. Installations should use the mdb backend instead.
       hdb is a variant of the bdb backend that uses a hierarchical database
       layout which supports subtree renames. It is both more space-
       efficient and more execution-efficient than the bdb backend.  It is
       otherwise identical to the bdb behavior, and all the same
       configuration options apply.
       It is noted that these options are intended to complement Berkeley DB
       configuration options set in the environment's DB_CONFIG file.  See
       Berkeley DB documentation for details on DB_CONFIG configuration
       options.  Where there is overlap, settings in DB_CONFIG take
       precedence.
