       lxc-update-config detects any legacy configuration keys in the given
       config file and will replace them with the appropriate new
       configuration keys.
       lxc-update-config will first create a backup of the old config file
       in the same directory and name it config.backup and then update the
       original config file in place. In case the update fails to apply or
       leads to an invalid config file that cannot be used to start a
       container users can either compare config with config.backup and try
       to manually repair any the invalid configuration keys or simply
       rollback to the legacy configuration file by copying config.backup to
       config.
       Any failures for lxc-update-config to generate a useable config file
       are a bug and should be reported upstream.
