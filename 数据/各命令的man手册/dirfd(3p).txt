       The dirfd() function shall return a file descriptor referring to the
       same directory as the dirp argument. This file descriptor shall be
       closed by a call to closedir().  If any attempt is made to close the
       file descriptor, or to modify the state of the associated
       description, other than by means of closedir(), readdir(),
       readdir_r(), rewinddir(), or seekdir(), the behavior is undefined.
