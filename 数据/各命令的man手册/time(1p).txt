       The time utility shall invoke the utility named by the utility
       operand with arguments supplied as the argument operands and write a
       message to standard error that lists timing statistics for the
       utility. The message shall include the following information:
        *  The elapsed (real) time between invocation of utility and its
           termination.
        *  The User CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the tms_utime and
           tms_cutime fields returned by the times() function defined in the
           System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 for the process in which
           utility is executed.
        *  The System CPU time, equivalent to the sum of the tms_stime and
           tms_cstime fields returned by the times() function for the
           process in which utility is executed.
       The precision of the timing shall be no less than the granularity
       defined for the size of the clock tick unit on the system, but the
       results shall be reported in terms of standard time units (for
       example, 0.02 seconds, 00:00:00.02, 1m33.75s, 365.21 seconds), not
       numbers of clock ticks.
       When time is used as part of a pipeline, the times reported are
       unspecified, except when it is the sole command within a grouping
       command (see Section 2.9.4.1, Grouping Commands) in that pipeline.
       For example, the commands on the left are unspecified; those on the
       right report on utilities a and c, respectively:
           time a | b | c    { time a; } | b | c
           a | b | time c    a | b | (time c)
