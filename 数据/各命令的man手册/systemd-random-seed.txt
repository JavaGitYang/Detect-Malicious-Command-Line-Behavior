       systemd-random-seed.service is a service that restores the random
       seed of the system at early boot and saves it at shutdown. See
       random(4) for details. Saving/restoring the random seed across boots
       increases the amount of available entropy early at boot. On disk the
       random seed is stored in /var/lib/systemd/random-seed.
