       Adds a replace reference in refs/replace/ namespace.
       The name of the replace reference is the SHA-1 of the object that is
       replaced. The content of the replace reference is the SHA-1 of the
       replacement object.
       The replaced object and the replacement object must be of the same
       type. This restriction can be bypassed using -f.
       Unless -f is given, the replace reference must not yet exist.
       There is no other restriction on the replaced and replacement
       objects. Merge commits can be replaced by non-merge commits and vice
       versa.
       Replacement references will be used by default by all Git commands
       except those doing reachability traversal (prune, pack transfer and
       fsck).
       It is possible to disable use of replacement references for any
       command using the --no-replace-objects option just after git.
       For example if commit foo has been replaced by commit bar:
           $ git --no-replace-objects cat-file commit foo
       shows information about commit foo, while:
           $ git cat-file commit foo
       shows information about commit bar.
       The GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS environment variable can be set to achieve
       the same effect as the --no-replace-objects option.
