       By default, the uname utility shall write the operating system name
       to standard output. When options are specified, symbols representing
       one or more system characteristics shall be written to the standard
       output. The format and contents of the symbols are implementation-
       defined. On systems conforming to the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, the symbols written shall be those supported by the
       uname() function as defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008.
