       arch_prctl() sets architecture-specific process or thread state.
       code selects a subfunction and passes argument addr to it; addr is
       interpreted as either an unsigned long for the "set" operations, or
       as an unsigned long *, for the "get" operations.
       Subfunctions for x86-64 are:
       ARCH_SET_FS
              Set the 64-bit base for the FS register to addr.
       ARCH_GET_FS
              Return the 64-bit base value for the FS register of the
              current thread in the unsigned long pointed to by addr.
       ARCH_SET_GS
              Set the 64-bit base for the GS register to addr.
       ARCH_GET_GS
              Return the 64-bit base value for the GS register of the
              current thread in the unsigned long pointed to by addr.
