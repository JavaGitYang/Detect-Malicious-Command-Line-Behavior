       pam_systemd registers user sessions with the systemd login manager
       systemd-logind.service(8), and hence the systemd control group
       hierarchy.
       On login, this module — in conjunction with systemd-logind.service —
       ensures the following:
        1. If it does not exist yet, the user runtime directory
           /run/user/$UID is either created or mounted as new "tmpfs" file
           system with quota applied, and its ownership changed to the user
           that is logging in.
        2. The $XDG_SESSION_ID environment variable is initialized. If
           auditing is available and pam_loginuid.so was run before this
           module (which is highly recommended), the variable is initialized
           from the auditing session id (/proc/self/sessionid). Otherwise,
           an independent session counter is used.
        3. A new systemd scope unit is created for the session. If this is
           the first concurrent session of the user, an implicit per-user
           slice unit below user.slice is automatically created and the
           scope placed into it. An instance of the system service
           user@.service, which runs the systemd user manager instance, is
           started.
       On logout, this module ensures the following:
        1. If enabled in logind.conf(5) (KillUserProcesses=), all processes
           of the session are terminated. If the last concurrent session of
           a user ends, the user's systemd instance will be terminated too,
           and so will the user's slice unit.
        2. If the last concurrent session of a user ends, the user runtime
           directory /run/user/$UID and all its contents are removed, too.
       If the system was not booted up with systemd as init system, this
       module does nothing and immediately returns PAM_SUCCESS.
