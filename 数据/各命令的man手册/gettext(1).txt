       The gettext program translates a natural language message into the
       user's language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog.
       Display native language translation of a textual message.
       -d, --domain=TEXTDOMAIN
              retrieve translated messages from TEXTDOMAIN
       -e     enable expansion of some escape sequences
       -E     (ignored for compatibility)
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit
       -n     suppress trailing newline
       -V, --version
              display version information and exit
       [TEXTDOMAIN] MSGID
              retrieve translated message corresponding to MSGID from
              TEXTDOMAIN
       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined
       from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is
       not found in the regular directory, another location can be specified
       with the environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  When used with the -s
       option the program behaves like the 'echo' command.  But it does not
       simply copy its arguments to stdout.  Instead those messages found in
       the selected catalog are translated.  Standard search directory:
       /usr/local/share/locale
