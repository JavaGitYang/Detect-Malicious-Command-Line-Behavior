       getfilecon() retrieves the context associated with the given path in
       the file system, the length of the context is returned.
       lgetfilecon() is identical to getfilecon(), except in the case of a
       symbolic link, where the link itself is interrogated, not the file
       that it refers to.
       fgetfilecon() is identical to getfilecon(), only the open file
       pointed to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) is interrogated in
       place of path.
       getfilecon_raw(), lgetfilecon_raw() and fgetfilecon_raw() behave
       identically to their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context
       translation.
       The returned context should be freed with freecon(3) if non-NULL.
