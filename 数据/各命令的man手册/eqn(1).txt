       This manual page describes the GNU version of eqn, which is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  eqn compiles descriptions of
       equations embedded within troff input files into commands that are
       understood by troff.  Normally, it should be invoked using the -e
       option of groff.  The syntax is quite compatible with Unix eqn.  The
       output of GNU eqn cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must be
       processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line,
       the standard input is read.  A filename of - causes the standard
       input to be read.
       eqn searches for the file eqnrc in the directories given with the -M
       option first, then in /usr/local/lib/groff/site-tmac,
       /usr/local/share/groff/site-tmac, and finally in the standard macro
       directory /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac.  If it exists, eqn
       processes it before the other input files.  The -R option prevents
       this.
       GNU eqn does not provide the functionality of neqn: it does not
       support low-resolution, typewriter-like devices (although it may work
       adequately for very simple input).
