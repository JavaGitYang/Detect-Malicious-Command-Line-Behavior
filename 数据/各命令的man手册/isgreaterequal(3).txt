       The normal relational operations (like <, "less than") fail if one of
       the operands is NaN.  This will cause an exception.  To avoid this,
       C99 defines the macros listed below.
       These macros are guaranteed to evaluate their arguments only once.
       The arguments must be of real floating-point type (note: do not pass
       integer values as arguments to these macros, since the arguments will
       not be promoted to real-floating types).
       isgreater()
              determines (x) > (y) without an exception if x or y is NaN.
       isgreaterequal()
              determines (x) >= (y) without an exception if x or y is NaN.
       isless()
              determines (x) < (y) without an exception if x or y is NaN.
       islessequal()
              determines (x) <= (y) without an exception if x or y is NaN.
       islessgreater()
              determines (x) < (y) || (x) > (y) without an exception if x or
              y is NaN.  This macro is not equivalent to x != y because that
              expression is true if x or y is NaN.
       isunordered()
              determines whether its arguments are unordered, that is,
              whether at least one of the arguments is a NaN.
