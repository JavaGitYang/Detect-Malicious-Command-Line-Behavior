       Valgrind is a flexible program for debugging and profiling Linux
       executables. It consists of a core, which provides a synthetic CPU in
       software, and a series of debugging and profiling tools. The
       architecture is modular, so that new tools can be created easily and
       without disturbing the existing structure.
       Some of the options described below work with all Valgrind tools, and
       some only work with a few or one. The section MEMCHECK OPTIONS and
       those below it describe tool-specific options.
       This manual page covers only basic usage and options. For more
       comprehensive information, please see the HTML documentation on your
       system: $INSTALL/share/doc/valgrind/html/index.html, or online:
