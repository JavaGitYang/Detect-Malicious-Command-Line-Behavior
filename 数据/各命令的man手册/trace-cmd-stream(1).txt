       The trace-cmd(1) stream will start tracing just like
       trace-cmd-record(1), except it will not record to a file and instead
       it will read the binary buffer as it is happening, convert it to a
       human readable format and write it to stdout.
       This is basically the same as trace-cmd-start(1) and then doing a
       trace-cmd-show(1) with the -p option. trace-cmd-stream is not as
       efficient as reading from the pipe file as most of the stream work is
       done in userspace. This is useful if it is needed to do the work
       mostly in userspace instead of the kernel, and stream also helps to
       debug trace-cmd-profile(1) which uses the stream code to perform the
       live data analysis for the profile.
