       The pthread_setconcurrency() function informs the implementation of
       the application's desired concurrency level, specified in new_level.
       The implementation takes this only as a hint: POSIX.1 does not
       specify the level of concurrency that should be provided as a result
       of calling pthread_setconcurrency().
       Specifying new_level as 0 instructs the implementation to manage the
       concurrency level as it deems appropriate.
       pthread_getconcurrency() returns the current value of the concurrency
       level for this process.
