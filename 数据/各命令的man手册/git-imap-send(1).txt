       This command uploads a mailbox generated with git format-patch into
       an IMAP drafts folder. This allows patches to be sent as other email
       is when using mail clients that cannot read mailbox files directly.
       The command also works with any general mailbox in which emails have
       the fields "From", "Date", and "Subject" in that order.
       Typical usage is something like:
       git format-patch --signoff --stdout --attach origin | git imap-send
