       The readdir() function returns a pointer to a dirent structure
       representing the next directory entry in the directory stream pointed
       to by dirp.  It returns NULL on reaching the end of the directory
       stream or if an error occurred.
       In the glibc implementation, the dirent structure is defined as
       follows:
           struct dirent {
               ino_t          d_ino;       /* Inode number */
               off_t          d_off;       /* Not an offset; see below */
               unsigned short d_reclen;    /* Length of this record */
               unsigned char  d_type;      /* Type of file; not supported
                                              by all filesystem types */
               char           d_name[256]; /* Null-terminated filename */
           };
       The only fields in the dirent structure that are mandated by POSIX.1
       are d_name and d_ino.  The other fields are unstandardized, and not
       present on all systems; see NOTES below for some further details.
       The fields of the dirent structure are as follows:
       d_ino  This is the inode number of the file.
       d_off  The value returned in d_off is the same as would be returned
              by calling telldir(3) at the current position in the directory
              stream.  Be aware that despite its type and name, the d_off
              field is seldom any kind of directory offset on modern
              filesystems.  Applications should treat this field as an
              opaque value, making no assumptions about its contents; see
              also telldir(3).
       d_reclen
              This is the size (in bytes) of the returned record.  This may
              not match the size of the structure definition shown above;
              see NOTES.
       d_type This field contains a value indicating the file type, making
              it possible to avoid the expense of calling lstat(2) if fur‚Äê
              ther actions depend on the type of the file.
              When a suitable feature test macro is defined (_DEFAULT_SOURCE
              on glibc versions since 2.19, or _BSD_SOURCE on glibc versions
              2.19 and earlier), glibc defines the following macro constants
              for the value returned in d_type:
              DT_BLK      This is a block device.
              DT_CHR      This is a character device.
              DT_DIR      This is a directory.
              DT_FIFO     This is a named pipe (FIFO).
              DT_LNK      This is a symbolic link.
              DT_REG      This is a regular file.
              DT_SOCK     This is a UNIX domain socket.
              DT_UNKNOWN  The file type could not be determined.
              Currently, only some filesystems (among them: Btrfs, ext2,
              ext3, and ext4) have full support for returning the file type
              in d_type.  All applications must properly handle a return of
              DT_UNKNOWN.
       d_name This field contains the null terminated filename.  See NOTES.
       The data returned by readdir() may be overwritten by subsequent calls
       to readdir() for the same directory stream.
