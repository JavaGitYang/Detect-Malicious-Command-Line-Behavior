       The feraiseexcept() function shall attempt to raise the supported
       floating-point exceptions represented by the argument excepts.  The
       order in which these floating-point exceptions are raised is
       unspecified. Whether the feraiseexcept() function additionally raises
       the inexact floating-point exception whenever it raises the overflow
       or underflow floating-point exception is implementation-defined.
