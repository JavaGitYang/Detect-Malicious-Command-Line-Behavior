       The aio_cancel() function attempts to cancel outstanding asynchronous
       I/O requests for the file descriptor fd.  If aiocbp is NULL, all such
       requests are canceled.  Otherwise, only the request described by the
       control block pointed to by aiocbp is canceled.  (See aio(7) for a
       description of the aiocb structure.)
       Normal asynchronous notification occurs for canceled requests (see
       aio(7) and sigevent(7)).  The request return status (aio_return(3))
       is set to -1, and the request error status (aio_error(3)) is set to
       ECANCELED.  The control block of requests that cannot be canceled is
       not changed.
       If the request could not be canceled, then it will terminate in the
       usual way after performing the I/O operation.  (In this case,
       aio_error(3) will return the status EINPROGRESSS.)
       If aiocbp is not NULL, and fd differs from the file descriptor with
       which the asynchronous operation was initiated, unspecified results
       occur.
       Which operations are cancelable is implementation-defined.
