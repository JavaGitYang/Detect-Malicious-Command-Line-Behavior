       This manual page describes the checkpolicy command.
       checkpolicy is a program that checks and compiles a SELinux security
       policy configuration into a binary representation that can be loaded
       into the kernel.  If no input file name is specified, checkpolicy
       will attempt to read from policy.conf or policy, depending on whether
       the -b flag is specified.
