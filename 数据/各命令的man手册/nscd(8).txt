       nscd is a daemon that provides a cache for the most common name
       service requests.  The default configuration file, /etc/nscd.conf,
       determines the behavior of the cache daemon.  See nscd.conf(5).
       nscd provides caching for accesses of the passwd(5), group(5),
       hosts(5) services(5) and netgroup databases through standard libc
       interfaces, such as getpwnam(3), getpwuid(3), getgrnam(3),
       getgrgid(3), gethostbyname(3), and others.
       There are two caches for each database: a positive one for items
       found, and a negative one for items not found.  Each cache has a
       separate TTL (time-to-live) period for its data.  Note that the
       shadow file is specifically not cached.  getspnam(3) calls remain
       uncached as a result.
