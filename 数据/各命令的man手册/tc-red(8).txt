       Random Early Detection is a classless qdisc which manages its queue
       size smartly. Regular queues simply drop packets from the tail when
       they are full, which may not be the optimal behaviour. RED also
       performs tail drop, but does so in a more gradual way.
       Once the queue hits a certain average length, packets enqueued have a
       configurable chance of being marked (which may mean dropped). This
       chance increases linearly up to a point called the max average queue
       length, although the queue might get bigger.
       This has a host of benefits over simple taildrop, while not being
       processor intensive. It prevents synchronous retransmits after a
       burst in traffic, which cause further retransmits, etc.
       The goal is to have a small queue size, which is good for
       interactivity while not disturbing TCP/IP traffic with too many
       sudden drops after a burst of traffic.
       Depending on if ECN is configured, marking either means dropping or
       purely marking a packet as overlimit.
