       catman is used to create an up to date set of pre-formatted manual
       pages known as cat pages.  Cat pages are generally much faster to
       display than the original manual pages, but require extra storage
       space.  The decision to support cat pages is that of the local
       administrator, who must provide suitable directories to contain them.
       The options available to catman are the manual page hierarchies and
       sections to pre-format.  The default hierarchies are those specified
       as system hierarchies in the man-db configuration file, and the
       default sections are either the colon-delimited contents of the
       environment variable $MANSECT or the standard set compiled into man
       if $MANSECT is undefined.  Supplying catman with a set of whitespace-
       delimited section names will override both of the above.
       catman makes use of the index database cache associated with each
       hierarchy to determine which files need to be formatted.
