       pmdaDaemon initializes the pmdaInterface structure to use the
       interface extensions assuming the PMDA(3) is to be run as a daemon.
       The pmdaInterface structure is initialized with:
       name           The name of the agent.
       domain         The default domain number of the agent which uniquely
                      identifies this PMDA from other running PMDAs.  This
                      may be subsequently changed by a command line option
                      -d (see pmdaGetOpt(3)).
       logfile        The default path to the log file.  This may be
                      replaced by the -l command line option if using
                      pmdaGetOpt.  logfile will be copied with strdup(3), so
                      the storage associated with logfile may be released
                      after the call to pmdaDaemon.
       helptext       The default path to the help text (see pmdaText(3).
                      This may be replaced by the -h command line option if
                      using pmdaGetOpt(3).  If no help text is installed, or
                      you are not using pmdaText(3), then this should be set
                      to NULL, otherwise helptext will be copied with
                      strdup(3), so the storage associated with helptext may
                      be released after the call to pmdaDaemon.
       The callbacks are initialized to pmdaProfile(3), pmdaFetch(3),
       pmdaDesc(3), pmdaText(3), pmdaInstance(3) and pmdaStore(3).
