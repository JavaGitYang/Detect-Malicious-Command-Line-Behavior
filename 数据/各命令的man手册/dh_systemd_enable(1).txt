       dh_systemd_enable is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       enabling and disabling systemd unit files.
       In the simple case, it finds all unit files installed by a package
       (e.g.  bacula-fd.service) and enables them. It is not necessary that
       the machine actually runs systemd during package installation time,
       enabling happens on all machines in order to be able to switch from
       sysvinit to systemd and back.
       In the complex case, you can call dh_systemd_enable and
       dh_systemd_start manually (by overwriting the debian/rules targets)
       and specify flags per unit file. An example is colord, which ships
       colord.service, a dbus-activated service without an [Install]
       section. This service file cannot be enabled or disabled (a state
       called "static" by systemd) because it has no [Install] section.
       Therefore, running dh_systemd_enable does not make sense.
       For only generating blocks for specific service files, you need to
       pass them as arguments, e.g. dh_systemd_enable quota.service and
       dh_systemd_enable --name=quotarpc quotarpc.service.
