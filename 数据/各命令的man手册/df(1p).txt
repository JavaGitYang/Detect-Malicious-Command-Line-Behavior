       The df utility shall write the amount of available space and file
       slots for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate
       read access. File systems shall be specified by the file operands;
       when none are specified, information shall be written for all file
       systems. The format of the default output from df is unspecified, but
       all space figures are reported in 512-byte units, unless the −k
       option is specified. This output shall contain at least the file
       system names, amount of available space on each of these file
       systems, and, if no options other than −t are specified, the number
       of free file slots, or inodes, available; when −t is specified, the
       output shall contain the total allocated space as well.
