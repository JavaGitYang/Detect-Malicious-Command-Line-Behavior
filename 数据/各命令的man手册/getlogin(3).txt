       getlogin() returns a pointer to a string containing the name of the
       user logged in on the controlling terminal of the process, or a null
       pointer if this information cannot be determined.  The string is
       statically allocated and might be overwritten on subsequent calls to
       this function or to cuserid().
       getlogin_r() returns this same username in the array buf of size
       bufsize.
       cuserid() returns a pointer to a string containing a username
       associated with the effective user ID of the process.  If string is
       not a null pointer, it should be an array that can hold at least
       L_cuserid characters; the string is returned in this array.
       Otherwise, a pointer to a string in a static area is returned.  This
       string is statically allocated and might be overwritten on subsequent
       calls to this function or to getlogin().
       The macro L_cuserid is an integer constant that indicates how long an
       array you might need to store a username.  L_cuserid is declared in
       <stdio.h>.
       These functions let your program identify positively the user who is
       running (cuserid()) or the user who logged in this session
       (getlogin()).  (These can differ when set-user-ID programs are
       involved.)
       For most purposes, it is more useful to use the environment variable
       LOGNAME to find out who the user is.  This is more flexible precisely
       because the user can set LOGNAME arbitrarily.
