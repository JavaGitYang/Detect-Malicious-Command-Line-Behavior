       The sa2 command is a shell procedure variant of the sar command which
       writes a daily report in the sarDD or the sarYYYYMMDD file, where
       YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for
       the current day.  By default the report is saved in the /var/log/sa
       directory.  The sa2 command will also remove reports more than one
       week old by default.  You can however keep reports for a longer (or a
       shorter) period by setting the HISTORY environment variable. Read the
       sysstat(5) manual page for details.
       The sa2 command accepts most of the flags and parameters of the sar
       command.
       The sa2 command is designed to be started automatically by the cron
       command.
