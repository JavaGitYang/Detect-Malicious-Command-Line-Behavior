       The seccomp_init() and seccomp_reset() functions (re)initialize the
       internal seccomp filter state, prepares it for use, and sets the
       default action based on the def_action parameter.  The seccomp_init()
       function must be called before any other libseccomp functions as the
       rest of the library API will fail if the filter context is not
       initialized properly.  The seccomp_reset() function releases the
       existing filter context state before reinitializing it and can only
       be called after a call to seccomp_init() has succeeded.
       When the caller is finished configuring the seccomp filter and has
       loaded it into the kernel, the caller should call seccomp_release(3)
       to release all of the filter context state.
       Valid def_action values are as follows:
       SCMP_ACT_KILL
              The thread will be terminated by the kernel with SIGSYS when
              it calls a syscall that does not match any of the configured
              seccomp filter rules.  The thread will not be able to catch
              the signal.
       SCMP_ACT_TRAP
              The thread will be sent a SIGSYS signal when it calls a
              syscall that does not match any of the configured seccomp
              filter rules.  It may catch this and change its behavior
              accordingly.  When using SA_SIGINFO with sigaction(2), si_code
              will be set to SYS_SECCOMP, si_syscall will be set to the
              syscall that failed the rules, and si_arch will be set to the
              AUDIT_ARCH for the active ABI.
       SCMP_ACT_ERRNO(uint16_t errno)
              The thread will receive a return value of errno when it calls
              a syscall that does not match any of the configured seccomp
              filter rules.
       SCMP_ACT_TRACE(uint16_t msg_num)
              If the thread is being traced and the tracing process
              specified the PTRACE_O_TRACESECCOMP option in the call to
              ptrace(2), the tracing process will be notified, via
              PTRACE_EVENT_SECCOMP, and the value provided in msg_num can be
              retrieved using the PTRACE_GETEVENTMSG option.
       SCMP_ACT_LOG
              The seccomp filter will have no effect on the thread calling
              the syscall if it does not match any of the configured seccomp
              filter rules but the syscall will be logged.
       SCMP_ACT_ALLOW
              The seccomp filter will have no effect on the thread calling
              the syscall if it does not match any of the configured seccomp
              filter rules.
