       The border_set and wborder_set functions draw a border around the
       edges of the current or specified window.  These functions do not
       change the cursor position, and do not wrap.
       Other than the window, each argument is a complex character with
       attributes:
              ls - left side,
              rs - right side,
              ts - top side,
              bs - bottom side,
              tl - top left-hand corner,
              tr - top right-hand corner,
              bl - bottom left-hand corner, and
              br - bottom right-hand corner.
       If any of these arguments is zero, then the corresponding default
       values (defined in curses.h) are used instead:
              WACS_VLINE,
              WACS_VLINE,
              WACS_HLINE,
              WACS_HLINE,
              WACS_ULCORNER,
              WACS_URCORNER,
              WACS_LLCORNER, and
              WACS_LRCORNER.
       box_set(win, verch, horch); is a shorthand for the following call:
       wborder_set(win, verch, verch,
           horch, horch, NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
       The *line_set functions use wch to draw a line starting at the
       current cursor position in the window.  The line is at most n
       characters long or as many as fit into the window.  The current
       cursor position is not changed.
       The hline_set, mvhline_set, mvwhline_set, and whline_set functions
       draw a line proceeding toward the last column of the same line.
       The vline_set, mvvline_set, mvwvline_set, and wvline_set functions
       draw a line proceeding toward the last line of the window.
