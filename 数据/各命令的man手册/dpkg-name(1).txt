       This manual page documents the dpkg-name program which provides an
       easy way to rename Debian packages into their full package names. A
       full package name consists of package_version_architecture.package-
       type as specified in the control file of the package. The version
       part of the filename consists of the upstream version information
       optionally followed by a hyphen and the revision information. The
       package-type part comes from that field if present or fallbacks to
       deb.
