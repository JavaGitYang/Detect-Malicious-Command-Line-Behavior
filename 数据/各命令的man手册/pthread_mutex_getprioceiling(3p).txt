       The pthread_mutex_getprioceiling() function shall return the current
       priority ceiling of the mutex.
       The pthread_mutex_setprioceiling() function shall attempt to lock the
       mutex as if by a call to pthread_mutex_lock(), except that the
       process of locking the mutex need not adhere to the priority protect
       protocol. On acquiring the mutex it shall change the mutex's priority
       ceiling and then release the mutex as if by a call to
       pthread_mutex_unlock().  When the change is successful, the previous
       value of the priority ceiling shall be returned in old_ceiling.
       If the pthread_mutex_setprioceiling() function fails, the mutex
       priority ceiling shall not be changed.
