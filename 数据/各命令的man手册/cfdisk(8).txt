       cfdisk is a curses-based program for partitioning any block device.
       The default device is /dev/sda.
       Note that cfdisk provides basic partitioning functionality with a
       user-friendly interface.  If you need advanced features, use fdisk(8)
       instead.
       Since version 2.25 cfdisk supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI disk
       labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS (Cylinder-
       Head-Sector) addressing.  CHS has never been important for Linux, and
       this addressing concept does not make any sense for new devices.
       Since version 2.25 cfdisk also does not provide a 'print' command any
       more.  This functionality is provided by the utilities partx(8) and
       lsblk(8) in a very comfortable and rich way.
       If you want to remove an old partition table from a device, use
       wipefs(8).
