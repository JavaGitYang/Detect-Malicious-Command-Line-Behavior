       For an overview of the inotify API, see inotify(7).
       inotify_init() initializes a new inotify instance and returns a file
       descriptor associated with a new inotify event queue.
       If flags is 0, then inotify_init1() is the same as inotify_init().
       The following values can be bitwise ORed in flags to obtain different
       behavior:
       IN_NONBLOCK Set the O_NONBLOCK file status flag on the new open file
                   description.  Using this flag saves extra calls to
                   fcntl(2) to achieve the same result.
       IN_CLOEXEC  Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file
                   descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
                   open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.
