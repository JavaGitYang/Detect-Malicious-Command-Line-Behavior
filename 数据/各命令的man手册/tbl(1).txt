       This manual page describes the GNU version of tbl, which is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  tbl compiles descriptions of
       tables embedded within troff input files into commands that are
       understood by troff.  Normally, it should be invoked using the -t
       option of groff.  It is highly compatible with Unix tbl.  The output
       generated by GNU tbl cannot be processed with Unix troff; it must be
       processed with GNU troff.  If no files are given on the command line
       or a filename of - is given, the standard input is read.
