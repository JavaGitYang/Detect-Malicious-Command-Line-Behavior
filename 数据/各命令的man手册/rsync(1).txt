       Rsync is a fast and extraordinarily versatile file copying tool.  It
       can copy locally, to/from another host over any remote shell, or
       to/from a remote rsync daemon.  It offers a large number of options
       that control every aspect of its behavior and permit very flexible
       specification of the set of files to be copied.  It is famous for its
       delta-transfer algorithm, which reduces the amount of data sent over
       the network by sending only the differences between the source files
       and the existing files in the destination.  Rsync is widely used for
       backups and mirroring and as an improved copy command for everyday
       use.
       Rsync finds files that need to be transferred using a "quick check"
       algorithm (by default) that looks for files that have changed in size
       or in last-modified time.  Any changes in the other preserved
       attributes (as requested by options) are made on the destination file
       directly when the quick check indicates that the fileâ€™s data does not
       need to be updated.
       Some of the additional features of rsync are:
       o      support for copying links, devices, owners, groups, and
              permissions
       o      exclude and exclude-from options similar to GNU tar
       o      a CVS exclude mode for ignoring the same files that CVS would
              ignore
       o      can use any transparent remote shell, including ssh or rsh
       o      does not require super-user privileges
       o      pipelining of file transfers to minimize latency costs
       o      support for anonymous or authenticated rsync daemons (ideal
              for mirroring)
