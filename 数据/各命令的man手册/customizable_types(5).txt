       The customizable_types file contains a list of types that can be
       customised in some way by SELinux-aware applications.
       Generally this is a file context type that is usually set on files
       that need to be shared among certain domains and where the
       administrator wants to manually manage the type.
       The  use  of customizable types is deprecated as the preferred
       approach is to use semanage(8) fcontext(8) ...(8).  However, SELinux-
       aware applications such as setfiles(8) will use this information to
       obtain a list of types relating to files that should not be
       relabeled.
       selinux_customizable_types_path(3) will return the active policy path
       to this file. The default customizable types file is:
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/customizable_types
       Where {SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux configuration file
       config (see selinux_config(5)).
       is_context_customizable(3) reads this file to determine if a context
       is customisable or not for the active policy.
