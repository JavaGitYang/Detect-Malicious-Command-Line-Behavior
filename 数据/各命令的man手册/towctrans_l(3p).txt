       For towctrans(): The functionality described on this reference page
       is aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The towctrans() and towctrans_l() functions shall transliterate the
       wide-character code wc using the mapping described by desc.
       The current setting of the LC_CTYPE category in the current locale or
       in the locale represented by locale, respectively, should be the same
       as during the call to wctrans() or wctrans_l() that returned the
       value desc.
       If the value of desc is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to
       wctrans() or desc is invalidated by a subsequent call to setlocale()
       that has affected category LC_CTYPE), the result is unspecified.
       If the value of desc is invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to
       wctrans_l() with the same locale object locale) the result is
       unspecified.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to 0 before calling towctrans() or towctrans_l().
       If errno is non-zero on return, an error has occurred.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to towctrans_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
