       pmdacifs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values about mounted CIFS shares from the /proc/fs/cifs
       directory. This PMDA requires at least the CIFS kernel module to be
       loaded to return some metric values and at least one mounted CIFS
       share in order to provide data for all metrics.
       Further details on CIFS can be found at http://redhat.com
