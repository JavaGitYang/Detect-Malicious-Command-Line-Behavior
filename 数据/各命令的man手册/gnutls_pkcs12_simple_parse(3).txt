       This function parses a PKCS12 structure in  pkcs12 and extracts the
       private key, the corresponding certificate chain, any additional
       certificates and a CRL. The structures in  key ,  chain  crl , and
       extra_certs must not be initialized.
       The  extra_certs and  extra_certs_len parameters are optional and
       both may be set to NULL. If either is non-NULL, then both must be
       set. The value for  extra_certs is allocated using gnutls_malloc().
       Encrypted PKCS12 bags and PKCS8 private keys are supported, but only
       with password based security and the same password for all
       operations.
       Note that a PKCS12 structure may contain many keys and/or
       certificates, and there is no way to identify which key/certificate
       pair you want.  For this reason this function is useful for PKCS12
       files that contain only one key/certificate pair and/or one CRL.
       If the provided structure has encrypted fields but no password is
       provided then this function returns GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED.
       Note that normally the chain constructed does not include self signed
       certificates, to comply with TLS' requirements. If, however, the flag
       GNUTLS_PKCS12_SP_INCLUDE_SELF_SIGNED is specified then self signed
       certificates will be included in the chain.
       Prior to using this function the PKCS 12 structure integrity must be
       verified using gnutls_pkcs12_verify_mac().
