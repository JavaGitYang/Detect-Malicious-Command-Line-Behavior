       lxc-execute runs the specified command inside the container specified
       by name.
       It will setup the container according to the configuration previously
       defined with the lxc-create command or with the configuration file
       parameter.  If no configuration is defined, the default isolation is
       used.
       This command is mainly used when you want to quickly launch an
       application in an isolated environment.
       lxc-execute command will run the specified command into the container
       via an intermediate process, lxc-init.  This lxc-init after launching
       the specified command, will wait for its end and all other reparented
       processes.  (to support daemons in the container).  In other words,
       in the container, lxc-init has the pid 1 and the first process of the
       application has the pid 2.
       The above lxc-init is designed to forward received signals to the
       started command.
