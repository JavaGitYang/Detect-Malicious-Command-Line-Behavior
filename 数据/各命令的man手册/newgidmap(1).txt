       The newgidmap sets /proc/[pid]/gid_map based on its command line
       arguments and the gids allowed in /etc/subgid. Note that the root
       user is not exempted from the requirement for a valid /etc/subgid
       entry.
       After the pid argument, newgidmap expects sets of 3 integers:
       gid
           Beginning of the range of GIDs inside the user namespace.
       lowergid
           Beginning of the range of GIDs outside the user namespace.
       count
           Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
           namespace).
       newgidmap verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
       indicated by pid and that for each of the above sets, each of the
       GIDs in the range [lowergid, lowergid+count] is allowed to the caller
       according to /etc/subgid before setting /proc/[pid]/gid_map.
       Note that newgidmap may be used only once for a given process.
