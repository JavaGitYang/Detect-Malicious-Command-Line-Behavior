       This manual page gives a brief introduction to SMTP mail addresses,
       as used on the Internet.  These addresses are in the general format
            user@domain
       where a domain is a hierarchical dot-separated list of subdomains.
       These examples are valid forms of the same address:
            john.doe@monet.example.com
            John Doe <john.doe@monet.example.com>
            john.doe@monet.example.com (John Doe)
       The domain part ("monet.example.com") is a mail-accepting domain.  It
       can be a host and in the past it usually was, but it doesn't have to
       be.  The domain part is not case sensitive.
       The local part ("john.doe") is often a username, but its meaning is
       defined by the local software.  Sometimes it is case sensitive,
       although that is unusual.  If you see a local-part that looks like
       garbage, it is usually because of a gateway between an internal e-
       mail system and the net, here are some examples:
            "surname/admd=telemail/c=us/o=hp/prmd=hp"@some.where
            USER%SOMETHING@some.where
            machine!machine!name@some.where
            I2461572@some.where
       (These are, respectively, an X.400 gateway, a gateway to an arbitrary
       internal mail system that lacks proper internet support, an UUCP
       gateway, and the last one is just boring username policy.)
       The real-name part ("John Doe") can either be placed before <>, or in
       () at the end.  (Strictly speaking the two aren't the same, but the
       difference is beyond the scope of this page.)  The name may have to
       be quoted using "", for example, if it contains ".":
            "John Q. Doe" <john.doe@monet.example.com>
   Abbreviation
       Some mail systems let users abbreviate the domain name.  For
       instance, users at example.com may get away with "john.doe@monet" to
       send mail to John Doe.  This behavior is deprecated.  Sometimes it
       works, but you should not depend on it.
   Route-addrs
       In the past, sometimes one had to route a message through several
       hosts to get it to its final destination.  Addresses which show these
       relays are termed "route-addrs".  These use the syntax:
            <@hosta,@hostb:user@hostc>
       This specifies that the message should be sent to hosta, from there
       to hostb, and finally to hostc.  Many hosts disregard route-addrs and
       send directly to hostc.
       Route-addrs are very unusual now.  They occur sometimes in old mail
       archives.  It is generally possible to ignore all but the
       "user@hostc" part of the address to determine the actual address.
   Postmaster
       Every site is required to have a user or user alias designated
       "postmaster" to which problems with the mail system may be addressed.
       The "postmaster" address is not case sensitive.
