       Lesskey is used to specify a set of key bindings to be used by less.
       The input file is a text file which describes the key bindings.  If
       the input file is "-", standard input is read.  If no input file is
       specified, a standard filename is used as the name of the input file,
       which depends on the system being used: On Unix systems,
       $HOME/.lesskey is used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_lesskey is used;
       and on OS/2 systems $HOME/lesskey.ini is used, or $INIT/lesskey.ini
       if $HOME is undefined.  The output file is a binary file which is
       used by less.  If no output file is specified, and the environment
       variable LESSKEY is set, the value of LESSKEY is used as the name of
       the output file.  Otherwise, a standard filename is used as the name
       of the output file, which depends on the system being used: On Unix
       and OS-9 systems, $HOME/.less is used; on MS-DOS systems, $HOME/_less
       is used; and on OS/2 systems, $HOME/less.ini is used, or
       $INIT/less.ini if $HOME is undefined.  If the output file already
       exists, lesskey will overwrite it.
       The -V or --version option causes lesskey to print its version number
       and immediately exit.  If -V or --version is present, other options
       and arguments are ignored.
       The input file consists of one or more sections.  Each section starts
       with a line that identifies the type of section.  Possible sections
       are:
       #command
              Defines new command keys.
       #line-edit
              Defines new line-editing keys.
       #env   Defines environment variables.
       Blank lines and lines which start with a pound sign (#) are ignored,
       except for the special section header lines.
