       chem produces chemical structure diagrams.  Today's version is best
       suited for organic chemistry (bonds, rings).  The chem program is a
       groff preprocessor like eqn, pic, tbl, etc.  It generates pic output
       such that all chem parts are translated into diagrams of the pic
       language.
       The program chem originates from the Perl source file chem.pl.  It
       tells pic to include a copy of the macro file chem.pic.  Moreover the
       groff source file pic.tmac is loaded.
       In a style reminiscent of eqn and pic, the chem diagrams are written
       in a special language.
       A set of chem lines looks like this
              .cstart
              chem data
              .cend
       Lines containing the keywords .cstart and .cend start and end the
       input for chem, respectively.  In pic context, i.e., after the call
       of .PS, chem input can optionally be started by the line begin chem
       and ended by the line with the single word end instead.
       Anything outside these initialization lines is copied through without
       modification; all data between the initialization lines is converted
       into pic commands to draw the diagram.
       As an example,
              .cstart
              CH3
              bond
              CH3
              .cend
       prints two CH3 groups with a bond between them.
       To actually view this, you must run chem followed by groffer:
              chem [file ...] | groffer
       If you want to create just groff output, you must run chem followed
       by groff with the option -p for the activation of pic:
              chem [file ...] | groff -p ...
