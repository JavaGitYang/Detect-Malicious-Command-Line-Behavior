       This module performs the standard network authentication for
       services, as used by traditional implementations of rlogin and rsh
       etc.
       The authentication mechanism of this module is based on the contents
       of two files; /etc/hosts.equiv (or and ~/.rhosts. Firstly, hosts
       listed in the former file are treated as equivalent to the localhost.
       Secondly, entries in the user's own copy of the latter file is used
       to map "remote-host remote-user" pairs to that user's account on the
       current host. Access is granted to the user if their host is present
       in /etc/hosts.equiv and their remote account is identical to their
       local one, or if their remote account has an entry in their personal
       configuration file.
       The module authenticates a remote user (internally specified by the
       item PAM_RUSER connecting from the remote host (internally specified
       by the item PAM_RHOST). Accordingly, for applications to be
       compatible this authentication module they must set these items prior
       to calling pam_authenticate(). The module is not capable of
       independently probing the network connection for such information.
