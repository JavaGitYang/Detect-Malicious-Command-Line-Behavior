       The seccomp_export_bpf() and seccomp_export_pfc() functions generate
       and output the current seccomp filter in either BPF (Berkley Packet
       Filter) or PFC (Pseudo Filter Code).  The output of
       seccomp_export_bpf() is suitable for loading into the kernel, while
       the output of seccomp_export_pfc() is human readable and is intended
       primarily as a debugging tool for developers using libseccomp.  Both
       functions write the filter to the fd file descriptor.
       The filter context ctx is the value returned by the call to
       seccomp_init(3).
       While the two output formats are guaranteed to be functionally
       equivalent for the given seccomp filter configuration, the filter
       instructions, and their ordering, are not guaranteed to be the same
       in both the BPF and PFC formats.
