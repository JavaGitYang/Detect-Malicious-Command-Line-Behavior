       Given a PCP service name, as identified by service, and using the
       type of discovery optionally specified in mechanism,
       pmDiscoverServices returns, via urls, a list of URLs representing the
       services discovered on the network.
       The internal function __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions performs the
       same function and adds arguments for global options and a mechanism
       for interrupting the discovery process.
       The pmfind(1) utility provides command line access to both of these
       interfaces.
       Calling
       pmDiscoverServices(service, mechanism, urls)
       is equivalent to calling
       __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions(service, mechanism, NULL, NULL,
       urls);
       service specifies the PCP service to be discovered.  Currently
       supported services are PM_SERVER_SERVICE_SPEC, PM_PROXY_SERVICE_SPEC
       and PM_WEBD_SERVICE_SPEC, which search for pmcd(1), pmproxy(1), and
       pmwebd(1), servers respectively.
       mechanism specifies the style of discovery to be used.
       The currently supported mechanisms are:
       avahi  This searches for services which are broadcasting using mDNS
              via avahi-daemon(8).  An optional suffix ",timeout=N" may be
              added to specify the discovery timeout in floating-point
              multiples of one second.  The default timeout is 0.5 seconds,
              which may be overridden by the AVAHI_DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT
              environment variable, also specified in floating-point
              multiples of one second.  If both are specified, then the
              value specified in the environment variable takes precedence.
       probe=<net-address>/<mask-bits>
              Actively probes the given subnet for the requested PCP
              service(s).  <net-address> is an inet or ipv6 network address
              and <mask-bits> is the number of bits used to define the
              subnet.  For example, 192.168.1.0/24 defines an 8 bit subnet
              consisting of the addresses 192.168.1.0 through 192.168.1.255.
              An optional suffix ",maxThreads=N" may be added to limit the
              number of threads used while probing.  The default is the
              value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the number of
              addresses in the subnet, whichever is less.  An optional
              suffix ",timeout=N" may be added to specify the timeout for
              each connection attempt in floating-point multiples of one
              second.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).
       shell  Probes the list of addresses provided by scripts for requested
              PCP service(s).  Several optional, comma-separated parameters
              can also be provided.  Firstly, the "path=DIR" option
              specifies the directory where commands like pcp-kube-pods(1)
              are located (defaults to $PCP_BINADM_DIR/discover/).  This
              setting can be further restricted to an individual command
              using the command=CMD option, but the default is to use all
              available commands from the path.  The "maxThreads=N" option
              limits the number of threads used while probing.  The default
              is the value of FD_SETSIZE (which is typically 1024) or the
              number of addresses returned by the scripts, whichever is
              less.  The "timeout=N" option may be added to limit the amount
              of time spent waiting for each connection attempt.  N is a
              floating point number specifying the number of seconds to
              wait.  The default is 0.02 seconds (20 milliseconds).
       mechanism may also be NULL, which means to use all available
       discovery mechanisms.
       For __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions, optionsString specifies global
       options to be applied to the discovery process.  Options are comma-
       separated and may be one or more of the following:
       resolve
              This requests that DNS name resolution be attempted for the
              addresses of any discovered services.
       timeout=N
              This specifies a timeout period after which the discovery
              process will be interrupted.  N is a floating point number
              representing the number of seconds before timing out.
       optionsString may also be NULL, which means that no global options
       are specified.
       For __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions, flags specifies a pointer to an
       object of type unsigned which is a bit mask of options/status flags
       for the discovery process.  The supported flags are:
       PM_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_RESOLVE
              Specifying this flag is equivalent to specifying resolve in
              the optionsString
       PM_SERVICE_DISCOVERY_INTERRUPTED
              This flag must be unset when calling
              __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions but may be set asynchronously
              (by an interrupt handler, for example) in order to interrupt
              the service discovery process.
       flags may also be NULL, which indicates that no flags are set.
       pmDiscoverServices and __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions will return
       the number of services discovered, else a value less than zero for an
       error.  The value zero indicates that no services were discovered.
       The resulting list of pointers, urls, and the values (the URLs) that
       the pointers reference will have been allocated by pmDiscoverServices
       or __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions with a single call to malloc(3),
       and it is the responsibility of the pmDiscoverServices or
       __pmDiscoverServicesWithOptions caller to free(urls) to release the
       space when it is no longer required.
       When an error occurs, or no services are discovered, urls is
       undefined (no space will have been allocated, and so calling free(3)
       is a singularly bad idea).
