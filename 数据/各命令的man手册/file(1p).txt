       The file utility shall perform a series of tests in sequence on each
       specified file in an attempt to classify it:
        1. If file does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could
           not be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was
           processed, but that its type could not be determined.
        2. If the file is not a regular file, its file type shall be
           identified.  The file types directory, FIFO, socket, block
           special, and character special shall be identified as such. Other
           implementation-defined file types may also be identified. If file
           is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved and
           file shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic link.
           (See the −h and −i options below.)
        3. If the length of file is zero, it shall be identified as an empty
           file.
        4. The file utility shall examine an initial segment of file and
           shall make a guess at identifying its contents based on position-
           sensitive tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct; see
           the −d, −M, and −m options below.)
        5. The file utility shall examine file and make a guess at
           identifying its contents based on context-sensitive default
           system tests. (The answer is not guaranteed to be correct.)
        6. The file shall be identified as a data file.
       If file does not exist, cannot be read, or its file status could not
       be determined, the output shall indicate that the file was processed,
       but that its type could not be determined.
       If file is a symbolic link, by default the link shall be resolved and
       file shall test the type of file referenced by the symbolic link.
