       The /etc/projects file provides a mapping between numeric project
       identifiers and those directories which are the roots of the quota
       tree.  Its format is simply:
            # comments are hash-prefixed
            # ...
            10:/export/cage
            42:/var/log
       The /etc/projects file is optional, instead xfs_quota(8) can be used
       with the -p argument to specify a project root directly for each
       operation.
