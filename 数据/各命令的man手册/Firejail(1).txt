       Firejail is a SUID sandbox program that reduces the risk of security
       breaches by restricting the running environment of untrusted
       applications using Linux namespaces, seccomp-bpf and Linux
       capabilities.  It allows a process and all its descendants to have
       their own private view of the globally shared kernel resources, such
       as the network stack, process table, mount table.  Firejail can work
       in a SELinux or AppArmor environment, and it is integrated with Linux
       Control Groups.
       Written in C with virtually no dependencies, the software runs on any
       Linux computer with a 3.x kernel version or newer.  It can sandbox
       any type of processes: servers, graphical applications, and even user
       login sessions.
       Firejail allows the user to manage application security using
       security profiles.  Each profile defines a set of permissions for a
       specific application or group of applications. The software includes
       security profiles for a number of more common Linux programs, such as
       Mozilla Firefox, Chromium, VLC, Transmission etc.
