       avc_init() is deprecated; please use avc_open(3) in conjunction with
       selinux_set_callback(3) in all new code.
       avc_init() initializes the userspace AVC and must be called before
       any other AVC operation can be performed.  A non-NULL msgprefix will
       be prepended to all audit messages produced by the userspace AVC.
       The default is `uavc'.  The remaining arguments, if non-NULL, specify
       callbacks to be used by the userspace AVC.
