       The <aio.h> header shall define the aiocb structure, which shall
       include at least the following members:
           int             aio_fildes     File descriptor.
           off_t           aio_offset     File offset.
           volatile void  *aio_buf        Location of buffer.
           size_t          aio_nbytes     Length of transfer.
           int             aio_reqprio    Request priority offset.
           struct sigevent aio_sigevent   Signal number and value.
           int             aio_lio_opcode Operation to be performed.
       The <aio.h> header shall define the off_t, pthread_attr_t, size_t,
       and ssize_t types as described in <sys/types.h>.
       The <aio.h> header shall define the struct timespec structure as
       described in <time.h>.
       The tag sigevent shall be declared as naming an incomplete structure
       type, the contents of which are described in the <signal.h> header.
       The <aio.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants:
       AIO_ALLDONE   A return value indicating that none of the requested
                     operations could be canceled since they are already
                     complete.
       AIO_CANCELED  A return value indicating that all requested operations
                     have been canceled.
       AIO_NOTCANCELED
                     A return value indicating that some of the requested
                     operations could not be canceled since they are in
                     progress.
       LIO_NOP       A lio_listio() element operation option indicating that
                     no transfer is requested.
       LIO_NOWAIT    A lio_listio() synchronization operation indicating
                     that the calling thread is to continue execution while
                     the lio_listio() operation is being performed, and no
                     notification is given when the operation is complete.
       LIO_READ      A lio_listio() element operation option requesting a
                     read.
       LIO_WAIT      A lio_listio() synchronization operation indicating
                     that the calling thread is to suspend until the
                     lio_listio() operation is complete.
       LIO_WRITE     A lio_listio() element operation option requesting a
                     write.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int      aio_cancel(int, struct aiocb *);
           int      aio_error(const struct aiocb *);
           int      aio_fsync(int, struct aiocb *);
           int      aio_read(struct aiocb *);
           ssize_t  aio_return(struct aiocb *);
           int      aio_suspend(const struct aiocb *const [], int,
                        const struct timespec *);
           int      aio_write(struct aiocb *);
           int      lio_listio(int, struct aiocb *restrict const [restrict], int,
                        struct sigevent *restrict);
       Inclusion of the <aio.h> header may make visible symbols defined in
       the headers <fcntl.h>, <signal.h>, and <time.h>.
       The following sections are informative.
