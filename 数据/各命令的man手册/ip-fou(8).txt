       The ip fou commands are used to create and delete receive ports for
       Foo-over-UDP (FOU) as well as Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE).
       Foo-over-UDP allows encapsulating packets of an IP protocol directly
       over UDP. The receiver infers the protocol of a packet received on a
       FOU UDP port to be the protocol configured for the port.
       Generic UDP Encapsulation (GUE) encapsulates packets of an IP
       protocol within UDP and an encapsulation header. The encapsulation
       header contains the IP protocol number for the encapsulated packet.
       When creating a FOU or GUE receive port, the port number is specified
       in PORT argument. If FOU is used, the IP protocol number associated
       with the port is specified in PROTO argument.
       A FOU or GUE receive port is deleted by specifying PORT in the delete
       command.
