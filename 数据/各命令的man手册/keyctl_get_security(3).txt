       keyctl_get_security() retrieves the security context of a key as a
       NUL-terminated string.  This will be rendered in a form appropriate
       to the LSM in force - for instance, with SELinux, it may look like
              unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023
       The caller must have view permission on a key to be able to get its
       security context.
       buffer and buflen specify the buffer into which the string will be
       placed.  If the buffer is too small, the full size of the string will
       be returned, and no copy will take place.
       keyctl_get_security_alloc() is similar to keyctl_get_security()
       except that it allocates a buffer big enough to hold the string and
       copies the string into it.  If successful, A pointer to the buffer is
       placed in *_buffer.  The caller must free the buffer.
