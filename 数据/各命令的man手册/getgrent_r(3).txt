       The functions getgrent_r() and fgetgrent_r() are the reentrant
       versions of getgrent(3) and fgetgrent(3).  The former reads the next
       group entry from the stream initialized by setgrent(3).  The latter
       reads the next group entry from stream.
       The group structure is defined in <grp.h> as follows:
           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;         /* NULL-terminated array of pointers
                                          to names of group members */
           };
       For more information about the fields of this structure, see
       group(5).
       The nonreentrant functions return a pointer to static storage, where
       this static storage contains further pointers to group name, password
       and members.  The reentrant functions described here return all of
       that in caller-provided buffers.  First of all there is the buffer
       gbuf that can hold a struct group.  And next the buffer buf of size
       buflen that can hold additional strings.  The result of these func‐
       tions, the struct group read from the stream, is stored in the pro‐
       vided buffer *gbuf, and a pointer to this struct group is returned in
       *gbufp.
