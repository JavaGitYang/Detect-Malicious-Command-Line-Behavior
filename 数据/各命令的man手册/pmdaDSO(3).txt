       pmdaDSO initializes the pmdaInterface structure to use the interface
       extensions, assuming the PMDA(3) is to be run as a DSO.  The
       pmdaInterface structure is initialized with:
       name           The name of the agent.
       helptext       The default path to the help text (see pmdaText(3)).
                      If no help text is installed, or you are not using
                      pmdaText(3), then this should be set to NULL,
                      otherwise helptext will be copied, so the storage
                      associated with helptext may be released after the
                      call to pmdaDSO.
       The callbacks are initialized to pmdaProfile(3), pmdaFetch(3),
       pmdaDesc(3), pmdaText(3), pmdaInstance(3) and pmdaStore(3).
       The interface structure also contains the domain of the PMDA(3),
       which is defined in the pmcd(1) configuration file. The domain is
       used to initialize the metric and instance descriptors (see
       pmdaInit(3)).
