       The pthread_attr_getinheritsched() and pthread_attr_setinheritsched()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the inheritsched attribute
       in the attr argument.
       When the attributes objects are used by pthread_create(), the
       inheritsched attribute determines how the other scheduling attributes
       of the created thread shall be set.
       The supported values of inheritsched shall be:
       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
             Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be
             inherited from the creating thread, and the scheduling
             attributes in this attr argument shall be ignored.
       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
             Specifies that the thread scheduling attributes shall be set to
             the corresponding values from this attributes object.
       The symbols PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED and PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED are
       defined in the <pthread.h> header.
       The following thread scheduling attributes defined by POSIX.1‚Äê2008
       are affected by the inheritsched attribute: scheduling policy
       (schedpolicy), scheduling parameters (schedparam), and scheduling
       contention scope (contentionscope).
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getinheritsched() or pthread_attr_setinheritsched()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
