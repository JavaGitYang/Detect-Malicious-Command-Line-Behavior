       Within the framework of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), archive logs
       of performance metrics values may be accumulated and saved using the
       program pmlogger(1).
       The routine pmGetArchiveLabel may be used to fetch the label record
       from a set of archive logs that has already been opened using
       pmNewContext(3), or pmDupContext(3), and thereby associated with the
       current Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
       context.
       The result returned via the pointer lp is a structure that must be
       pre-allocated by the caller and has the following format (defined in
       pmapi.h).
         /*
          * Label Record at the start of every log file
          */
         typedef struct {
           int        ll_magic;    /* PM_LOG_MAGIC | log format version no. */
           pid_t      ll_pid;      /* PID of logger */
           struct timeval ll_start;/* start of this log */
           char       ll_hostname[PM_LOG_MAXHOSTLEN]; /* name of collection host */
           char       ll_tz[40];   /* $TZ at collection host */
         } pmLogLabel;
       For an application, the most useful information from the archive
       label is likely to be in the fields ll_start, ll_hostname or ll_tz.
       Note that the size of the ll_hostname field is PM_LOG_MAXHOSTLEN (64
       bytes) which is less than MAXHOSTNAMELEN (see gethostbyname(3)) on
       some platforms.  These semantics are necessary to retain backwards
       compatibility with the PCP archive file format.
       pmGetArchiveLabel returns zero for success.
