       This function will set the maximum size of all handshake messages.
       Handshakes over this size are rejected with
       GNUTLS_E_HANDSHAKE_TOO_LARGE error code.  The default value is 128kb
       which is typically large enough.  Set this to 0 if you do not want to
       set an upper limit.
       The reason for restricting the handshake message sizes are to limit
       Denial of Service attacks.
       Note that the maximum handshake size was increased to 128kb from 48kb
       in GnuTLS 3.5.5.
