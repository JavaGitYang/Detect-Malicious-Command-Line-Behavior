       This function sets the filename of an OCSP response, that will be
       sent to the client if requests an OCSP certificate status for the
       certificate chain specified by  idx .
       This is a convenience function which may be inefficient on busy
       servers since the file is opened on every access. Use
       gnutls_certificate_set_ocsp_status_request_function2() to fine-tune
       file accesses.
