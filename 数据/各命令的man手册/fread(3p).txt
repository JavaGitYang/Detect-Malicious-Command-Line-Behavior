       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fread() function shall read into the array pointed to by ptr up
       to nitems elements whose size is specified by size in bytes, from the
       stream pointed to by stream.  For each object, size calls shall be
       made to the fgetc() function and the results stored, in the order
       read, in an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The
       file position indicator for the stream (if defined) shall be advanced
       by the number of bytes successfully read. If an error occurs, the
       resulting value of the file position indicator for the stream is
       unspecified. If a partial element is read, its value is unspecified.
       The fread() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), fscanf(), getc(), getchar(),
       getdelim(), getline(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that returns
       data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().
