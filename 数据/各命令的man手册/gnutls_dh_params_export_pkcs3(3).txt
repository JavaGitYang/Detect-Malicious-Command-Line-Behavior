       This function will export the given dh parameters to a PKCS3 DHParams
       structure. This is the format generated by "openssl dhparam" tool.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned.
       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN DH
       PARAMETERS".
