       pmdajbd2 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
       performance metrics from the Journal Block Device subsystem (version
       2) in the Linux kernel.  These metrics are exported by the kernel in
       procfs files, one file per block device.  The JBD2 subsystem is used
       by several filesystems including ext3, ext4 and ocfs2.
       The jbd2 PMDA exports metrics that measure detailed journal
       transaction information, such as time spent waiting and locked,
       request rates, blocks used and so on.
       A brief description of the pmdajbd2 command line options follows
       (these are only relevant when running the PMDA as a daemon, and not
       as a shared library):
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, when running as a daemon
            a log file named jbd2.log is written in the current directory of
            when pmdajbd2 is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.  When running in shared library
            mode, and diagnostic information will be written into the pmcd
            log file, namely $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log.
       -j   Allows an alternate path to the jbd2 statistics files to be
            specified.  The default path is /proc/fs/jbd2.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
