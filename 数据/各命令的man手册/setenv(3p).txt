       The setenv() function shall update or add a variable in the
       environment of the calling process. The envname argument points to a
       string containing the name of an environment variable to be added or
       altered. The environment variable shall be set to the value to which
       envval points. The function shall fail if envname points to a string
       which contains an '=' character. If the environment variable named by
       envname already exists and the value of overwrite is non-zero, the
       function shall return success and the environment shall be updated.
       If the environment variable named by envname already exists and the
       value of overwrite is zero, the function shall return success and the
       environment shall remain unchanged.
       The setenv() function shall update the list of pointers to which
       environ points.
       The strings described by envname and envval are copied by this
       function.
       The setenv() function need not be thread-safe.
