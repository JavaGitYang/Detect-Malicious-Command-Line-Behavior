       The LDIF backend to slapd(8) is a basic storage backend that stores
       entries in text files in LDIF format, and exploits the filesystem to
       create the tree structure of the database.  It is intended as a
       cheap, low performance easy to use backend, and it is exploited by
       higher-level internal structures to provide a permanent storage.
