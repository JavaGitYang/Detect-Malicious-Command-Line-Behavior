       The array of label sets returned by pmLookupLabels(3) and related
       APIs are allocated below the Performance Metrics Application
       Programming Interface (PMAPI) using a variety of calls to the
       system's dynamic memory allocation (i.e. malloc(3)) interfaces.
       Applications should call pmFreeLabelSets to release the storage
       previously allocated for the label sets array when access to the
       structure is no longer needed.  The return value from pmLookupLabels
       indicates the number of elements in the label sets array, and this
       should be passed in using the nsets parameter.
       Under no circumstances should an application use free(labelset) to
       release storage previously allocated for a pmLabelSet by
       pmLookupLabels(3) or related APIs.
