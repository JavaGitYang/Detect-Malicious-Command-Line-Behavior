       pmjson is used to manipulate JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)
       formatted text used in the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP toolkit).  It
       can produce minimal and human readable output formats when it is
       supplied with valid JSON input.
       The available command line options are as follows:
       -i|--in FILE
            JSON formatted input FILE - path to a file from which input
            should be read.  If this option is omitted, then pmjson will
            read from the standard input stream.
       -o|--out FILE
            Formatted output is written to the named FILE.  If this option
            is omitted, then pmjson will write to the standard output
            stream.
       -m|--minimal
            Produce JSON output with all superflous whitespace removed from
            the resulting JSON string.
       -p|--pretty
            Produce JSON output in a human-readable format.
       -q|--quiet
            Verify the input as valid JSON only, no output is produced.
       -y|--yaml
            Produce YAML-like output, a human-readable format with less
            syntactic sugar than JSON.
