       pmGetVersion returns a binary encoding of the locally installed PCP
       version number.
       This may be used in conjunction with the related macros
       PM_VERSION(a,b,c) and PM_VERSION_CURRENT that generate PCP version
       numbers in the same format.  Refer to the example below.
       The encoding uses one byte for each of the parts of the version
       number of the installed PCP package, namely the major number, the
       minor number and the revision number.  So PCP version 3.10.5 is
       encoded as 0x30a05.
       The string format of the installed PCP package version number as also
       available from pmGetConfig with the argument PCP_VERSION.
       pmGetVersion was introduced in PCP 3.10.5.
