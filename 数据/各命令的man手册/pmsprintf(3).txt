       Safe string formatting interface that wraps the vsnprintf(3) call.
       It differs primarily in that pmsprintf guarantees that the output
       buffer str will be null-terminated even when the provided buffer size
       is insufficient to contain the formatted string.  In this case a
       null-terminated truncated string will be returned in str.
       In the case of a failure in the underlying vsnprintf interface, a
       null-terminated empty string will be returned in str, and the return
       value will be zero.
