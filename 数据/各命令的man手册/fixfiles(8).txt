       This manual page describes the fixfiles script.
       This script is primarily used to correct the security context
       database (extended attributes) on filesystems.
       It can also be run at any time to relabel when adding support for new
       policy, or  just check whether the file contexts are all as you
       expect.  By default it will relabel all mounted ext2, ext3, xfs and
       jfs file systems as long as they do not have a security context mount
       option.  You can use the -R flag to use rpmpackages as an
       alternative.  The file /etc/selinux/fixfiles_exclude_dirs can contain
       a list of directories excluded from relabeling.
       fixfiles onboot will setup the machine to relabel on the next reboot.
