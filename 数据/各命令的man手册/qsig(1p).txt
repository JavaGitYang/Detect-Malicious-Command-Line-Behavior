       To signal a batch job is to send a signal to the session leader of
       the batch job. A batch job is signaled by sending a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The qsig utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the signaling of a batch job.
       The qsig utility shall signal those batch jobs for which a batch
       job_identifier is presented to the utility. The qsig utility shall
       not signal any batch jobs whose batch job_identifiers are not
       presented to the utility.
       The qsig utility shall signal batch jobs in the order in which the
       corresponding batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility. If
       the qsig utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qsig utility shall signal batch jobs by sending a Signal Job
       Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
       For each successfully processed batch job_identifier, the qsig
       utility shall have received a completion reply to each Signal Job
       Request sent to a batch server at the time the utility exits.
