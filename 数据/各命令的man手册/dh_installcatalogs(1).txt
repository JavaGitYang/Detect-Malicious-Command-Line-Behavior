       dh_installcatalogs is a debhelper program that installs and registers
       SGML catalogs. It complies with the Debian XML/SGML policy.
       Catalogs will be registered in a supercatalog, in
       /etc/sgml/package.cat.
       This command automatically adds maintainer script snippets for
       registering and unregistering the catalogs and supercatalogs (unless
       -n is used). These snippets are inserted into the maintainer scripts
       and the triggers file by dh_installdeb; see dh_installdeb(1) for an
       explanation of Debhelper maintainer script snippets.
       A dependency on sgml-base will be added to ${misc:Depends}, so be
       sure your package uses that variable in debian/control.
