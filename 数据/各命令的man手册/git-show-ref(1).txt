       Displays references available in a local repository along with the
       associated commit IDs. Results can be filtered using a pattern and
       tags can be dereferenced into object IDs. Additionally, it can be
       used to test whether a particular ref exists.
       By default, shows the tags, heads, and remote refs.
       The --exclude-existing form is a filter that does the inverse. It
       reads refs from stdin, one ref per line, and shows those that donâ€™t
       exist in the local repository.
       Use of this utility is encouraged in favor of directly accessing
       files under the .git directory.
