       The uuid_unparse function converts the supplied UUID uu from the
       binary representation into a 36-byte string (plus tailing '\0') of
       the form 1b4e28ba-2fa1-11d2-883f-0016d3cca427 and stores this value
       in the character string pointed to by out.  The case of the hex
       digits returned by uuid_unparse may be upper or lower case, and is
       dependent on the system-dependent local default.
       If the case of the hex digits is important then the functions
       uuid_unparse_upper and uuid_unparse_lower may be used.
