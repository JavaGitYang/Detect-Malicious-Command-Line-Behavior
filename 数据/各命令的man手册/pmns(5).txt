       When using the Performance Metrics Programming Interface (PMAPI) of
       the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), performance metrics are identified by
       an external name in a hierarchic Performance Metrics Name Space
       (PMNS), and an internal identifier, the Performance Metric Identifier
       (PMID).
       A PMNS specifies the association between a metric's name and its
       PMID.
       A PMNS is defined on one or more ASCII source files.
       Loading of a PMNS is done by calling pmLoadNameSpace(3) or
       pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3).
       As of Version 3.10.3 of PCP, by default duplicate names for the same
       PMID are allowed in the PMNS, although pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3)
       provides an alternative interface with user-defined control over the
       processing of duplicate names in the PMNS.  The external format for a
       PMNS conforms to the syntax and semantics described in the following
       sections.
       There is one default PMNS in the files below $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns,
       although users and application developers are free to create and use
       alternate PMNS's.  For an example of this, see the PCP Tutorial in
       $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/Tutorial.
       Although an application can call pmLoadNameSpace(3), normally this is
       only done directly for the -n command line option where an explicit
       root PMNS file is specified.  Since PCP version 2 uses a distributed
       PMNS (see below), an application can extract PMNS information from a
       host's PMCD or an archive.  If the PMNS source is a version 1 archive
       (see PCPIntro(1)), however, then the local PMNS will be loaded using
       the path specified by the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT.
