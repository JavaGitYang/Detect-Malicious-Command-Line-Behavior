       The <poll.h> header shall define the pollfd structure, which shall
       include at least the following members:
           int    fd       The following descriptor being polled.
           short  events   The input event flags (see below).
           short  revents  The output event flags (see below).
       The <poll.h> header shall define the following type through typedef:
       nfds_t        An unsigned integer type used for the number of file
                     descriptors.
       The implementation shall support one or more programming environments
       in which the width of nfds_t is no greater than the width of type
       long.  The names of these programming environments can be obtained
       using the confstr() function or the getconf utility.
       The <poll.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants,
       zero or more of which may be OR'ed together to form the events or
       revents members in the pollfd structure:
       POLLIN        Data other than high-priority data may be read without
                     blocking.
       POLLRDNORM    Normal data may be read without blocking.
       POLLRDBAND    Priority data may be read without blocking.
       POLLPRI       High priority data may be read without blocking.
       POLLOUT       Normal data may be written without blocking.
       POLLWRNORM    Equivalent to POLLOUT.
       POLLWRBAND    Priority data may be written.
       POLLERR       An error has occurred (revents only).
       POLLHUP       Device has been disconnected (revents only).
       POLLNVAL      Invalid fd member (revents only).
       The significance and semantics of normal, priority, and high-priority
       data are file and device-specific.
       The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
       as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
           int   poll(struct pollfd [], nfds_t, int);
