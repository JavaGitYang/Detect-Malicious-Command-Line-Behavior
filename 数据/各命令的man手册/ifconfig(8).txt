       Ifconfig is used to configure the kernel-resident network interfaces.
       It is used at boot time to set up interfaces as necessary.  After
       that, it is usually only needed when debugging or when system tuning
       is needed.
       If no arguments are given, ifconfig displays the status of the
       currently active interfaces.  If a single interface argument is
       given, it displays the status of the given interface only; if a
       single -a argument is given, it displays the status of all
       interfaces, even those that are down.  Otherwise, it configures an
       interface.
