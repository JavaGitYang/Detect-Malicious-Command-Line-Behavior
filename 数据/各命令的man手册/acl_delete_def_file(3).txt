     The acl_delete_def_file() function deletes a default ACL from the
     directory whose pathname is pointed to by the argument path_p.
     The effective user ID of the process must match the owner of the file
     or directory or the process must have the CAP_FOWNER capability for the
     request to succeed.
     If the argument path_p is not a directory, then the function fails. It
     is no error if the directory whose pathname is pointed to by the argu‚Äê
     ment path_p does not have a default ACL.
