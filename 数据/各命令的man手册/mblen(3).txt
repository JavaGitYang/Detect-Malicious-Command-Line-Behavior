       If s is not NULL, the mblen() function inspects at most n bytes of
       the multibyte string starting at s and extracts the next complete
       multibyte character.  It uses a static anonymous shift state known
       only to the mblen() function.  If the multibyte character is not the
       null wide character, it returns the number of bytes that were
       consumed from s.  If the multibyte character is the null wide
       character, it returns 0.
       If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete multibyte
       character, mblen() returns -1.  This can happen even if n is greater
       than or equal to MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte string contains
       redundant shift sequences.
       If the multibyte string starting at s contains an invalid multibyte
       sequence before the next complete character, mblen() also returns -1.
       If s is NULL, the mblen() function resets the shift state, known to
       only this function, to the initial state, and returns nonzero if the
       encoding has nontrivial shift state, or zero if the encoding is
       stateless.
