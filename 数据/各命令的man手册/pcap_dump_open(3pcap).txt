       pcap_dump_open() is called to open a ``savefile'' for writing.  fname
       specifies the name of the file to open. The file will have the same
       format as those used by tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1).  The name "-" is
       a synonym for stdout.
       pcap_dump_fopen() is called to write data to an existing open stream
       fp.  Note that on Windows, that stream should be opened in binary
       mode.
       p is a capture or ``savefile'' handle returned by an earlier call to
       pcap_create() and activated by an earlier call to pcap_activate(), or
       returned by an earlier call to pcap_open_offline(), pcap_open_live(),
       or pcap_open_dead().  The time stamp precision, link-layer type, and
       snapshot length from p are used as the link-layer type and snapshot
       length of the output file.
       pcap_dump_open_append() is like pcap_dump_open but does not create
       the file if it does not exist and, if it does already exist, and is a
       pcap file with the same byte order as the host opening the file, and
       has the same time stamp precision, link-layer header type, and
       snapshot length as p, it will write new packets at the end of the
       file.
