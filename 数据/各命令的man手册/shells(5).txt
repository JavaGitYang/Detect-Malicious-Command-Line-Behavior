       /etc/shells is a text file which contains the full pathnames of valid
       login shells.  This file is consulted by chsh(1) and available to be
       queried by other programs.
       Be aware that there are programs which consult this file to find out
       if a user is a normal user; for example, FTP daemons traditionally
       disallow access to users with shells not included in this file.
