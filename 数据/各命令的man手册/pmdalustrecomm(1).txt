       pmdalustrecomm is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics from the Linux procfs filesystem about
       the state of various aspects of the Lustre filesystem.
       The lustrecomm PMDA exports metrics that focus on distributed
       communication in the filesystem, including metrics related to
       timeouts, network drops, send/recv information and route lengths.
       However, it also covers the memory use of some of the Lustre
       filesystem components.
       A brief description of the pmdalustrecomm command line options
       follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            lustrecomm.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
            when pmdalustrecomm is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
