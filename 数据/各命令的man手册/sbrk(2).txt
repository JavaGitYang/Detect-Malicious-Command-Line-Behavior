       brk() and sbrk() change the location of the program break, which
       defines the end of the process's data segment (i.e., the program
       break is the first location after the end of the uninitialized data
       segment).  Increasing the program break has the effect of allocating
       memory to the process; decreasing the break deallocates memory.
       brk() sets the end of the data segment to the value specified by
       addr, when that value is reasonable, the system has enough memory,
       and the process does not exceed its maximum data size (see
       setrlimit(2)).
       sbrk() increments the program's data space by increment bytes.
       Calling sbrk() with an increment of 0 can be used to find the current
       location of the program break.
