       sockatmark() returns a value indicating whether or not the socket
       referred to by the file descriptor sockfd is at the out-of-band mark.
       If the socket is at the mark, then 1 is returned; if the socket is
       not at the mark, 0 is returned.  This function does not remove the
       out-of-band mark.
