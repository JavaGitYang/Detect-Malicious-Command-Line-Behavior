       The strtod(), strtof(), and strtold() functions convert the initial
       portion of the string pointed to by nptr to double, float, and long
       double representation, respectively.
       The expected form of the (initial portion of the) string is optional
       leading white space as recognized by isspace(3), an optional plus
       ('+') or minus sign ('-') and then either (i) a decimal number, or
       (ii) a hexadecimal number, or (iii) an infinity, or (iv) a NAN (not-
       a-number).
       A decimal number consists of a nonempty sequence of decimal digits
       possibly containing a radix character (decimal point, locale-
       dependent, usually '.'), optionally followed by a decimal exponent.
       A decimal exponent consists of an 'E' or 'e', followed by an optional
       plus or minus sign, followed by a nonempty sequence of decimal
       digits, and indicates multiplication by a power of 10.
       A hexadecimal number consists of a "0x" or "0X" followed by a
       nonempty sequence of hexadecimal digits possibly containing a radix
       character, optionally followed by a binary exponent.  A binary
       exponent consists of a 'P' or 'p', followed by an optional plus or
       minus sign, followed by a nonempty sequence of decimal digits, and
       indicates multiplication by a power of 2.  At least one of radix
       character and binary exponent must be present.
       An infinity is either "INF" or "INFINITY", disregarding case.
       A NAN is "NAN" (disregarding case) optionally followed by a string,
       (n-char-sequence), where n-char-sequence specifies in an
       implementation-dependent way the type of NAN (see NOTES).
