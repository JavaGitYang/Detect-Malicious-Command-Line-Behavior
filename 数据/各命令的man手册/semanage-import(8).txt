       semanage is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy
       without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy
       sources.  semanage import and export can be used to extract the
       SELinux modifications from one machine and apply them to another. You
       can put a whole group of semanage commands within a file and apply
       them to a machine in a single transaction.
