       Section 3 of the manual describes all library functions excluding the
       library functions (system call wrappers) described in Section 2,
       which implement system calls.
       Many of the functions described in the section are part of the
       Standard C Library (libc).  Some functions are part of other
       libraries (e.g., the math library, libm, or the real-time library,
       librt) in which case the manual page will indicate the linker option
       needed to link against the required library (e.g., -lm and -lrt,
       respectively, for the aforementioned libraries).
       In some cases, the programmer must define a feature test macro in
       order to obtain the declaration of a function from the header file
       specified in the man page SYNOPSIS section.  (Where required, these
       feature test macros must be defined before including any header
       files.)  In such cases, the required macro is described in the man
       page.  For further information on feature test macros, see
       feature_test_macros(7).
