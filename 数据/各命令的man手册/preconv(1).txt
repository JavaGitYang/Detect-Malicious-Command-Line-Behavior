       preconv reads files and converts its encoding(s) to a form GNU
       troff(1) can process, sending the data to standard output.
       Currently, this means ASCII characters and ‘\[uXXXX]’ entities, where
       ‘XXXX’ is a hexadecimal number with four to six digits, representing
       a Unicode input code.  Normally, preconv should be invoked with the
       -k and -K options of groff.
