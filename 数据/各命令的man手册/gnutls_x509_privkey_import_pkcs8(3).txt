       This function will convert the given DER or PEM encoded PKCS8 2.0
       encrypted key to the native gnutls_x509_privkey_t format. The output
       will be stored in  key .  Both RSA and DSA keys can be imported, and
       flags can only be used to indicate an unencrypted key.
       The  password can be either ASCII or UTF-8 in the default PBES2
       encryption schemas, or ASCII for the PKCS12 schemas.
       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of
       "ENCRYPTED PRIVATE KEY", or "PRIVATE KEY". You only need to specify
       the flags if the key is DER encoded, since in that case the
       encryption status cannot be auto-detected.
       If the GNUTLS_PKCS_PLAIN flag is specified and the supplied data are
       encrypted then GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED is returned.
