       dh_installemacsen is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by the Debian emacsen-common package into
       package build directories.
       It also automatically generates the preinst postinst and prerm
       commands needed to register a package as an Emacs add on package. The
       commands are added to the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb. See
       dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of how this works.
