       The fdopendir() function shall be equivalent to the opendir()
       function except that the directory is specified by a file descriptor
       rather than by a name. The file offset associated with the file
       descriptor at the time of the call determines which entries are
       returned.
       Upon successful return from fdopendir(), the file descriptor is under
       the control of the system, and if any attempt is made to close the
       file descriptor, or to modify the state of the associated
       description, other than by means of closedir(), readdir(),
       readdir_r(), rewinddir(), or seekdir(), the behavior is undefined.
       Upon calling closedir() the file descriptor shall be closed.
       It is unspecified whether the FD_CLOEXEC flag will be set on the file
       descriptor by a successful call to fdopendir().
       The opendir() function shall open a directory stream corresponding to
       the directory named by the dirname argument. The directory stream is
       positioned at the first entry. If the type DIR is implemented using a
       file descriptor, applications shall only be able to open up to a
       total of {OPEN_MAX} files and directories.
       If the type DIR is implemented using a file descriptor, the
       descriptor shall be obtained as if the O_DIRECTORY flag was passed to
       open().
