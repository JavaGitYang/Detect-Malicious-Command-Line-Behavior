       ausearch_set_stop determines where the internal cursor will stop when
       a search condition is met. The possible values are:
              AUSEARCH_STOP_EVENT
                     This one repositions the cursors to the first field of
                     the first record of the event containing the items
                     searched for.
              AUSEARCH_STOP_RECORD
                     This one repositions the cursors to the first field of
                     the record containing the items searched for.
              AUSEARCH_STOP_FIELD
                     This one simply stops on the current field when the
                     evaluation of the rules becomes true.
