       This command is used to query and alter the yum database, which is a
       simple key value store used in conjunction with the rpm database. Any
       installed package can have arbitrary data in the yum database,
       however the main use case is to store extra data about packages as
       they are installed.
       yumdb commands are:
       yumdb get <key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will get the value for the given key, limiting to any
       specified packages.
       yumdb set <key> <value> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will set the value for the given key, to the given
       value, limiting to any specified packages.
       yumdb del <key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will delete the given key, limiting to any specified
       packages.
       yumdb rename <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will rename the given old-key, to the given new-key,
       limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist,
       nothing happens.
       yumdb rename-force <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will rename the given old-key, to the given new-key,
       limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist,
       new-key is deleted.
       yumdb copy <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will copy the given old-key, to the given new-key,
       limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist,
       nothing happens.
       yumdb copy-force <old-key> <new-key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will copy the given old-key, to the given new-key,
       limiting to any specified packages. If the old-key does not exist,
       new-key is deleted.
       yumdb search <key> <wildcard>...
       This command will search all packages for the given key, against any
       of the given wildcard values.
       yumdb exist <key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will print any packages which have the given key,
       limiting to any specified packages.
       yumdb unset <key> [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will print any packages which do not have the given key,
       limiting to any specified packages.
       yumdb info [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will display all the data stored in the yumdb, limiting
       to any specified packages.
       yumdb sync [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will add any missing data to the yumdb from the
       repositories, limiting to any specified packages. This is useful to
       run if you have had any aborted transactions (and thus. missing yumdb
       data).  Note that "yumdb sync" cannot know all the information that
       would have been put into the yumdb at the time.
       yumdb sync-force [pkg-wildcard]...
       This command will replace any data in the yumdb from the
       repositories, limiting to any specified packages.
