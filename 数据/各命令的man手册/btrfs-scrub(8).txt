       btrfs scrub is used to scrub a btrfs filesystem, which will read all
       data and metadata blocks from all devices and verify checksums.
       Automatically repair corrupted blocks if thereâ€™s a correct copy
       available.
           Note
           Scrub is not a filesystem checker (fsck) and does not verify nor
           repair structural damage in the filesystem.
       The user is supposed to run it manually or via a periodic system
       service. The recommended period is a month but could be less. The
       estimated device bandwidth utilization is about 80% on an idle
       filesystem. The IO priority class is by default idle so background
       scrub should not significantly interfere with normal filesystem
       operation.
       The scrubbing status is recorded in /var/lib/btrfs/ in textual files
       named scrub.status.UUID for a filesystem identified by the given
       UUID. (Progress state is communicated through a named pipe in file
       scrub.progress.UUID in the same directory.) The status file is
       updated every 5 seconds. A resumed scrub will continue from the last
       saved position.
