       fsck.btrfs is a type of utility that should exist for any filesystem
       and is called during system setup when the corresponding /etc/fstab
       entries contain non-zero value for fs_passno, see fstab(5) for more.
       Traditional filesystems need to run their respective fsck utility in
       case the filesystem was not unmounted cleanly and the log needs to be
       replayed before mount. This is not needed for BTRFS. You should set
       fs_passno to 0.
       If you wish to check the consistency of a BTRFS filesystem or repair
       a damaged filesystem, see btrfs-check(8). By default filesystem
       consistency is checked, the repair mode is enabled via the --repair
       option (use with care!).
