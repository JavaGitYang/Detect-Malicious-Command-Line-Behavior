       pmdaib is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       information and performance metrics about local Infiniband HCAs and
       local or remote Infiniband GUIDs.
       A brief description of the pmdaib command line options follows:
       -c   Location of the config file.  By default, the config file is
            named $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/infiniband/config.  See CONFIG FILE for
            more information.
       -D   A debug values, as specified by pmdbg(1)
       -d   Specify an alternate performance metrics domain number.  Almost
            never necessary.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named ib.log
            is written to $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
       -w   Write out the default config file to $PCP_PMDAS_DIRS/infiniband
            and exit immediately.  The written config file will contain the
            local HCA ports.  It will not overwrite an existing file.  This
            argument should only be used to create the template config file
            and should never appear in pmcd.conf.  See CONFIG FILE for more
            information on the file format and on monitoring remote GUIDs.
