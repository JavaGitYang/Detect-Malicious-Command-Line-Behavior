       rdisc implements client side of the ICMP router discover protocol.
       rdisc is invoked at boot time to populate the network routing tables
       with default routes.
       rdisc listens on the ALL_HOSTS (224.0.0.1) multicast address (or
       receive_address provided it is given) for ROUTER_ADVERTISE messages
       from routers. The received messages are handled by first ignoring
       those listed router addresses with which the host does not share a
       network. Among the remaining addresses the ones with the highest
       preference are selected as default routers and a default route is
       entered in the kernel routing table for each one of them.
       Optionally, rdisc can avoid waiting for routers to announce
       themselves by sending out a few ROUTER_SOLICITATION messages to the
       ALL_ROUTERS (224.0.0.2) multicast address (or send_address provided
       it is given) when it is started.
       A timer is associated with each router address and the address will
       no longer be considered for inclusion in the the routing tables if
       the timer expires before a new advertise message is received from the
       router. The address will also be excluded from consideration if the
       host receives an advertise message with the preference being
       maximally negative.
       Server side of router discovery protocol is supported by Cisco IOS
       and by any more or less complete UNIX routing daemon, f.e gated. Or,
       rdisc can act as responder, if compiled with -DRDISC_SERVER.
