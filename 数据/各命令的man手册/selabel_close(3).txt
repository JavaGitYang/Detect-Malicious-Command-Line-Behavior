       selabel_open() is used to initialize a labeling handle to be used for
       lookup operations.  The backend argument specifies which backend is
       to be opened; the list of current backends appears in BACKENDS below.
       The options argument should be NULL or a pointer to an array of
       selinux_opt structures of length nopt:
              struct selinux_opt {
                  int         type;
                  const char  *value;
              };
       The available option types are described in GLOBAL OPTIONS below as
       well as in the documentation for each individual backend.  The return
       value on success is a non-NULL value for use in subsequent label
       operations.
       selabel_close() terminates use of a handle, freeing any internal
       resources associated with it.  After this call has been made, the
       handle must not be used again.
