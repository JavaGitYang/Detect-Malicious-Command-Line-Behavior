       This function will extract the raw key (or DN) ID of the Basic OCSP
       Response in the provided buffer. If the responder ID is not a key ID
       then this function will return GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.
       The caller needs to deallocate memory by calling gnutls_free() on
        dn ->data.
