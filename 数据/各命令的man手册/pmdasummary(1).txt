       pmdasummary is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       derives performance metrics values from values made available by
       other PMDAs.  pmdasummary consists of two processes:
       pmie process
              The inference engine for performance values pmie(1) is used to
              periodically sample values for the base metrics and compute
              the derived values.  This process is launched with the given
              pmie-command-line arguments by the main process, described
              below.
       main process
              The main process reads and buffers the values computed by
              pmie(1) and makes them available to the performance metrics
              collector daemon pmcd(1).
       A brief description of the pmdasummary command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -h   This option specifies an alternative help text file helpfile for
            describing the metrics that pmdasummary represents.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            summary.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdasummary is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
