       Take one or more git commits at the base of the current stack and
       turn them into StGIT patches. The new patches are created as applied
       patches at the bottom of the stack. This is the opposite of stg
       commit.
       By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by the
       number of patch names provided on the command line. First name is
       used for the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for the newest patch.
       The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to uncommit.
       In this case, at most one patch name may be specified. It is used as
       prefix to which the patch number is appended. If no patch names are
       provided on the command line, StGIT automatically generates them
       based on the first line of the patch description.
       The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including the
       given commit should be uncommitted.
       Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
       words, you canâ€™t uncommit a merge.
