       The file contains local user definitions in the form of policy
       language user statements and is only found on older SELinux systems
       as it has been deprecated and replaced by the semange(8) services.
       This file is only read by selinux_mkload_policy(3) when SETLOCALDEFS
       in the SELinux config file (see selinux_config(5)) is set to 1.
       selinux_users_path(3) will return the active policy path to the
       directory where this file is located. The default local users file
       is:
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/users/local.users
       Where {SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux configuration file
       config (see selinux_config(5)).
