       The lttng help command displays help information about an LTTng
       command.
       This command is the equivalent of:
           $ lttng COMMAND --help
       where COMMAND is the name of the command about which to get help. If
       COMMAND is omitted, lttng help shows general help about the lttng(1)
       command.
       The lttng help command attempts to launch /usr/bin/man to view the
       commandâ€™s man page. The path to the man pager can be overridden by
       the LTTNG_MAN_BIN_PATH environment variable.
