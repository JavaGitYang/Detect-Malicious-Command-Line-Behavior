       When processing event records, if pmUnpackEventRecords(3) is used to
       unpack event records from a metric within a pmResult structure with a
       value of type PM_TYPE_EVENT then the structure returned from
       pmUnpackEventRecords(3) is a NULL pointer terminated array of
       pointers to pmResult structures, one for each event record.
       pmFreeEventResult is a convenience method that frees all of the
       pmResult structures and the array of pointers (rset).
       Similarly, pmFreeHighResEventResult may be used to free the
       pmHighResResult structures and array returned from the
       pmUnpackHighResEventRecords routine when using PM_TYPE_HIGHRES_EVENT
       metrics.
