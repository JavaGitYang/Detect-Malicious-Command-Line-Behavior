       Clones a repository into a newly created directory, creates
       remote-tracking branches for each branch in the cloned repository
       (visible using git branch -r), and creates and checks out an initial
       branch that is forked from the cloned repositoryâ€™s currently active
       branch.
       After the clone, a plain git fetch without arguments will update all
       the remote-tracking branches, and a git pull without arguments will
       in addition merge the remote master branch into the current master
       branch, if any (this is untrue when "--single-branch" is given; see
       below).
       This default configuration is achieved by creating references to the
       remote branch heads under refs/remotes/origin and by initializing
       remote.origin.url and remote.origin.fetch configuration variables.
