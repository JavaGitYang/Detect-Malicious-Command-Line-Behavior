       The securetty_types file contains a list of types associated to
       secure tty type that are defined in the policy for use by SELinux-
       aware applications.
       selinux_securetty_types_path(3) will return the active policy path to
       this file. The default securetty types file is:
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/securetty_types
       Where {SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux configuration file
       config (see selinux_config(5)).
       selinux_check_securetty_context(3) reads this file to determine if a
       context is for a secure tty defined in the active policy.
       SELinux-aware applications such as newrole(1) use this information to
       check the status of a tty.
