       The sh utility is a command language interpreter that shall execute
       commands read from a command line string, the standard input, or a
       specified file. The application shall ensure that the commands to be
       executed are expressed in the language described in Chapter 2, Shell
       Command Language.
       Pathname expansion shall not fail due to the size of a file.
       Shell input and output redirections have an implementation-defined
       offset maximum that is established in the open file description.
