       The function _exit() terminates the calling process "immediately".
       Any open file descriptors belonging to the process are closed.  Any
       children of the process are inherited by init(1) (or by the nearest
       "subreaper" process as defined through the use of the prctl(2)
       PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER operation).  The process's parent is sent a
       SIGCHLD signal.
       The value status & 0377 is returned to the parent process as the
       process's exit status, and can be collected using one of the wait(2)
       family of calls.
       The function _Exit() is equivalent to _exit().
