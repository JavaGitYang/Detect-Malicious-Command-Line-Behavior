       Send a patch or a range of patches by e-mail using the SMTP server
       specified by the stgit.smtpserver configuration option, or the
       --smtp-server command line option. This option can also be an
       absolute path to sendmail followed by command line arguments.
       The From address and the e-mail format are generated from the
       template file passed as argument to --template (defaulting to
       .git/patchmail.tmpl or ~/.stgit/templates/patchmail.tmpl or
       /usr/share/stgit/templates/patchmail.tmpl). A patch can be sent as
       attachment using the --attach option in which case the mailattch.tmpl
       template will be used instead of patchmail.tmpl.
       The To/Cc/Bcc addresses can either be added to the template file or
       passed via the corresponding command line options. They can be e-mail
       addresses or aliases which are automatically expanded to the values
       stored in the [mail "alias"] section of GIT configuration files.
       A preamble e-mail can be sent using the --cover and/or --edit-cover
       options. The first allows the user to specify a file to be used as a
       template. The latter option will invoke the editor on the specified
       file (defaulting to .git/covermail.tmpl or
       ~/.stgit/templates/covermail.tmpl or
       /usr/share/stgit/templates/covermail.tmpl).
       All the subsequent e-mails appear as replies to the first e-mail sent
       (either the preamble or the first patch). E-mails can be seen as
       replies to a different e-mail by using the --in-reply-to option.
       SMTP authentication is also possible with --smtp-user and
       --smtp-password options, also available as configuration settings:
       smtpuser and smtppassword. TLS encryption can be enabled by
       --smtp-tls option and smtptls setting.
       The following variables are accepted by both the preamble and the
       patch e-mail templates:
           %(diffstat)s     - diff statistics
           %(number)s       - empty if only one patch is sent or 'patchnr/totalnr'
           %(snumber)s      - stripped version of '%(number)s'
           %(nspace)s       - ' ' if %(number)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string
           %(patchnr)s      - patch number
           %(sender)s       - 'sender'  or 'authname <authemail>' as per the config file
           %(totalnr)s      - total number of patches to be sent
           %(version)s      - 'version' string passed on the command line (or empty)
           %(vspace)s       - ' ' if %(version)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string
       In addition to the common variables, the preamble e-mail template
       accepts the following:
           %(shortlog)s     - first line of each patch description, listed by author
       In addition to the common variables, the patch e-mail template
       accepts the following:
           %(authdate)s     - patch creation date
           %(authemail)s    - author's email
           %(authname)s     - author's name
           %(commemail)s    - committer's e-mail
           %(commname)s     - committer's name
           %(diff)s         - unified diff of the patch
           %(fromauth)s     - 'From: author\n\n' if different from sender
           %(longdescr)s    - the rest of the patch description, after the first line
           %(patch)s        - patch name
           %(prefix)s       - 'prefix' string passed on the command line
           %(pspace)s       - ' ' if %(prefix)s is non-empty, otherwise empty string
           %(shortdescr)s   - the first line of the patch description
