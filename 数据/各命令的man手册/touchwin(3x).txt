       The touchwin and touchline routines throw away all optimization
       information about which parts of the window have been touched, by
       pretending that the entire window has been drawn on.  This is
       sometimes necessary when using overlapping windows, since a change to
       one window affects the other window, but the records of which lines
       have been changed in the other window do not reflect the change.  The
       routine touchline only pretends that count lines have been changed,
       beginning with line start.
       The untouchwin routine marks all lines in the window as unchanged
       since the last call to wrefresh.
       The wtouchln routine makes n lines in the window, starting at line y,
       look as if they have (changed=1) or have not (changed=0) been changed
       since the last call to wrefresh.
       The is_linetouched and is_wintouched routines return TRUE if the
       specified line/window was modified since the last call to wrefresh;
       otherwise they return FALSE.  In addition, is_linetouched returns ERR
       if line is not valid for the given window.
