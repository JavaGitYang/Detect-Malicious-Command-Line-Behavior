       dh_auto_configure is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       configure a package prior to building. It does so by running the
       appropriate command for the build system it detects the package uses.
       For example, it looks for and runs a ./configure script, Makefile.PL,
       Build.PL, or cmake. A standard set of parameters is determined and
       passed to the program that is run. Some build systems, such as make,
       do not need a configure step; for these dh_auto_configure will exit
       without doing anything.
       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_configure at all, and
       just run ./configure or its equivalent manually.
