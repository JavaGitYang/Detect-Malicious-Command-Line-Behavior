       This function makes it possible for a client program to find out
       which optional features are available in the version of the PCRE
       library it is using. The arguments are as follows:
         what     A code specifying what information is required
         where    Points to where to put the data
       The where argument must point to an integer variable, except for
       PCRE_CONFIG_MATCH_LIMIT, PCRE_CONFIG_MATCH_LIMIT_RECURSION, and
       PCRE_CONFIG_PARENS_LIMIT, when it must point to an unsigned long
       integer, and for PCRE_CONFIG_JITTARGET, when it must point to a const
       char*.  The available codes are:

       compiler,
                                     or NULL if there is no JIT support

         PCRE_CONFIG_NEWLINE       Value of the default newline sequence:
                                       13 (0x000d)    for CR
                                       10 (0x000a)    for LF
                                     3338 (0x0d0a)    for CRLF
                                       -2             for ANYCRLF
                                       -1             for ANY
         PCRE_CONFIG_BSR           Indicates what \R matches by default:
                                        0             all Unicode line
       endings
                                        1             CR, LF, or CRLF only
         PCRE_CONFIG_POSIX_MALLOC_THRESHOLD
                                   Threshold of return slots, above which
                                     malloc() is used by the POSIX API
         PCRE_CONFIG_STACKRECURSE  Recursion implementation (1=stack 0=heap)
         PCRE_CONFIG_UTF16         Availability of UTF-16 support (1=yes
                                      0=no); option for pcre16_config()
         PCRE_CONFIG_UTF32         Availability of UTF-32 support (1=yes
                                      0=no); option for pcre32_config()
         PCRE_CONFIG_UTF8          Availability of UTF-8 support (1=yes
       0=no);
                                     option for pcre_config()
         PCRE_CONFIG_UNICODE_PROPERTIES
                                   Availability of Unicode property support
                                     (1=yes 0=no)
       The function yields 0 on success or PCRE_ERROR_BADOPTION otherwise.
       That error is also given if PCRE_CONFIG_UTF16 or PCRE_CONFIG_UTF32 is
       passed to pcre_config(), if PCRE_CONFIG_UTF8 or PCRE_CONFIG_UTF32 is
       passed to pcre16_config(), or if PCRE_CONFIG_UTF8 or
       PCRE_CONFIG_UTF16 is passed to pcre32_config().
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
