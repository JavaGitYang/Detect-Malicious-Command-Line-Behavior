       The getpeername() function shall retrieve the peer address of the
       specified socket, store this address in the sockaddr structure
       pointed to by the address argument, and store the length of this
       address in the object pointed to by the address_len argument.
       The address_len argument points to a socklen_t object which on input
       specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, and on
       output specifies the length of the stored address.  If the actual
       length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied
       sockaddr structure, the stored address shall be truncated.
       If the protocol permits connections by unbound clients, and the peer
       is not bound, then the value stored in the object pointed to by
       address is unspecified.
