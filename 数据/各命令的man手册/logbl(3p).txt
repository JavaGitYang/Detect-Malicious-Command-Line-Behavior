       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       These functions shall compute the exponent of x, which is the
       integral part of logr |x|, as a signed floating-point value, for non-
       zero x, where r is the radix of the machine's floating-point
       arithmetic, which is the value of FLT_RADIX defined in the <float.h>
       header.
       If x is subnormal it is treated as though it were normalized; thus
       for finite positive x:
           1 <= x * FLT_RADIX−logb(x) < FLT_RADIX
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
