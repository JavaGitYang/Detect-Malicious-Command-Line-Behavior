       script makes a typescript of everything displayed on your terminal.
       It is useful for students who need a hardcopy record of an
       interactive session as proof of an assignment, as the typescript file
       can be printed out later with lpr(1).
       If the argument file is given, script saves the dialogue in this
       file.  If no filename is given, the dialogue is saved in the file
       typescript.
