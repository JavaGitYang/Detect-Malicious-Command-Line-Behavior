     A tutorial sampler for writing BSD manual pages with the -mdoc macro
     package, a content-based and domain-based formatting package for
     troff(1).  Its predecessor, the -man(7) package, addressed page layout,
     leaving the manipulation of fonts and other typesetting details to the
     individual author.  In -mdoc, page layout macros make up the page
     structure domain which consists of macros for titles, section headers,
     displays and lists.  Essentially items which affect the physical posi‐
     tion of text on a formatted page.  In addition to the page structure
     domain, there are two more domains, the manual domain and the general
     text domain.  The general text domain is defined as macros which per‐
     form tasks such as quoting or emphasizing pieces of text.  The manual
     domain is defined as macros that are a subset of the day to day infor‐
     mal language used to describe commands, routines and related BSD files.
     Macros in the manual domain handle command names, command-line argu‐
     ments and options, function names, function parameters, pathnames,
     variables, cross references to other manual pages, and so on.  These
     domain items have value for both the author and the future user of the
     manual page.  It is hoped the consistency gained across the manual set
     will provide easier translation to future documentation tools.
     Throughout the UNIX manual pages, a manual entry is simply referred to
     as a man page, regardless of actual length and without sexist inten‐
     tion.
