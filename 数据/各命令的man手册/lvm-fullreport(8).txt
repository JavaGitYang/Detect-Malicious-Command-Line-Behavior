       lvm fullreport produces formatted output about PVs, PV segments, VGs,
       LVs and LV segments. The information is all gathered together for
       each VG (under a per-VG lock) so it is consistent. Information
       gathered from separate calls to vgs, pvs, and lvs can be inconsistent
       if information changes between commands.
