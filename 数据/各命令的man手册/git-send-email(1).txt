       Takes the patches given on the command line and emails them out.
       Patches can be specified as files, directories (which will send all
       files in the directory), or directly as a revision list. In the last
       case, any format accepted by git-format-patch(1) can be passed to git
       send-email.
       The header of the email is configurable via command-line options. If
       not specified on the command line, the user will be prompted with a
       ReadLine enabled interface to provide the necessary information.
       There are two formats accepted for patch files:
        1. mbox format files
           This is what git-format-patch(1) generates. Most headers and MIME
           formatting are ignored.
        2. The original format used by Greg Kroah-Hartmanâ€™s
           send_lots_of_email.pl script
           This format expects the first line of the file to contain the
           "Cc:" value and the "Subject:" of the message as the second line.
