       This function will return information about the PKCS11 certificate
       such as the label, id as well as token information where the key is
       stored. When output is text it returns null terminated string
       although  output_size contains the size of the actual data only.
       In versions previously to 3.6.0 this function included the null
       terminator to  output_size . After 3.6.0 the output size doesn't
       include the terminator character.
