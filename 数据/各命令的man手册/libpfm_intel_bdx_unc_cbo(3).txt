       The library supports the Intel Broadwell Server C-Box (coherency
       engine) uncore PMU.  This PMU model exists on various Broadwell
       server models (79, 86) . There is one C-box PMU per physical core.
       Therefore there are up to twenty-one identical C-Box PMU instances
       numbered from 0 to 21. On dual-socket systems, the number refers to
       the C-Box PMU on the socket where the program runs. For instance, if
       running on CPU18, then bdx_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical
       core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if running on CPU0, then the same
       bdx_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 but on socket 0.
       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter registers
       used only with certain events and umasks.
