       This function will convert the given data to printable data, using
       the base64 encoding.  This is the encoding used in PEM messages.
       This function will allocate the required memory to hold the encoded
       data.
       You should use gnutls_free() to free the returned data.
       Note, that prior to GnuTLS 3.4.0 this function was available under
       the name gnutls_pem_base64_encode_alloc(). There is compatibility
       macro pointing to this function.
