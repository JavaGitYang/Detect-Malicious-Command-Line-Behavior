       The wcsftime() function shall be equivalent to the strftime()
       function, except that:
        *  The argument wcs points to the initial element of an array of
           wide characters into which the generated output is to be placed.
        *  The argument maxsize indicates the maximum number of wide
           characters to be placed in the output array.
        *  The argument format is a wide-character string and the conversion
           specifications are replaced by corresponding sequences of wide
           characters.
        *  The return value indicates the number of wide characters placed
           in the output array.
       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.
