       This application is a CVS emulation layer for Git.
       It is highly functional. However, not all methods are implemented,
       and for those methods that are implemented, not all switches are
       implemented.
       Testing has been done using both the CLI CVS client, and the Eclipse
       CVS plugin. Most functionality works fine with both of these clients.
