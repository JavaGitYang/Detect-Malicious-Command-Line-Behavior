       pmdasample is a sample Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports a variety of synthetic performance metrics.
       This PMDA was developed as part of the quality assurance testing for
       the PCP product, but has other uses, most notably in the development
       of new PCP clients.
       The metrics exported by the sample PMDA cover the full range of data
       types, data semantics, value cardinality, instance domain stability
       and error conditions found in real PMDAs.
       A brief description of the pmdasample command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -i   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the specified TCP/IP
            port.  port may be a port number or port name.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            sample.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdasample is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
            standard error instead.
       -p   Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to pmdasample is
            via standard input and standard output.  This is the default
            connection mode.
       -u   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasample on the Unix domain socket
            named socket.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
       At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be specified.
