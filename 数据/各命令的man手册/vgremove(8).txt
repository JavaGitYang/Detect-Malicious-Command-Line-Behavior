       vgremove removes one or more VGs. If LVs exist in the VG, a prompt is
       used to confirm LV removal.
       If one or more PVs in the VG are lost, consider vgreduce
       --removemissing to make the VG metadata consistent again.
       Repeat the force option (-ff) to forcibly remove LVs in the VG
       without confirmation.
