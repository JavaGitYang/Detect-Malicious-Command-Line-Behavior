       This function returns a string which describes the libpfm error value
       in code. The string returned by the call is read-only.
       The function must only be used with libpfm calls documented to return
       specific error codes. The value -1 is not considered a specific error
       code.  Strings and pfm_pmu_t return values cannot be used with this
       function.  Typically NULL is returned in case of error for string
       values, and PFM_PMU_NONE is returned for pfm_pmu_t values.
       The function is also not designed to handle OS system call errors,
       i.e., errno values.
