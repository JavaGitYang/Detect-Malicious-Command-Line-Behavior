       The lines of the configuration file have the following syntax:
       <user>[:<option>:<option>...]
       The user can be specified in the following manner:
       ·   a username
       ·   a groupname, with @group syntax. This should not be confused with
           netgroups.
       ·   a SELinux user name with %seuser syntax.
       The recognized options are:
       exclusive
           Only single login session will be allowed for the user and the
           user's processes will be killed on logout.
       ignore
           The module will never return PAM_SUCCESS status for the user. It
           will return PAM_IGNORE if SELinux is in the enforcing mode, and
           PAM_AUTH_ERR otherwise. It is useful if you want to support
           passwordless guest users and other confined users with passwords
           simultaneously.
       The lines which start with # character are comments and are ignored.
