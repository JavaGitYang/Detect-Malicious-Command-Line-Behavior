       The /etc/projid file provides a mapping between numeric project
       identifiers and a simple human readable name (similar relationship to
       the one that exists between usernames and uids).  Its format is
       simply:
            # comments are hash-prefixed
            # ...
            cage:10
            logfiles:42
       This file is optional, if a project identifier cannot be mapped to a
       name, it will be parsed and displayed as a numeric value.
