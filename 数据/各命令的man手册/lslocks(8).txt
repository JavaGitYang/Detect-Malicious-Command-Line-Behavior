       lslocks lists information about all the currently held file locks in
       a Linux system.
       Note that lslocks also lists OFD (Open File Description) locks, these
       locks are not associated with any process (PID is -1).  OFD locks are
       associated with the open file description on which they are acquired.
       This lock type is available since Linux 3.15, see fcntl(2) for more
       details.
