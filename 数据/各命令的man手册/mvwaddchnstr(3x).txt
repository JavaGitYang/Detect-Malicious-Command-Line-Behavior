       These functions copy the (null-terminated) chstr array into the
       window image structure starting at the current cursor position.  The
       four functions with n as the last argument copy at most n elements,
       but no more than will fit on the line.  If n=-1 then the whole array
       is copied, to the maximum number of characters that will fit on the
       line.
       The window cursor is not advanced.  These functions work faster than
       waddnstr.  On the other hand:
       路   they do not perform checking (such as for the newline, backspace,
           or carriage return characters),
       路   they do not advance the current cursor position,
       路   they do not expand other control characters to ^-escapes, and
       路   they truncate the string if it crosses the right margin, rather
           than wrapping it around to the new line.
