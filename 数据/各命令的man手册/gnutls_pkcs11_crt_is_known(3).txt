       This function will check whether the provided certificate is stored
       in the specified token. This is useful in combination with
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_TRUSTED or
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED, to check whether a CA is
       present or a certificate is blacklisted in a trust PKCS 11 module.
       This function can be used with a  url of "pkcs11:", and in that case
       all modules will be searched. To restrict the modules to the marked
       as trusted in p11-kit use the
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE flag.
       Note that the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_DISTRUSTED is
       specific to p11-kit trust modules.
