       mysql_setpermission is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets permissions in the
       MariaDB grant tables.  mysql_setpermission is written in Perl and
       requires that the DBI and DBD::mysql Perl modules be installed.
       Invoke mysql_setpermission like this:
           shell> mysql_setpermission [options]
       options should be either --help to display the help message, or
       options that indicate how to connect to the MariaDB server. The
       account used when you connect determines which permissions you have
       when attempting to modify existing permissions in the grant tables.
       mysql_setpermission also reads options from the [client] and [perl]
       groups in the .my.cnf file in your home directory, if the file
       exists.
       mysql_setpermission supports the following options:
       ·   --help
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --host=host_name
           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.
       ·   --password=password
           The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that the
           password value is not optional for this option, unlike for other
           MariaDB programs.
           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.
       ·   --port=port_num
           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
       ·   --socket=path
           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.
       ·   --user=user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
