       getgroups() returns the supplementary group IDs of the calling
       process in list.  The argument size should be set to the maximum
       number of items that can be stored in the buffer pointed to by list.
       If the calling process is a member of more than size supplementary
       groups, then an error results.  It is unspecified whether the
       effective group ID of the calling process is included in the returned
       list.  (Thus, an application should also call getegid(2) and add or
       remove the resulting value.)
       If size is zero, list is not modified, but the total number of
       supplementary group IDs for the process is returned.  This allows the
       caller to determine the size of a dynamically allocated list to be
       used in a further call to getgroups().
       setgroups() sets the supplementary group IDs for the calling process.
       Appropriate privileges are required (see the description of the EPERM
       error, below).  The size argument specifies the number of
       supplementary group IDs in the buffer pointed to by list.
