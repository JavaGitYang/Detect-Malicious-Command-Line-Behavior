       The asyncmeta backend to slapd(8) performs basic LDAP proxying with
       respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets".  The
       information contained in these servers can be presented as belonging
       to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).
       A good knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-meta(5) backend
       is recommended.   This  backend has been designed as an asynchronous
       version of the meta backend. Unlike meta , the operation handling
       threads are no longer pending on the response from the remote server,
       thus decreasing the number of threads necessary to handle the same
       load. While asyncmeta maintains the functionality of meta and has a
       largely similar codebase, some changes in operation and some new
       configuration directives have been added. Some configuration options,
       such as conn-ttl, single-conn and use-temporary-conn have been
       removed, as they are no longer relevant.
       New connection handling:
       Unlike meta, which caches bound connections, the asyncmeta works with
       a configured maximum number of connections per target.  For each
       request redirected to a target, a different connection is selected.
       Each connection has a queue, to which the request is added before it
       is sent to the remote server, and is removed after the last response
       for that request is received.
        For each new request, the connection with the smallest number of
       pending requests is selected, or using round-robin if the numbers are
       equal.
       Overlays:
       Due to implementation specifics, there is no guarantee that any of
       the existing OpenLDAP overlays will work with asyncmeta backend.
