       yum-builddep is a program which installs the RPMs needed to build the
       specified package.  The source RPM for the specified package must be
       available in a Yum repository (which will be automatically enabled,
       if it is disabled) or it can be a local source RPM or a spec file.
       Note, that only the BuildRequires information within the SRPM header
       information is used to determine build dependencies. This will
       specifically omit any dependencies that are required only for
       specific architectures.
