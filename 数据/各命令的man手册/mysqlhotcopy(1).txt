       mysqlhotcopy is a Perl script that was originally written and
       contributed by Tim Bunce. It uses FLUSH TABLES, LOCK TABLES, and cp
       or scp to make a database backup. It is a fast way to make a backup
       of the database or single tables, but it can be run only on the same
       machine where the database directories are located.  mysqlhotcopy
       works only for backing up MyISAM and ARCHIVE tables. It runs on Unix
       and NetWare.
       To use mysqlhotcopy, you must have read access to the files for the
       tables that you are backing up, the SELECT privilege for those
       tables, the RELOAD privilege (to be able to execute FLUSH TABLES),
       and the LOCK TABLES privilege (to be able to lock the tables).
           shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name [/path/to/new_directory]
           shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name_1 ... db_name_n /path/to/new_directory
       Back up tables in the given database that match a regular expression:
           shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./regex/
       The regular expression for the table name can be negated by prefixing
       it with a tilde (“~”):
           shell> mysqlhotcopy db_name./~regex/
       mysqlhotcopy supports the following options, which can be specified
       on the command line or in the [mysqlhotcopy] and [client] option file
       groups.
       ·   --help, -?
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --addtodest
           Do not rename target directory (if it exists); merely add files
           to it.
       ·   --allowold
           Do not abort if a target exists; rename it by adding an _old
           suffix.
       ·   --checkpoint=db_name.tbl_name
           Insert checkpoint entries into the specified database db_name and
           table tbl_name.
       ·   --chroot=path
           Base directory of the chroot jail in which mysqld operates. The
           path value should match that of the --chroot option given to
           mysqld.
       ·   --debug
           Enable debug output.
       ·   --dryrun, -n
           Report actions without performing them.
       ·   --flushlog
           Flush logs after all tables are locked.
       ·   --host=host_name, -h host_name
           The host name of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP
           connection to the local server. By default, the connection is
           made to localhost using a Unix socket file.
       ·   --keepold
           Do not delete previous (renamed) target when done.
       ·   --method=command
           The method for copying files (cp or scp). The default is cp.
       ·   --noindices
           Do not include full index files for MyISAM tables in the backup.
           This makes the backup smaller and faster. The indexes for
           reloaded tables can be reconstructed later with myisamchk -rq.
       ·   --old-server
           Connect to old MySQL-server (before v5.5) which doesn't have
           FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK fully implemented..
       ·   --password=password, -ppassword
           The password to use when connecting to the server. The password
           value is not optional for this option, unlike for other MariaDB
           programs.
           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.
       ·   --port=port_num, -P port_num
           The TCP/IP port number to use when connecting to the local
           server.
       ·   --quiet, -q
           Be silent except for errors.
       ·   --record_log_pos=db_name.tbl_name
           Record master and slave status in the specified database db_name
           and table tbl_name.
       ·   --regexp=expr
           Copy all databases with names that match the given regular
           expression.
       ·   --resetmaster
           Reset the binary log after locking all the tables.
       ·   --resetslave
           Reset the master.info file after locking all the tables.
       ·   --socket=path, -S path
           The Unix socket file to use for connections to localhost.
       ·   --suffix=str
           The suffix to use for names of copied databases.
       ·   --tmpdir=path
           The temporary directory. The default is /tmp.
       ·   --user=user_name, -u user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
       Use perldoc for additional mysqlhotcopy documentation, including
       information about the structure of the tables needed for the
       --checkpoint and --record_log_pos options:
           shell> perldoc mysqlhotcopy
