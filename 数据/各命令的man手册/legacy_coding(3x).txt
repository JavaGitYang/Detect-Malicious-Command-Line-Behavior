       The use_legacy_coding function is an extension to the curses library.
       It allows the caller to change the result of unctrl, and suppress
       related checks within the library that would normally cause
       nonprinting characters to be rendered in visible form.  This affects
       only 8-bit characters.
       The level parameter controls the result:
              0    the library functions normally, rendering nonprinting
                   characters as described in unctrl.
              1    the library ignores isprintf for codes in the range
                   160-255.
              2    the library ignores isprintf for codes in the range
                   128-255.  It also modifies the output of unctrl, showing
                   codes in the range 128-159 as is.
