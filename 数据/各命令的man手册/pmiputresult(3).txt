       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiPutResult provides an interface for developers
       familiar with the internal PCP data structures to create output
       archives directly.
       By building the pmResult data structure directly, then calling
       pmiPutResult the developer avoids calls to pmiPutValue(3) and/or
       pmiPutValueHandle(3) followed by a call to pmiWrite(3) for each
       record written to the archive.
       Any metrics and instances appearing in the result must have been
       defined by prior calls to pmiAddMetric(3) and pmiAddInstance(3).
       pmiPutResult will arrange for any new metadata (metrics and/or
       instance domain changes) covered by result to be also written to the
       PCP archive.
       Because of the complexity of the pmResult data structure, this
       routine is not available in the Perl interface to the LOGIMPORT
       services.
