       Print the SHA1 value of a Git id (defaulting to HEAD). In addition to
       the standard Git idâ€™s like heads and tags, this command also accepts
       [<branch>:]<patch> for the id of a patch, [<branch>:]{base} for the
       base of the stack and [<branch>:]{public} for the public branch
       corresponding to the stack (see the publish command for details). If
       no branch is specified, it defaults to the current one. The bottom of
       a patch is accessible with the [<branch>:]<patch>^ format.
