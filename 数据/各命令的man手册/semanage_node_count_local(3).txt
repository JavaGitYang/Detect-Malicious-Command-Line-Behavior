       Behavior:
              The count function will return the number of all objects in
              the selected location.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The number of objects will be
              stored at the location poined by response.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) )
