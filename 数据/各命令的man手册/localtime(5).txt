       The /etc/localtime file configures the system-wide timezone of the
       local system that is used by applications for presentation to the
       user. It should be an absolute or relative symbolic link pointing to
       /usr/share/zoneinfo/, followed by a timezone identifier such as
       "Europe/Berlin" or "Etc/UTC". The resulting link should lead to the
       corresponding binary tzfile(5) timezone data for the configured
       timezone.
       Because the timezone identifier is extracted from the symlink target
       name of /etc/localtime, this file may not be a normal file or
       hardlink.
       The timezone may be overridden for individual programs by using the
       $TZ environment variable. See environ(7).
       You may use timedatectl(1) to change the settings of this file from
       the command line during runtime. Use systemd-firstboot(1) to
       initialize the time zone on mounted (but not booted) system images.
