       smartpqi is a SCSI driver for Microsemi Smart Family controllers.
   Supported ioctl() operations
       For compatibility with applications written for the cciss(4) and
       hpsa(4) drivers, many, but not all of the ioctl(2) operations
       supported by the hpsa driver are also supported by the smartpqi
       driver.  The data structures used by these operations are described
       in the Linux kernel source file include/linux/cciss_ioctl.h.
       CCISS_DEREGDISK, CCISS_REGNEWDISK, CCISS_REGNEWD
              These operations all do exactly the same thing, which is to
              cause the driver to re-scan for new devices.  This does
              exactly the same thing as writing to the smartpqi-specific
              host rescan attribute.
       CCISS_GETPCIINFO
              This operation Returns the PCI domain, bus, device and
              function and "board ID" (PCI subsystem ID).
       CCISS_GETDRIVVER
              This operation returns the driver version in four bytes,
              encoded as:
                  (major_version << 28) | (minor_version << 24) |
                          (release << 16) | revision
       CCISS_PASSTHRU
              Allows BMIC and CISS commands to be passed through to the con‐
              troller.
   Boot options
       disable_device_id_wildcards={0|1}
              Disables support for device ID wildcards.  The default value
              is 0.
       disable_heartbeat={0|1}
              Disables support for the controller's heartbeat check.  This
              parameter is used for debugging purposes.  The default value
              is 0, leaving the controller's heartbeat check active.
       disable_ctrl_shutdown={0|1}
              Disables support for shutting down the controller in the event
              of a controller lockup.  The default value is 0.
       lockup_action={none|reboot|panic}
              Specifies the action the driver takes when a controller lockup
              is detected.  The default action is none.
              parameter   action
