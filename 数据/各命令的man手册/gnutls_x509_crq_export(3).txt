       This function will export the certificate request to a PEM or DER
       encoded PKCS10 structure.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be returned and * output_data_size
       will be updated.
       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN NEW
       CERTIFICATE REQUEST".
