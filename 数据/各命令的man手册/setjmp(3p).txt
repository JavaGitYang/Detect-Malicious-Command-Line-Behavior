       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       A call to setjmp() shall save the calling environment in its env
       argument for later use by longjmp().
       It is unspecified whether setjmp() is a macro or a function. If a
       macro definition is suppressed in order to access an actual function,
       or a program defines an external identifier with the name setjmp, the
       behavior is undefined.
       An application shall ensure that an invocation of setjmp() appears in
       one of the following contexts only:
        *  The entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration
           statement
        *  One operand of a relational or equality operator with the other
           operand an integral constant expression, with the resulting
           expression being the entire controlling expression of a selection
           or iteration statement
        *  The operand of a unary '!'  operator with the resulting
           expression being the entire controlling expression of a selection
           or iteration
        *  The entire expression of an expression statement (possibly cast
           to void)
       If the invocation appears in any other context, the behavior is
       undefined.
