       Stochastic Fair Blue is a classless qdisc to manage congestion based
       on packet loss and link utilization history while trying to prevent
       non-responsive flows (i.e. flows that do not react to congestion
       marking or dropped packets) from impacting performance of responsive
       flows.  Unlike RED, where the marking probability has to be
       configured, BLUE tries to determine the ideal marking probability
       automatically.
