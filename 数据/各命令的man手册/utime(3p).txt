       The utime() function shall set the access and modification times of
       the file named by the path argument.
       If times is a null pointer, the access and modification times of the
       file shall be set to the current time. The effective user ID of the
       process shall match the owner of the file, or the process has write
       permission to the file or has appropriate privileges, to use utime()
       in this manner.
       If times is not a null pointer, times shall be interpreted as a
       pointer to a utimbuf structure and the access and modification times
       shall be set to the values contained in the designated structure.
       Only a process with the effective user ID equal to the user ID of the
       file or a process with appropriate privileges may use utime() this
       way.
       The utimbuf structure is defined in the <utime.h> header. The times
       in the structure utimbuf are measured in seconds since the Epoch.
       Upon successful completion, the utime() function shall mark the last
       file status change timestamp for update; see <sys/stat.h>.
