       For each file given, GNU strings prints the printable character
       sequences that are at least 4 characters long (or the number given
       with the options below) and are followed by an unprintable character.
       Depending upon how the strings program was configured it will default
       to either displaying all the printable sequences that it can find in
       each file, or only those sequences that are in loadable, initialized
       data sections.  If the file type in unrecognizable, or if strings is
       reading from stdin then it will always display all of the printable
       sequences that it can find.
       For backwards compatibility any file that occurs after a command line
       option of just - will also be scanned in full, regardless of the
       presence of any -d option.
       strings is mainly useful for determining the contents of non-text
       files.
