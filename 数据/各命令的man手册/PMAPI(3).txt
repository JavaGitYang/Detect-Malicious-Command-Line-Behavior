       Within the framework of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), client
       applications are developed using the Performance Metrics Application
       Programming Interface (PMAPI) that defines a procedural interface
       with services suited to the development of applications with a
       particular interest in performance metrics.
       This description presents an overview of the PMAPI and the context in
       which PMAPI applications are run.  The PMAPI is more fully described
       in the Performance Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide, and the manual pages
       for the individual PMAPI routines.
