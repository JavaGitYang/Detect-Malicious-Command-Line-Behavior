       The sem_timedwait() function shall lock the semaphore referenced by
       sem as in the sem_wait() function. However, if the semaphore cannot
       be locked without waiting for another process or thread to unlock the
       semaphore by performing a sem_post() function, this wait shall be
       terminated when the specified timeout expires.
       The timeout shall expire when the absolute time specified by abstime
       passes, as measured by the clock on which timeouts are based (that
       is, when the value of that clock equals or exceeds abstime), or if
       the absolute time specified by abstime has already been passed at the
       time of the call.
       The timeout shall be based on the CLOCK_REALTIME clock.  The
       resolution of the timeout shall be the resolution of the clock on
       which it is based. The timespec data type is defined as a structure
       in the <time.h> header.
       Under no circumstance shall the function fail with a timeout if the
       semaphore can be locked immediately. The validity of the abstime need
       not be checked if the semaphore can be locked immediately.
