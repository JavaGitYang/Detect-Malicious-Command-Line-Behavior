       modules.dep.bin is a binary file generated by depmod listing the
       dependencies for every module in the directories under
       /lib/modules/version. It is used by kmod tools such as modprobe and
       libkmod.
       Its text counterpar is located in the same directory with the name
       modules.dep. The text version is maintained only for easy of reading
       by humans and is in no way used by any kmod tool.
       These files are not intended for editing or use by any additional
       utilities as their format is subject to change in the future. You
       should use the modinfo(8) command to obtain information about modules
       in a future proof and compatible fashion rather than touching these
       files.
