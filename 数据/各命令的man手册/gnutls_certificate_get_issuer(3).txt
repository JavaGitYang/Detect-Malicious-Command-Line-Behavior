       This function will return the issuer of a given certificate.  If the
       flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is specified a copy of the issuer will be
       returned which must be freed using gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().  In that
       case the provided  issuer must not be initialized.
       As with gnutls_x509_trust_list_get_issuer() this function requires
       the GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY flag in order to operate with PKCS11 trust
       lists in a thread-safe way.
