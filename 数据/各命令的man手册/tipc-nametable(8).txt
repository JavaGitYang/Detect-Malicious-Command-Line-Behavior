       The nametable shows TIPC publication information.
   Nametable format
       Type
              The 32-bit type field of the port name. The type field often
              indicates the class of service provided by a port.
       Lower
              The lower bound of the 32-bit instance field of the port name.
              The instance field is often used as as a sub-class indicator.
       Upper
              The upper bound of the 32-bit instance field of the port name.
              The instance field is often used as as a sub-class indicator.
              A difference in lower and upper means the socket is bound to
              the port name range [lower,upper]
       Port Identity
              The unique socket (port) identifier within the TIPC cluster.
              The port identity consists of a node identity followed by a
              socket reference number.
       Publication
              The publication ID is a random number used internally to
              represent a publication.
       Scope
              The publication scope specifies the visibility of a bound port
              name.  The scope can be specified to comprise three different
              domains: node, cluster and zone.  Applications residing within
              the specified scope can see and access the port using the
              displayed port name.
