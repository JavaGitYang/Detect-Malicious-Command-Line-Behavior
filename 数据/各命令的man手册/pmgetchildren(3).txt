       Given a fully qualified pathname to a node in the current Performance
       Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as identified by name, pmGetChildren
       returns via offspring a list of the relative names of all of the
       immediate descendent nodes of name in the current PMNS.
       As a special case, if name is an empty string (i.e.""), the immediate
       descendants of the root node in the PMNS will be returned.
       Normally, pmGetChildren will return the number of descendent names
       discovered, else a value less than zero for an error.  The value zero
       indicates that name is a valid metric name, i.e. is associated with a
       leaf node in the PMNS.
       The resulting list of pointers offspring and the values (the relative
       names) that the pointers reference will have been allocated by
       pmGetChildren with a single call to malloc(3), and it is the
       responsibility of the pmGetChildren caller to free(offspring) to
       release the space when it is no longer required.
       When an error occurs, or name is a leaf node (i.e. the result of
       pmGetChildren is less than one), offspring is undefined (no space
       will have been allocated, and so calling free(3) is a singularly bad
       idea).
