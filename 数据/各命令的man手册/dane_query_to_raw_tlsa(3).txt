       This function will provide the DANE data from the query response.
       The pointers dane_data and dane_data_len are allocated with
       gnutls_malloc() to contain the data from the query result structure
       (individual
        dane_data items simply point to the original data and are not
       allocated separately).  The returned  dane_data are only valid during
       the lifetime of  q .
