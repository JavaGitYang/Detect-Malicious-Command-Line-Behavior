       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fputc() function shall write the byte specified by c (converted
       to an unsigned char) to the output stream pointed to by stream, at
       the position indicated by the associated file-position indicator for
       the stream (if defined), and shall advance the indicator
       appropriately.  If the file cannot support positioning requests, or
       if the stream was opened with append mode, the byte shall be appended
       to the output stream.
       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution
       of fputc() and the next successful completion of a call to fflush()
       or fclose() on the same stream or a call to exit() or abort().
