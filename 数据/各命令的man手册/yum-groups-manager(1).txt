       yum-groups-manager is used to create or edit a group metadata file
       for a yum repository. This is often much easier than writing/editing
       the XML by hand.  The yum-groups-manager can load an entire file of
       groups metadata and either create a new group or edit an existing
       group and then write all of the groups metadata back out.
