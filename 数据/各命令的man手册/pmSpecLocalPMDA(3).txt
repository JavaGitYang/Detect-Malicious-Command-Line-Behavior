       For Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) applications, contexts of type
       PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL are used by clients that wish to fetch metrics
       directly from one or more PMDAs on the local host without involving
       pmcd(1).
       pmSpecLocalPMDA provides a convenience wrapper to be used by
       applications that wish to use a command line argument (usually with
       -K) to control the DSO PMDAs that are available for a
       PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL context.
       The spec argument specifies actions for one or more DSO PMDAs using
       up to four fields separated by commas (``,''), namely:
       -  an opcode with one of the values add (add a new entry), del
          (delete an existing entry) or clear (clear all entries from the
          table).
       -  the PMDA's domain number
       -  the path to the PMDA DSO (may be absolute or relative to the
          $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmdas directory and the DSO suffix is optional), and
       -  the name of the PMDA's initialization routine.
       All fields are required to add a new entry.  To delete an entry the
       opcode is required plus either or both of the domain number and path
       fields.  To clear all entries, only the opcode is required.
       If spec is parsed successfully, then the DSO table is updated with
       the extracted fields.
