       mkfs.btrfs is used to create the btrfs filesystem on a single or
       multiple devices. <device> is typically a block device but can be a
       file-backed image as well. Multiple devices are grouped by UUID of
       the filesystem.
       Before mounting such filesystem, the kernel module must know all the
       devices either via preceding execution of btrfs device scan or using
       the device mount option. See section MULTIPLE DEVICES for more
       details.
