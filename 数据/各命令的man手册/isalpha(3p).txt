       For isalpha(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The isalpha() and isalpha_l() functions shall test whether c is a
       character of class alpha in the current locale, or in the locale
       represented by locale, respectively; see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008, Chapter 7, Locale.
       The c argument is an int, the value of which the application shall
       ensure is representable as an unsigned char or equal to the value of
       the macro EOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is
       undefined.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to isalpha_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
