       pmdaRootConnect initializes an IPC channel between a PCP collector
       process - either a PMDA(3) or pmcd(1) itself - and the pmdaroot(1)
       server.
       On success, the return value from pmdaRootConnect is a unix(7) domain
       socket file descriptor, which can be subsequently passed to each of
       the other APIs described here.  This channel can be used to perform
       limited privilege escalation for specific scenarios needed by PCP
       collector services.  The channel can be deactivated using the
       pmdaRootShutdown interface.
