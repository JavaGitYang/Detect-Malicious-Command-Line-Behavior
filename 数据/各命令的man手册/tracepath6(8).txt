       It traces path to destination discovering MTU along this path. It
       uses UDP port port or some random port. It is similar to traceroute,
       only does not require superuser privileges and has no fancy options.
       tracepath6 is good replacement for traceroute6 and classic example of
       application of Linux error queues. The situation with IPv4 is worse,
       because commercial IP routers do not return enough information in
       ICMP error messages. Probably, it will change, when they will be
       updated. For now it uses Van Jacobson's trick, sweeping a range of
       UDP ports to maintain trace history.
