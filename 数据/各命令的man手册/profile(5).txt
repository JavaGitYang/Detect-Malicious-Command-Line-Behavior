       Several command line options can be passed to the program using
       profile files. Firejail chooses the profile file as follows:
       1. If a profile file is provided by the user with --profile option,
       the profile file is loaded.  Example:
              $ firejail --profile=/home/netblue/icecat.profile icecat
              Reading profile /home/netblue/icecat.profile
              [...]
       2. If a profile file with the same name as the application is present
       in ~/.config/firejail directory or in /etc/firejail, the profile is
       loaded. ~/.config/firejail takes precedence over /etc/firejail.
       Example:
              $ firejail icecat
              Command name #icecat#
              Found icecat profile in /home/netblue/.config/firejail
              directory
              Reading profile /home/netblue/.config/firejail/icecat.profile
              [...]
       3. Use a default.profile file if the sandbox is started by a regular
       user, or a server.profile file if the sandbox is started by root.
       Firejail looks for these files in ~/.config/firejail directory,
       followed by /etc/firejail directory.  To disable default profile
       loading, use --noprofile command option. Example:
              $ firejail
              Reading profile /etc/firejail/default.profile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]
              $ firejail --noprofile
              Parent pid 8553, child pid 8554
              Child process initialized
              [...]
