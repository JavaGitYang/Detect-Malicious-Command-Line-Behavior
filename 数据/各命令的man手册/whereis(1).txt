       whereis locates the binary, source and manual files for the specified
       command names.  The supplied names are first stripped of leading
       pathname components and any (single) trailing extension of the form
       .ext (for example: .c) Prefixes of s.  resulting from use of source
       code control are also dealt with.  whereis then attempts to locate
       the desired program in the standard Linux places, and in the places
       specified by $PATH and $MANPATH.
       The search restrictions (options -b, -m and -s) are cumulative and
       apply to the subsequent name patterns on the command line.  Any new
       search restriction resets the search mask.  For example,
              whereis -bm ls tr -m gcc
       searches for "ls" and "tr" binaries and man pages, and for "gcc" man
       pages only.
       The options -B, -M and -S reset search paths for the subsequent name
       patterns.  For example,
              whereis -m ls -M /usr/share/man/man1 -f cal
       searches for "ls" man pages in all default paths, but for "cal" in
       the /usr/share/man/man1 directory only.
