       A QmcMetric object is a container for a single metric and all its
       values.
       The QmcMetricValue structure is used to hold the instance index,
       values and errors of each instance.  In the case of a singular
       metric, a single QmcMetricValue object is used.
       A QmcMetric object consists of a list of QmcMetricValue objects,
       indexes to the descriptors in the metric's QmcGroup and QmcContext
       and flags to indicate if the instances are explicit or implicit, and
       if only active metrics are required after QmcMetric::updateIndom is
       called.
