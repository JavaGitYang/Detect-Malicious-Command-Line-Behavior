       openvt will find the first available VT, and run on it the given
       command with the given command options, standard input, output and
       error are directed to that terminal. The current search path ($PATH)
       is used to find the requested command. If no command is specified
       then the environment variable $SHELL is used.
   OPTIONS
       -c, --console=VTNUMBER
              Use the given VT number and not the first available. Note you
              must have write access to the supplied VT for this to work;
       -f, --force
              Force opening a VT without checking whether it is already in
              use;
       -e, --exec
              Directly execute the given command, without forking.  This
              option is meant for use in /etc/inittab;
       -s, --switch
              Switch to the new VT when starting the command. The VT of the
              new command will be made the new current VT;
       -u, --user
              Figure out the owner of the current VT, and run login as that
              user.  Suitable to be called by init. Shouldn't be used with
              -c or -l;
       -l, --login
              Make the command a login shell. A - is prepended to the name
              of the command to be executed;
       -v, --verbose
              Be a bit more verbose;
       -w, --wait
              wait for command to complete. If -w and -s are used together
              then openvt will switch back to the controlling terminal when
              the command completes;
       -V, --version
              print program version and exit;
       -h, --help
              show this text and exit.
       --     end of options to openvt.
