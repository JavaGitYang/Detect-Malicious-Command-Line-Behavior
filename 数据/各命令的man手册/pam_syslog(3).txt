       The pam_syslog function logs messages using syslog(3) and is intended
       for internal use by Linux-PAM and PAM service modules. The priority
       argument is formed by ORing the facility and the level values as
       documented in the syslog(3) manual page.
       The pam_vsyslog function performs the same task as pam_syslog() with
       the difference that it takes a set of arguments which have been
       obtained using the stdarg(3) variable argument list macros.
