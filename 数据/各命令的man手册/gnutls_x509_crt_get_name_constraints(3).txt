       This function will return an intermediate type containing the name
       constraints of the provided CA certificate. That structure can be
       used in combination with gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check() to
       verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.
       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the  nc
       structure is empty this function will behave identically as if the
       flag was not set.  Otherwise if there are elements in the  nc
       structure then the constraints will be merged with the existing
       constraints following RFC5280 p6.1.4 (excluded constraints will be
       appended, permitted will be intersected).
       Note that  nc must be initialized prior to calling this function.
