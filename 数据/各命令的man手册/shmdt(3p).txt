       The shmdt() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.342, Shared Memory
       Object).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with
       the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The shmdt() function detaches the shared memory segment located at
       the address specified by shmaddr from the address space of the
       calling process.
