       The environment.d directories contain a list of "global" environment
       variable assignments for the user environment.
       systemd-environment-d-generator(8) parses them and updates the
       environment exported by the systemd user instance to the services it
       starts.
       It is recommended to use numerical prefixes for file names to
       simplify ordering.
       For backwards compatibility, a symlink to /etc/environment is
       installed, so this file is also parsed.
