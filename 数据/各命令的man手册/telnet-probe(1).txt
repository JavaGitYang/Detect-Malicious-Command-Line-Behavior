       telnet-probe allows the pmdashping(1) daemons to establish
       connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing daemons
       so that response time and service availability information can be
       obtained.
       The required host and port number arguments have the same meaning as
       their telnet(1) equivalents.
       The -c option causes telnet-probe to perform a connect(2) only.  This
       skips the read(2) and write(2) exercise that would otherwise be done
       after connecting (see below).
       The -v option causes telnet-probe to be verbose while operating.
       Once the telnet connection has been established, telnet-probe reads
       from stdin until end-of-file, and writes all the input data to the
       telnet connection.  Next, telnet-probe will read from the telnet
       connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it receives.
       Then telnet-probe exits.
       To operate successfully, the input passed via telnet-probe to the
       remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to
       close the connection when the last line of input has been processed,
       e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port 25.
       By default telnet-probe will not produce any output, unless there is
       an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed (in
       verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero indicating a
       failure.
