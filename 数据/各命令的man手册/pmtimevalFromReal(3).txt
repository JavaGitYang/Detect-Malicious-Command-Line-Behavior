       pmtimevalNow is a platform-independent method that returns the
       current system time since the Epoch in tv.
       pmtimevalInc adds the time in ap to the time in bp and stores the
       result in ap.  Similarly pmtimevalDec subtracts the time in bp from
       the time in ap and stores the result in ap.
       pmtimevalAdd (and pmtimevalSub) add (and subtract) times and return
       the result as a double value.  The time in the ap argument is not
       changed.
       pmtimevalToReal converts the time in tp to an equivalent double
       value.  pmtimevalFromReal provides the reverse conversion, taking the
       time in secs and returning the equivalent time in val.
       pmPrintStamp prints the timestamp from tp on the stream f in the
       local time (as returned by pmLocaltime(3)) in the format
       HH:MM:SS.XXX.  pmPrintHighResStamp performs a similar service, but
       for a struct timespec and reports the timestamp to nanosecond
       precision.
