       This is not the function you are interested in.  Look at readdir(3)
       for the POSIX conforming C library interface.  This page documents
       the bare kernel system call interface, which is superseded by
       getdents(2).
       readdir() reads one old_linux_dirent structure from the directory
       referred to by the file descriptor fd into the buffer pointed to by
       dirp.  The argument count is ignored; at most one old_linux_dirent
       structure is read.
       The old_linux_dirent structure is declared as follows:
           struct old_linux_dirent {
               long  d_ino;              /* inode number */
               off_t d_off;              /* offset to this old_linux_dirent */
               unsigned short d_reclen;  /* length of this d_name */
               char  d_name[NAME_MAX+1]; /* filename (null-terminated) */
           }
       d_ino is an inode number.  d_off is the distance from the start of
       the directory to this old_linux_dirent.  d_reclen is the size of
       d_name, not counting the terminating null byte ('\0').  d_name is a
       null-terminated filename.
