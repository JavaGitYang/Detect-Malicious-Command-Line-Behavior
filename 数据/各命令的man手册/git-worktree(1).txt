       Manage multiple working trees attached to the same repository.
       A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to
       check out more than one branch at a time. With git worktree add a new
       working tree is associated with the repository. This new working tree
       is called a "linked working tree" as opposed to the "main working
       tree" prepared by "git init" or "git clone". A repository has one
       main working tree (if itâ€™s not a bare repository) and zero or more
       linked working trees. When you are done with a linked working tree,
       remove it with git worktree remove.
       If a working tree is deleted without using git worktree remove, then
       its associated administrative files, which reside in the repository
       (see "DETAILS" below), will eventually be removed automatically (see
       gc.worktreePruneExpire in git-config(1)), or you can run git worktree
       prune in the main or any linked working tree to clean up any stale
       administrative files.
       If a linked working tree is stored on a portable device or network
       share which is not always mounted, you can prevent its administrative
       files from being pruned by issuing the git worktree lock command,
       optionally specifying --reason to explain why the working tree is
       locked.
