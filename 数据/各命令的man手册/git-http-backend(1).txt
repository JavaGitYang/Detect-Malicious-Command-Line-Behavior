       A simple CGI program to serve the contents of a Git repository to Git
       clients accessing the repository over http:// and https:// protocols.
       The program supports clients fetching using both the smart HTTP
       protocol and the backwards-compatible dumb HTTP protocol, as well as
       clients pushing using the smart HTTP protocol.
       It verifies that the directory has the magic file
       "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export any Git
       directory that hasnâ€™t explicitly been marked for export this way
       (unless the GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL environmental variable is set).
       By default, only the upload-pack service is enabled, which serves git
       fetch-pack and git ls-remote clients, which are invoked from git
       fetch, git pull, and git clone. If the client is authenticated, the
       receive-pack service is enabled, which serves git send-pack clients,
       which is invoked from git push.
