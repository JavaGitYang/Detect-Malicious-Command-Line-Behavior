       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The vdprintf(), vfprintf(), vprintf(), vsnprintf(), and vsprintf()
       functions shall be equivalent to the  dprintf(), fprintf(), printf(),
       snprintf(), and sprintf() functions respectively, except that instead
       of being called with a variable number of arguments, they are called
       with an argument list as defined by <stdarg.h>.
       These functions shall not invoke the va_end macro. As these functions
       invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap after the return is
       unspecified.
