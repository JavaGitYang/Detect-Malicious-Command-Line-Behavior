       FQ_Codel (Fair Queuing Controlled Delay) is queuing discipline that
       combines Fair Queuing with the CoDel AQM scheme. FQ_Codel uses a
       stochastic model to classify incoming packets into different flows
       and is used to provide a fair share of the bandwidth to all the flows
       using the queue. Each such flow is managed by the CoDel queuing
       discipline. Reordering within a flow is avoided since Codel
       internally uses a FIFO queue.
