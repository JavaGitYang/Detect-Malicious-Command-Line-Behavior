       Assuming the current PMAPI context is associated with a set of
       archive logs, pmGetArchiveEnd will attempt to find the logical end of
       file (after the last complete record in the set of archives), and
       return the last recorded timestamp via tvp.  This timestamp may be
       passed to pmSetMode(3) to reliably position the context at the last
       valid log record, e.g. in preparation for subsequent reading in
       reverse chronological order.
       For archive logs that are not concurrently being written, the
       physical end of file and the logical end of file are co-incident.
       However if an archive log is being written by pmlogger(1) at the same
       time an application is trying to read the archive, the logical end of
       file may be before the physical end of file due to write buffering
       that is not aligned with the logical record boundaries.
       pmGetArchiveEnd returns an error less than zero if the context is
       neither valid, nor associated with a set of archives, or the set of
       archives is seriously corrupted.  Otherwise, the return value is 0 if
       there has been no change of state since the last call, or 1 if the
       logical end of file has advanced since the last call.
       In the absence of an error, the result returned via tvp is well-
       defined.
       pmGetArchiveEnd preserves the positioning state of the log file prior
       to this function call.
