       The listen() function shall mark a connection-mode socket, specified
       by the socket argument, as accepting connections.
       The backlog argument provides a hint to the implementation which the
       implementation shall use to limit the number of outstanding
       connections in the socket's listen queue. Implementations may impose
       a limit on backlog and silently reduce the specified value. Normally,
       a larger backlog argument value shall result in a larger or equal
       length of the listen queue. Implementations shall support values of
       backlog up to SOMAXCONN, defined in <sys/socket.h>.
       The implementation may include incomplete connections in its listen
       queue. The limits on the number of incomplete connections and
       completed connections queued may be different.
       The implementation may have an upper limit on the length of the
       listen queueâ€”either global or per accepting socket. If backlog
       exceeds this limit, the length of the listen queue is set to the
       limit.
       If listen() is called with a backlog argument value that is less than
       0, the function behaves as if it had been called with a backlog
       argument value of 0.
       A backlog argument of 0 may allow the socket to accept connections,
       in which case the length of the listen queue may be set to an
       implementation-defined minimum value.
       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
       privileges to use the listen() function.
