       If no user operand is provided, the id utility shall write the user
       and group IDs and the corresponding user and group names of the
       invoking process to standard output. If the effective and real IDs do
       not match, both shall be written. If multiple groups are supported by
       the underlying system (see the description of {NGROUPS_MAX} in the
       System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008), the supplementary group
       affiliations of the invoking process shall also be written.
       If a user operand is provided and the process has appropriate
       privileges, the user and group IDs of the selected user shall be
       written. In this case, effective IDs shall be assumed to be identical
       to real IDs. If the selected user has more than one allowable group
       membership listed in the group database, these shall be written in
       the same manner as the supplementary groups described in the
       preceding paragraph.
