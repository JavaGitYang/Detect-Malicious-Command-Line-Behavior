       This function is used to encode a name/value pair. This should be
       used on any field being logged that potentially contains a space, a
       double-quote, or a control character. Any value containing those have
       to be specially encoded for the auparse library to correctly handle
       the value. The encoding method is designed to prevent log injection
       attacks where malicious values could cause parsing errors.
       To use this function, pass the name string and value strings on their
       respective arguments. If the value is likely to have a NUL value
       embedded within it, you will need to pass a value length that tells
       in bytes how big the value is. Otherwise, you can pass a 0 for vlen
       and the function will simply use strlen against the value pointer.
       Also be aware that the name of the field will cause auparse to do
       certain things when interpretting the value. If the name is uid, a
       user id value in decimal is expected. Make sure that well known names
       are used for their intended purpose or that there is no chance of
       name collision with something new.
