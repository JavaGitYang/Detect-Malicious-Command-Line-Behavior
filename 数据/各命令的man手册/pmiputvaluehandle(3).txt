       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiPutValueHandle adds a single value to the current
       output record for a given metric and instance, using the handle
       defined by an earlier call to pmiGetHandle(3).
       The value should be in a format consistent with the metric's type as
       defined in the call to pmiAddMetric(3).
       No data will be written until pmiWrite(3) is called, so multiple
       calls to pmiPutValueHandle or pmiPutValue(3) are typically used to
       accumulate data values for several metric-instance pairs before
       calling pmiWrite(3).
