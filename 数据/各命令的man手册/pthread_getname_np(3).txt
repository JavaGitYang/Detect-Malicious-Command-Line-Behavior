       By default, all the threads created using pthread_create() inherit
       the program name.  The pthread_setname_np() function can be used to
       set a unique name for a thread, which can be useful for debugging
       multithreaded applications.  The thread name is a meaningful C
       language string, whose length is restricted to 16 characters,
       including the terminating null byte ('\0').  The thread argument
       specifies the thread whose name is to be changed; name specifies the
       new name.
       The pthread_getname_np() function can be used to retrieve the name of
       the thread.  The thread argument specifies the thread whose name is
       to be retrieved.  The buffer name is used to return the thread name;
       len specifies the number of bytes available in name.  The buffer
       specified by name should be at least 16 characters in length.  The
       returned thread name in the output buffer will be null terminated.
