       These functions shall retrieve information about networks. This
       information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
       accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this
       database is unspecified.
       The setnetent() function shall open and rewind the database. If the
       stayopen argument is non-zero, the connection to the net database
       shall not be closed after each call to getnetent() (either directly,
       or indirectly through one of the other getnet*() functions), and the
       implementation may maintain an open file descriptor to the database.
       The getnetent() function shall read the next entry of the database,
       opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
       The getnetbyaddr() function shall search the database from the
       beginning, and find the first entry for which the address family
       specified by type matches the n_addrtype member and the network
       number net matches the n_net member, opening and closing a connection
       to the database as necessary.  The net argument shall be the network
       number in host byte order.
       The getnetbyname() function shall search the database from the
       beginning and find the first entry for which the network name
       specified by name matches the n_name member, opening and closing a
       connection to the database as necessary.
       The getnetbyaddr(), getnetbyname(), and getnetent() functions shall
       each return a pointer to a netent structure, the members of which
       shall contain the fields of an entry in the network database.
       The endnetent() function shall close the database, releasing any open
       file descriptor.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
