       When flags are zero this function returns non-zero if a valid OCSP
       status response was included in the TLS handshake. That is, an OCSP
       status response which is not too old or superseded. It returns zero
       otherwise.
       When the flag GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL is specified, the function
       returns non-zero if an OCSP status response was included in the
       handshake even if it was invalid. Otherwise, if no OCSP status
       response was included, it returns zero. The GNUTLS_OCSP_SR_IS_AVAIL
       flag was introduced in GnuTLS 3.4.0.
       This is a helper function when needing to decide whether to perform
       an explicit OCSP validity check on the peer's certificate. Should be
       called after any of gnutls_certificate_verify_peers*() are called.
