       The sendmmsg() system call is an extension of sendmsg(2) that allows
       the caller to transmit multiple messages on a socket using a single
       system call.  (This has performance benefits for some applications.)
       The sockfd argument is the file descriptor of the socket on which
       data is to be transmitted.
       The msgvec argument is a pointer to an array of mmsghdr structures.
       The size of this array is specified in vlen.
       The mmsghdr structure is defined in <sys/socket.h> as:
           struct mmsghdr {
               struct msghdr msg_hdr;  /* Message header */
               unsigned int  msg_len;  /* Number of bytes transmitted */
           };
       The msg_hdr field is a msghdr structure, as described in sendmsg(2).
       The msg_len field is used to return the number of bytes sent from the
       message in msg_hdr (i.e., the same as the return value from a single
       sendmsg(2) call).
       The flags argument contains flags ORed together.  The flags are the
       same as for sendmsg(2).
       A blocking sendmmsg() call blocks until vlen messages have been sent.
       A nonblocking call sends as many messages as possible (up to the
       limit specified by vlen) and returns immediately.
       On return from sendmmsg(), the msg_len fields of successive elements
       of msgvec are updated to contain the number of bytes transmitted from
       the corresponding msg_hdr.  The return value of the call indicates
       the number of elements of msgvec that have been updated.
