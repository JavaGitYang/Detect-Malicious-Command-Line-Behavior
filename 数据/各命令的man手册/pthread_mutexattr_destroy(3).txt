       The pthread_mutexattr_init() function initializes the mutex
       attributes object pointed to by attr with default values for all
       attributes defined by the implementation.
       The results of initializing an already initialized mutex attributes
       object are undefined.
       The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function destroys a mutex attribute
       object (making it uninitialized).  Once a mutex attributes object has
       been destroyed, it can be reinitialized with
       pthread_mutexattr_init().
       The results of destroying an uninitialized mutex attributes object
       are undefined.
