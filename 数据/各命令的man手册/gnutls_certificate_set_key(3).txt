       This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called
       more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.  For clients that want to send more than their own end-
       entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert), the full
       certificate chain must be provided in  pcert_list .
       Note that the  key and the elements of  pcert_list will become part
       of the credentials structure and must not be deallocated. They will
       be automatically deallocated when the  res structure is
       deinitialized.
       If that function fails to load the  res structure is at an undefined
       state, it must not be reused to load other keys or certificates.
       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
       negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags()
       it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be
       used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.
