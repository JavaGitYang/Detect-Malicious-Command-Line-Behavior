       manconv converts a manual page from one encoding to another, like
       iconv.  Unlike iconv, it can try multiple possible input encodings in
       sequence.  This is useful for manual pages installed in directories
       without an explicit encoding declaration, since they may be in UTF-8
       or in a legacy character set.
       If an encoding declaration is found on the first line of the manual
       page, that declaration overrides any input encodings specified on
       manconv's command line.  Encoding declarations have the following
       form:
              '\" -*- coding: UTF-8 -*-
       or (if manual page preprocessors are also to be declared):
              '\" t -*- coding: ISO-8859-1 -*-
