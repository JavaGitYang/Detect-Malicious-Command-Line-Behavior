       The mysql-stress-test.pl Perl script performs stress-testing of the
       MariaDB server.
       mysql-stress-test.pl requires a version of Perl that has been built
       with threads support.
       Invoke mysql-stress-test.pl like this:
           shell> mysql-stress-test.pl [options]
       mysql-stress-test.pl supports the following options:
       ·   --help
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --abort-on-error=N
           Causes the program to abort if an error with severity less than
           or equal to N was encountered. Set to 1 to abort on any error.
       ·   --check-tests-file
           Periodically check the file that lists the tests to be run. If it
           has been modified, reread the file. This can be useful if you
           update the list of tests to be run during a stress test.
       ·   --cleanup
           Force cleanup of the working directory.
       ·   --log-error-details
           Log error details in the global error log file.
       ·   --loop-count=N
           In sequential test mode, the number of loops to execute before
           exiting.
       ·   --mysqltest=path
           The path name to the mysqltest program.
       ·   --server-database=db_name
           The database to use for the tests. The default is test.
       ·   --server-host=host_name
           The host name of the local host to use for making a TCP/IP
           connection to the local server. By default, the connection is
           made to localhost using a Unix socket file.
       ·   --server-logs-dir=path
           This option is required.  path is the directory where all client
           session logs will be stored. Usually this is the shared directory
           that is associated with the server used for testing.
       ·   --server-password=password
           The password to use when connecting to the server.
       ·   --server-port=port_num
           The TCP/IP port number to use for connecting to the server. The
           default is 3306.
       ·   --server-socket=file_name
           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use. The default is
           /tmp/mysql.sock.
       ·   --server-user=user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server. The
           default is root.
       ·   --sleep-time=N
           The delay in seconds between test executions.
       ·   --stress-basedir=path
           This option is required.  path is the working directory for the
           test run. It is used as the temporary location for result
           tracking during testing.
       ·   --stress-datadir=path
           The directory of data files to be used during testing. The
           default location is the data directory under the location given
           by the --stress-suite-basedir option.
       ·   --stress-init-file[=path]
           file_name is the location of the file that contains the list of
           tests to be run once to initialize the database for the testing.
           If missing, the default file is stress_init.txt in the test suite
           directory.
       ·   --stress-mode=mode
           This option indicates the test order in stress-test mode. The
           mode value is either random to select tests in random order or
           seq to run tests in each thread in the order specified in the
           test list file. The default mode is random.
       ·   --stress-suite-basedir=path
           This option is required.  path is the directory that has the t
           and r subdirectories containing the test case and result files.
           This directory is also the default location of the
           stress-test.txt file that contains the list of tests. (A
           different location can be specified with the --stress-tests-file
           option.)
       ·   --stress-tests-file[=file_name]
           Use this option to run the stress tests.  file_name is the
           location of the file that contains the list of tests. If
           file_name is omitted, the default file is stress-test.txt in the
           stress suite directory. (See --stress-suite-basedir.)
       ·   --suite=suite_name
           Run the named test suite. The default name is main (the regular
           test suite located in the mysql-test directory).
       ·   --test-count=N
           The number of tests to execute before exiting.
       ·   --test-duration=N
           The duration of stress testing in seconds.
       ·   --threads=N
           The number of threads. The default is 1.
       ·   --verbose
           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
