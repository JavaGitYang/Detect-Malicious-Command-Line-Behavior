       The towupper() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       toupper(3) function.  If wc is a lowercase wide character, and there
       exists an uppercase equivalent in the current locale, it returns the
       uppercase equivalent of wc.  In all other cases, wc is returned
       unchanged.
       The towupper_l() function performs the same task, but performs the
       conversion based on the character type information in the locale
       specified by locale.  The behavior of towupper_l() is undefined if
       locale is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE (see
       duplocale(3)) or is not a valid locale object handle.
       The argument wc must be representable as a wchar_t and be a valid
       character in the locale or be the value WEOF.
