       Create a new patch and apply the given GNU diff file (or the standard
       input). By default, the file name is used as the patch name but this
       can be overridden with the --name option. The patch can either be a
       normal file with the description at the top or it can have standard
       mail format, the Subject, From and Date headers being used for
       generating the patch information. The command can also read series
       and mbox files.
       If a patch does not apply cleanly, the failed diff is written to the
       .stgit-failed.patch file and an empty StGIT patch is added to the
       stack.
       The patch description has to be separated from the data with a ---
       line.
