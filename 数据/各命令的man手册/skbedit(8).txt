       The skbedit action allows to change a packet's associated meta data.
       It complements the pedit action, which in turn allows to change parts
       of the packet data itself.
       The most unique feature of skbedit is it's ability to decide over
       which queue of an interface with multiple transmit queues the packet
       is to be sent out. The number of available transmit queues is
       reflected by sysfs entries within /sys/class/net/<interface>/queues
       with name tx-N (where N is the actual queue number).
