       This tutorial explains how to import a new project into Git, make
       changes to it, and share changes with other developers.
       If you are instead primarily interested in using Git to fetch a
       project, for example, to test the latest version, you may prefer to
       start with the first two chapters of The Git Userâ€™s Manual[1].
       First, note that you can get documentation for a command such as git
       log --graph with:
           $ man git-log
       or:
           $ git help log
       With the latter, you can use the manual viewer of your choice; see
       git-help(1) for more information.
       It is a good idea to introduce yourself to Git with your name and
       public email address before doing any operation. The easiest way to
       do so is:
           $ git config --global user.name "Your Name Comes Here"
           $ git config --global user.email you@yourdomain.example.com
