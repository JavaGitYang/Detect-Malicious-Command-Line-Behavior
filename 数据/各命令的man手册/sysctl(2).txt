       Do not use this system call!  See NOTES.
       The _sysctl() call reads and/or writes kernel parameters.  For
       example, the hostname, or the maximum number of open files.  The
       argument has the form
           struct __sysctl_args {
               int    *name;    /* integer vector describing variable */
               int     nlen;    /* length of this vector */
               void   *oldval;  /* 0 or address where to store old value */
               size_t *oldlenp; /* available room for old value,
                                   overwritten by actual size of old value */
               void   *newval;  /* 0 or address of new value */
               size_t  newlen;  /* size of new value */
           };
       This call does a search in a tree structure, possibly resembling a
       directory tree under /proc/sys, and if the requested item is found
       calls some appropriate routine to read or modify the value.
