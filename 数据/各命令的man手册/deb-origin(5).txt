       The files in /usr/local/etc/dpkg/origins can provide information
       about various vendors who are providing Debian packages.
       They contain a number of fields, or comments when the line starts
       with ‘#’.  Each field begins with a tag, such as Vendor or Parent,
       followed by a colon and the body of the field. Fields are delimited
       only by field tags. In other words, field text may be multiple lines
       in length, but the tools will join lines when processing the body of
       the field.
       The file should be named according to the vendor name.  The usual
       convention is to name the vendor file using the vendor name in all
       lowercase, but some variation is permitted.  Namely, spaces are
       mapped to dashes (‘-’), and the file can have the same casing as the
       value in Vendor field, or it can be capitalized.
