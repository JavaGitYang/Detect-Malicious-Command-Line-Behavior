       For wctrans(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wctrans() and wctrans_l() functions are defined for valid
       character mapping names identified in the current locale. The
       charclass is a string identifying a generic character mapping name
       for which codeset-specific information is required. The following
       character mapping names are defined in all locales: tolower and
       toupper.
       These functions shall return a value of type wctrans_t, which can be
       used as the second argument to subsequent calls of towctrans() and
       towctrans_l().
       The wctrans() and wctrans_l() functions shall determine values of
       wctrans_t according to the rules of the coded character set defined
       by character mapping information in the current locale or in the
       locale represented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE).
       The values returned by wctrans() shall be valid until a call to
       setlocale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.
       The values returned by wctrans_l() shall be valid only in calls to
       towctrans_l() with a locale represented by locale with the same
       LC_CTYPE category value.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wctrans_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
