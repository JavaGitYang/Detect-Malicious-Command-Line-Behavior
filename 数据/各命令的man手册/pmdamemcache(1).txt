       This PMDA extracts performance data from memcached, a distributed
       memory caching daemon commonly used to improve web serving
       performance.  A farm of memcached processes over multiple servers can
       be utilised by a single web application, increasing the total
       available object cache size, and decreasing the database load
       associated with smaller cache sizes.  This system is described in
       detail at http://www.danga.com/memcached.
