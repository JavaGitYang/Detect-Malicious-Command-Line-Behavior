       This is an extension to the curses library.  It reallocates storage
       for an ncurses window to adjust its dimensions to the specified
       values.  If either dimension is larger than the current values, the
       window's data is filled with blanks that have the current background
       rendition (as set by wbkgdset) merged into them.
