       The system() library function uses fork(2) to create a child process
       that executes the shell command specified in command using execl(3)
       as follows:
           execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-c", command, (char *) 0);
       system() returns after the command has been completed.
       During execution of the command, SIGCHLD will be blocked, and SIGINT
       and SIGQUIT will be ignored, in the process that calls system()
       (these signals will be handled according to their defaults inside the
       child process that executes command).
       If command is NULL, then system() returns a status indicating whether
       a shell is available on the system.
