       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge C-Box (coherency engine)
       uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Ivy Bridge model 62. There
       is one C-box PMU per physical core. Therefore there are up to fifteen
       identical C-Box PMU instances numbered from 0 to 14. On dual-socket
       systems, the number refers to the C-Box PMU on the socket where the
       program runs. For instance, if running on CPU15, then ivbep_unc_cbo0
       refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if
       running on CPU0, then the same ivbep_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for
       physical core 0 but on socket 0.
       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter registers
       used only with certain events and umasks.
