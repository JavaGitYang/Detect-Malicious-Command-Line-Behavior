       This manual page describes ltrace.conf, a file that describes
       prototypes of functions in binaries for ltrace(1) to use.  Ltrace
       needs this information to display function call arguments.
       Each line of a configuration file describes at most a single item.
       Lines composed entirely of white space are ignored, as are lines
       starting with semicolon or hash characters (comment lines).
       Described items can be either function prototypes, or definitions of
       type aliases.
