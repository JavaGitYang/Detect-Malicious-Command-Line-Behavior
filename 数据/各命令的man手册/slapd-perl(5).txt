       The Perl backend to slapd(8) works by embedding a perl(1) interpreter
       into slapd(8).  Any perl database section of the configuration file
       slapd.conf(5) must then specify what Perl module to use.  Slapd then
       creates a new Perl object that handles all the requests for that
       particular instance of the backend.
       You will need to create a method for each one of the following
       actions:
         * new        # creates a new object,
         * search     # performs the ldap search,
         * compare    # does a compare,
         * modify     # modifies an entry,
         * add        # adds an entry to backend,
         * modrdn     # modifies an entry's rdn,
         * delete     # deletes an ldap entry,
         * config     # module-specific config directives,
         * init       # called after backend is initialized.
       Unless otherwise specified, the methods return the result code which
       will be returned to the client.  Unimplemented actions can just
       return unwillingToPerform (53).
       new    This method is called when the configuration file encounters a
              perlmod line.  The module in that line is then effectively
              `use'd into the perl interpreter, then the new method is
              called to create a new object.  Note that multiple instances
              of that object may be instantiated, as with any perl object.
              The new method receives the class name as argument.
       search This method is called when a search request comes from a
              client.  It arguments are as follows:
                * object reference
                * base DN
                * scope
                * alias dereferencing policy
                * size limit
                * time limit
                * filter string
                * attributes only flag (1 for yes)
                * list of attributes to return (may be empty)
       Return value: (resultcode, ldif-entry, ldif-entry, ...)
       compare
              This method is called when a compare request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * attribute assertion string
       modify This method is called when a modify request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * a list formatted as follows
                  ({ "ADD" | "DELETE" | "REPLACE" },
                   attributetype, value...)...
       add    This method is called when a add request comes from a client.
              Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * entry in string format
       modrdn This method is called when a modrdn request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
                * new rdn
                * delete old dn flag (1 means yes)
       delete This method is called when a delete request comes from a
              client.  Its arguments are as follows.
                * object reference
                * dn
       config This method is called once for each perlModuleConfig line in
              the slapd.conf(5) configuration file.  Its arguments are as
              follows.
                * object reference
                * array of arguments on line
       Return value: nonzero if this is not a valid option.
       init   This method is called after backend is initialized.  Its
              argument is as follows.
                * object reference
       Return value: nonzero if initialization failed.
