       The function set_menu_spacing sets the spacing information for the
       menu.  Its parameter spc_description controls the number of spaces
       between an item name and an item description.  It must not be larger
       than TABSIZE.  The menu system puts in the middle of this spacing
       area the pad character.  The remaining parts are filled with spaces.
       The spc_rows parameter controls the number of rows that are used for
       an item.  It must not be larger than 3.  The menu system inserts the
       blank lines between item rows, these lines will contain the pad
       character in the appropriate positions.  The spc_columns parameter
       controls the number of blanks between columns of items.  It must not
       be larger than TABSIZE.  A value of 0 for all the spacing values
       resets them to the default, which is 1 for all of them.
       The function menu_spacing passes back the spacing info for the menu.
       If a pointer is NULL, this specific info is simply not returned.
