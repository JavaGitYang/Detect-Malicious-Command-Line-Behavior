       The pam_mkhomedir PAM module will create a users home directory if it
       does not exist when the session begins. This allows users to be
       present in central database (such as NIS, kerberos or LDAP) without
       using a distributed file system or pre-creating a large number of
       directories. The skeleton directory (usually /etc/skel/) is used to
       copy default files and also sets a umask for the creation.
       The new users home directory will not be removed after logout of the
       user.
