       pcap_set_timeout() sets the packet buffer timeout that will be used
       on a capture handle when the handle is activated to to_ms, which is
       in units of milliseconds.  (See pcap(3PCAP) for an explanation of the
       packet buffer timeout.)
       The behavior, if the timeout isn't specified, is undefined, as is the
       behavior if the timeout is set to zero or to a negative value.  We
       recommend always setting the timeout to a non-zero value unless
       immediate mode is set, in which case the timeout has no effect.
