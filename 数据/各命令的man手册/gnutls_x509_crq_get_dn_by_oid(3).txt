       This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
       request subject, specified by the given OID. The output will be
       encoded as described in RFC2253. The output string will be ASCII or
       UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.

       Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC2253 -- in hex
       format with a 'using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().
