       This function will create an SRP verifier, as specified in RFC2945.
       The  prime and  generator should be one of the static parameters
       defined in gnutls/gnutls.h or may be generated.
       The verifier will be allocated with @gnutls_malloc() and will be
       stored in
        res using binary format.
