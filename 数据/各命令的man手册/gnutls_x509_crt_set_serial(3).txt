       This function will set the X.509 certificate's serial number.  While
       the serial number is an integer, it is often handled as an opaque
       field by several CAs. For this reason this function accepts any kind
       of data as a serial number. To be consistent with the X.509/PKIX
       specifications the provided  serial should be a big-endian positive
       number (i.e. it's leftmost bit should be zero).
       The size of the serial is restricted to 20 bytes maximum by RFC5280.
       This function allows writing more than 20 bytes but the generated
       certificates in that case may be rejected by other implementations.
