       pdfroff is a wrapper program for the GNU text processing system,
       groff.  It transparently handles the mechanics of multiple pass groff
       processing, when applied to suitably marked up groff source files,
       such that tables of contents and body text are formatted separately,
       and are subsequently combined in the correct order, for final
       publication as a single PDF document.  A further optional “style
       sheet” capability is provided; this allows for the definition of
       content which is required to precede the table of contents, in the
       published document.
       For each invocation of pdfroff, the ultimate groff output stream is
       post-processed by the GhostScript interpreter, to produce a finished
       PDF document.
       pdfroff makes no assumptions about, and imposes no restrictions on,
       the use of any groff macro packages which the user may choose to
       employ, in order to achieve a desired document format; however, it
       does include specific built in support for the pdfmark macro package,
       should the user choose to employ it.  Specifically, if the pdfhref
       macro, defined in the pdfmark.tmac package, is used to define public
       reference marks, or dynamic links to such reference marks, then
       pdfroff performs as many preformatting groff passes as required, up
       to a maximum limit of four, in order to compile a document reference
       dictionary, to resolve references, and to expand the dynamically
       defined content of links.
