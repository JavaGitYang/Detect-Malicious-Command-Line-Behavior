       pmie2col is a simple tool that converts output from pmie(1) into
       regular column format.  Each column is 7 characters wide (by default,
       may be changed with the -w option) with a single space between
       columns.  That single space can be substituted with an alternate
       delimiter using the -d option (this is useful for importing the data
       into a spreadsheet, for example).
       The precision of the tabulated values from pmie can be specified with
       the -p option (default is 2 decimal places).  This option can and
       will override any width setting in order to present the requested
       precision.
       The pmie(1) configuration must follow these rules:
       (1)    Each pmie(1) expression is of the form ``NAME = expr;''.  NAME
              will be used as the column heading, and must contain no white
              space, although special characters can be escaped by enclosing
              NAME in single quotes.
       (2)    The ``expr'' must be a valid pmie(1) expression that produces
              a singular value.
       In addition, pmie(1) must be run with the -v command line option.
       It is also possible to use the -e command line to pmie(1) and output
       lines will be prefixed by a timestamp.
