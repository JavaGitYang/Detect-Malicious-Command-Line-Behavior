       The pthread_condattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The pthread_condattr_setpshared() function shall set the process-
       shared attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to
       permit a condition variable to be operated upon by any thread that
       has access to the memory where the condition variable is allocated,
       even if the condition variable is allocated in memory that is shared
       by multiple processes. If the process-shared attribute is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the condition variable shall only be
       operated upon by threads created within the same process as the
       thread that initialized the condition variable; if threads of
       differing processes attempt to operate on such a condition variable,
       the behavior is undefined. The default value of the attribute is
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_condattr_getpshared() or pthread_condattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized condition variable attributes
       object.
