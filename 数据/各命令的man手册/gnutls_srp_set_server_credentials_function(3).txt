       This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
       SRP credentials.  The callback's function form is:
       int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username,
       gnutls_datum_t *salt, gnutls_datum_t *verifier, gnutls_datum_t
       *generator, gnutls_datum_t *prime);
        username contains the actual username.  The  salt ,  verifier ,
       generator and  prime must be filled in using the gnutls_malloc(). For
       convenience  prime and  generator may also be one of the static
       parameters defined in gnutls.h.
       Initially, the data field is NULL in every gnutls_datum_t structure
       that the callback has to fill in. When the callback is done GnuTLS
       deallocates all of those buffers which are non-NULL, regardless of
       the return value.
       In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, if a
       user does not exist, g and n values should be filled in using a
       random user's parameters. In that case the callback must return the
       special value (1).  See gnutls_srp_set_server_fake_salt_seed too.  If
       this is not required for your application, return a negative number
       from the callback to abort the handshake.
       The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
       callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates an
       error.
