       ul reads the named files (or standard input if none are given) and
       translates occurrences of underscores to the sequence which indicates
       underlining for the terminal in use, as specified by the environment
       variable TERM.  The terminfo database is read to determine the
       appropriate sequences for underlining.  If the terminal is incapable
       of underlining but is capable of a standout mode, then that is used
       instead.  If the terminal can overstrike, or handles underlining
       automatically, ul degenerates to cat(1).  If the terminal cannot
       underline, underlining is ignored.
