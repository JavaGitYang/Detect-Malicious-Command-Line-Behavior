       This helper uses specified file descriptors to connect to a remote
       Git server. This is not meant for end users but for programs and
       scripts calling git fetch, push or archive.
       If only <infd> is given, it is assumed to be a bidirectional socket
       connected to remote Git server (git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or
       git-upload-archive). If both <infd> and <outfd> are given, they are
       assumed to be pipes connected to a remote Git server (<infd> being
       the inbound pipe and <outfd> being the outbound pipe.
       It is assumed that any handshaking procedures have already been
       completed (such as sending service request for git://) before this
       helper is started.
       <anything> can be any string. It is ignored. It is meant for
       providing information to user in the URL in case that URL is
       displayed in some context.
