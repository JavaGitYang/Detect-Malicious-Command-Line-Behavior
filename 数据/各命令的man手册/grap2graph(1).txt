       Reads a grap program as input; produces an image file (by default in
       Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as output.
       For a description of the grap language, see grap(1).
       Your graph specification should not be wrapped with the .G1 and .G2
       macros that normally guard it within groff(1) macros.
       The output image will be a black-on-white graphic clipped to the
       smallest possible bounding box that contains all the black pixels.
       By specifying command-line options to be passed to convert(1) you can
       give it a border, set the background transparent, set the image's
       pixel density, or perform other useful transformations.
       This program uses grap(1), pic(1), groff(1), and the ImageMagick
       convert(1) program.  These programs must be installed on your system
       and accessible on your $PATH for grap2graph to work.
