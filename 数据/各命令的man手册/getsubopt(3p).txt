       The getsubopt() function shall parse suboption arguments in a flag
       argument. Such options often result from the use of getopt().
       The getsubopt() argument optionp is a pointer to a pointer to the
       option argument string. The suboption arguments shall be separated by
       <comma> characters and each may consist of either a single token, or
       a token-value pair separated by an <equals-sign>.
       The keylistp argument shall be a pointer to a vector of strings. The
       end of the vector is identified by a null pointer. Each entry in the
       vector is one of the possible tokens that might be found in *optionp.
       Since <comma> characters delimit suboption arguments in optionp, they
       should not appear in any of the strings pointed to by keylistp.
       Similarly, because an <equals-sign> separates a token from its value,
       the application should not include an <equals-sign> in any of the
       strings pointed to by keylistp.  The getsubopt() function shall not
       modify the keylistp vector.
       The valuep argument is the address of a value string pointer.
       If a <comma> appears in optionp, it shall be interpreted as a
       suboption separator. After <comma> characters have been processed, if
       there are one or more <equals-sign> characters in a suboption string,
       the first <equals-sign> in any suboption string shall be interpreted
       as a separator between a token and a value. Subsequent <equals-sign>
       characters in a suboption string shall be interpreted as part of the
       value.
       If the string at *optionp contains only one suboption argument
       (equivalently, no <comma> characters), getsubopt() shall update
       *optionp to point to the null character at the end of the string.
       Otherwise, it shall isolate the suboption argument by replacing the
       <comma> separator with a null character, and shall update *optionp to
       point to the start of the next suboption argument. If the suboption
       argument has an associated value (equivalently, contains an <equals-
       sign>), getsubopt() shall update *valuep to point to the value's
       first character.  Otherwise, it shall set *valuep to a null pointer.
       The calling application may use this information to determine whether
       the presence or absence of a value for the suboption is an error.
       Additionally, when getsubopt() fails to match the suboption argument
       with a token in the keylistp array, the calling application should
       decide if this is an error, or if the unrecognized option should be
       processed in another way.
