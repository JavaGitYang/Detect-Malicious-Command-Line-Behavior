       getrpcport() returns the port number for version versnum of the RPC
       program prognum running on host and using protocol proto.  It returns
       0 if it cannot contact the portmapper, or if prognum is not
       registered.  If prognum is registered but not with version versnum,
       it will still return a port number (for some version of the program)
       indicating that the program is indeed registered.  The version
       mismatch will be detected upon the first call to the service.
