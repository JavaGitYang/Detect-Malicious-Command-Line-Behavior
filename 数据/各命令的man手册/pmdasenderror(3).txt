       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), this routine allows a PMDA to send an error PDU to PMCD.
       There is presently only one use for this - so the PMDA can inform
       PMCD that it is ready (or not ready) to process requests.
       The protocol details are described in pmcd(1) and PMDA(3), but
       basically if a PMDA starts in the notready state (as may be specified
       in pmcd.conf, see pmcd(1)) then PMCD will not send it any requests
       until the PMDA sends an PM_ERR_PMDAREADY error PDU using this
       function.  This is used by a PMDA that may have a long startup time,
       e.g. to process a large configuration file or similar.
