       The constraint overlay is used to ensure that attribute values match
       some constraints beyond basic LDAP syntax.  Attributes can have
       multiple constraints placed upon them, and all must be satisfied when
       modifying an attribute value under constraint.
       This overlay is intended to be used to force syntactic regularity
       upon certain string represented data which have well known canonical
       forms, like telephone numbers, post codes, FQDNs, etc.
       It constrains only LDAP add, modify and rename commands and only
       seeks to control the add and replace values of modify and rename
       requests.
       No constraints are applied for operations performed with the relax
       control set.
