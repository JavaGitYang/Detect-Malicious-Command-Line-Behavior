       This function will return the name of the given RDN sequence.  The
       name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as described in
       RFC4514.
       When the flag GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT is specified, the output
       format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of
       GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.
