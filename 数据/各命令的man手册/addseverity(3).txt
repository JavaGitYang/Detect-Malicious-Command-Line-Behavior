       This function allows the introduction of new severity classes which
       can be addressed by the severity argument of the fmtmsg(3) function.
       By default, that function knows only how to print messages for
       severity 0-4 (with strings (none), HALT, ERROR, WARNING, INFO).  This
       call attaches the given string s to the given value severity.  If s
       is NULL, the severity class with the numeric value severity is
       removed.  It is not possible to overwrite or remove one of the
       default severity classes.  The severity value must be nonnegative.
