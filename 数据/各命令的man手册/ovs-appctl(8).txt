       Open vSwitch daemons accept certain commands at runtime to control
       their behavior and query their settings.  Every daemon accepts a
       common set of commands documented under COMMON COMMANDS below.  Some
       daemons support additional commands documented in their own manpages.
       ovs-vswitchd in particular accepts a number of additional commands
       documented in ovs-vswitchd(8).
       The ovs-appctl program provides a simple way to invoke these
       commands.  The command to be sent is specified on ovs-appctl's
       command line as non-option arguments.  ovs-appctl sends the command
       and prints the daemon's response on standard output.
       In normal use only a single option is accepted:
       -t target
       --target=target
              Tells ovs-appctl which daemon to contact.
              If target begins with / it must name a Unix domain socket on
              which an Open vSwitch daemon is listening for control channel
              connections.  By default, each daemon listens on a Unix domain
              socket named /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/program.pid.ctl,
              where program is the program's name and pid is its process ID.
              For example, if ovs-vswitchd has PID 123, it would listen on
              /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/ovs-vswitchd.123.ctl.
              Otherwise, ovs-appctl looks for a pidfile, that is, a file
              whose contents are the process ID of a running process as a
              decimal number, named
              /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/target.pid.  (The --pidfile
              option makes an Open vSwitch daemon create a pidfile.)
              ovs-appctl reads the pidfile, then looks for a Unix socket
              named /usr/local/var/run/openvswitch/target.pid.ctl, where pid
              is replaced by the process ID read from the pidfile, and uses
              that file as if it had been specified directly as the target.
              On Windows, target can be an absolute path to a file that
              contains a localhost TCP port on which an Open vSwitch daemon
              is listening for control channel connections. By default, each
              daemon writes the TCP port on which it is listening for
              control connection into the file program.ctl located inside
              the configured OVS_RUNDIR directory. If target is not an
              absolute path, ovs-appctl looks for a file named target.ctl in
              the configured OVS_RUNDIR directory.
              The default target is ovs-vswitchd.
       -T secs
       --timeout=secs
              By default, or with a secs of 0, ovs-appctl waits forever to
              connect to the daemon and receive a response.  This option
              limits runtime to approximately secs seconds.  If the timeout
              expires, ovs-appctl exits with a SIGALRM signal.
