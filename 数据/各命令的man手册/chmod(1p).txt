       The chmod utility shall change any or all of the file mode bits of
       the file named by each file operand in the way specified by the mode
       operand.
       It is implementation-defined whether and how the chmod utility
       affects any alternate or additional file access control mechanism
       (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 4.4, File
       Access Permissions) being used for the specified file.
       Only a process whose effective user ID matches the user ID of the
       file, or a process with appropriate privileges, shall be permitted to
       change the file mode bits of a file.
       Upon successfully changing the file mode bits of a file, the chmod
       utility shall mark for update the last file status change timestamp
       of the file.
