       nice() adds inc to the nice value for the calling thread.  (A higher
       nice value means a low priority.)
       The range of the nice value is +19 (low priority) to -20 (high
       priority).  Attempts to set a nice value outside the range are
       clamped to the range.
       Traditionally, only a privileged process could lower the nice value
       (i.e., set a higher priority).  However, since Linux 2.6.12, an
       unprivileged process can decrease the nice value of a target process
       that has a suitable RLIMIT_NICE soft limit; see getrlimit(2) for
       details.
