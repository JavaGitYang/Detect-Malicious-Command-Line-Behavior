       Within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) run-time libraries the name of
       a running application is maintained to be used in error and
       diagnostic messages.
       The default application name is pcp.
       pmSetProgname may be used to set the application name to program
       after stripping any leading components that begin with the filesystem
       path name separator (``/'' for Unix-like systems).
       It is the callers responsibility to ensure the memory pointed to by
       program remains available for the life of the application.
       Typically, the value passed as program for a C program would be
       argv[0].  If program is NULL, the default application name is
       restored.
       pmGetProgname may be used to return the current application name.
