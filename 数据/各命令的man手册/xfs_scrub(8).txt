       xfs_scrub attempts to check and repair all metadata in a mounted XFS
       filesystem.
       WARNING!  This program is EXPERIMENTAL, which means that its behavior
       and interface could change at any time!
       xfs_scrub asks the kernel to scrub all metadata objects in the
       filesystem.  Metadata records are scanned for obviously bad values
       and then cross-referenced against other metadata.  The goal is to
       establish a reasonable confidence about the consistency of the
       overall filesystem by examining the consistency of individual
       metadata records against the other metadata in the filesystem.
       Damaged metadata can be rebuilt from other metadata if there exists
       redundant data structures which are intact.
       Filesystem corruption and optimization opportunities will be logged
       to the standard error stream.  Enabling verbose mode will increase
       the amount of status information sent to the output.
       If the kernel scrub reports that metadata needs repairs or
       optimizations and the user does not pass -n on the command line, this
       program will ask the kernel to make the repairs and to perform the
       optimizations.  See the sections about optimizations and repairs for
       a list of optimizations and repairs known to this program.  The
       kernel may not support repairing or optimizing the filesystem.  If
       this is the case, the filesystem must be unmounted and xfs_repair(8)
       run on the filesystem to fix the problems.
