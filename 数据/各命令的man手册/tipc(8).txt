       The Transparent Inter-Process Communication (TIPC) protocol offers
       total address transparency between processes which allows
       applications in a clustered computer environment to communicate
       quickly and reliably with each other, regardless of their location
       within the cluster.
       TIPC originated at the telecommunications manufacturer Ericsson. The
       first open source version of TIPC was created in 2000 when Ericsson
       released its first Linux version of TIPC. TIPC was introduced in the
       mainline Linux kernel in 2006 and is now widely used both within and
       outside of Ericsson.
