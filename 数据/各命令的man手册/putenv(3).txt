       The putenv() function adds or changes the value of environment
       variables.  The argument string is of the form name=value.  If name
       does not already exist in the environment, then string is added to
       the environment.  If name does exist, then the value of name in the
       environment is changed to value.  The string pointed to by string
       becomes part of the environment, so altering the string changes the
       environment.
