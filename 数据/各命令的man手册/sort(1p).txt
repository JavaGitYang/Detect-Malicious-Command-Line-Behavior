       The sort utility shall perform one of the following functions:
        1. Sort lines of all the named files together and write the result
           to the specified output.
        2. Merge lines of all the named (presorted) files together and write
           the result to the specified output.
        3. Check that a single input file is correctly presorted.
       Comparisons shall be based on one or more sort keys extracted from
       each line of input (or, if no sort keys are specified, the entire
       line up to, but not including, the terminating <newline>), and shall
       be performed using the collating sequence of the current locale.
