       If the calling process is not already a session leader, setpgrp()
       sets the process group ID of the calling process to the process ID of
       the calling process. If setpgrp() creates a new session, then the new
       session has no controlling terminal.
       The setpgrp() function has no effect when the calling process is a
       session leader.
