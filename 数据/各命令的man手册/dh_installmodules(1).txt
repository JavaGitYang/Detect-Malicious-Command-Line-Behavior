       dh_installmodules is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       registering kernel modules.
       Kernel modules are searched for in the package build directory and if
       found, preinst, postinst and postrm commands are automatically
       generated to run depmod and register the modules when the package is
       installed.  These commands are inserted into the maintainer scripts
       by dh_installdeb(1).
