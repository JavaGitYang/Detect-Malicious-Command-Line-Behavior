       The ngettext, dngettext and dcngettext functions attempt to translate
       a text string into the user's native language, by looking up the
       appropriate plural form of the translation in a message catalog.
       Plural forms are grammatical variants depending on the a number. Some
       languages have two forms, called singular and plural. Other languages
       have three forms, called singular, dual and plural. There are also
       languages with four forms.
       The ngettext, dngettext and dcngettext functions work like the
       gettext, dgettext and dcgettext functions, respectively.
       Additionally, they choose the appropriate plural form, which depends
       on the number n and the language of the message catalog where the
       translation was found.
       In the "C" locale, or if none of the used catalogs contain a
       translation for msgid, the ngettext, dngettext and dcngettext
       functions return msgid if n == 1, or msgid_plural if n != 1.
