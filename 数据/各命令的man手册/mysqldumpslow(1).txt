       The MariaDB slow query log contains information about queries that
       take a long time to execute.  mysqldumpslow parses MariaDB slow query
       log files and prints a summary of their contents.
       Normally, mysqldumpslow groups queries that are similar except for
       the particular values of number and string data values. It
       “abstracts” these values to N and ´S´ when displaying summary output.
       The -a and -n options can be used to modify value abstracting
       behavior.
       Invoke mysqldumpslow like this:
           shell> mysqldumpslow [options] [log_file ...]
       mysqldumpslow supports the following options.
       ·   --help
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   -a
           Do not abstract all numbers to N and strings to ´S´.
       ·   --debug, -d
           Run in debug mode.
       ·   -g pattern
           Consider only queries that match the (grep-style) pattern.
       ·   -h host_name
           Host name of MariaDB server for *-slow.log file name. The value
           can contain a wildcard. The default is * (match all).
       ·   -i name
           Name of server instance (if using mysql.server startup script).
       ·   -l
           Do not subtract lock time from total time.
       ·   -n N
           Abstract numbers with at least N digits within names.
       ·   -r
           Reverse the sort order.
       ·   -s sort_type
           How to sort the output. The value of sort_type should be chosen
           from the following list:
           ·   t, at: Sort by query time or average query time
           ·   l, al: Sort by lock time or average lock time
           ·   s, as: Sort by rows sent or average rows sent
           ·   c: Sort by count
       ·   -t N
           Display only the first N queries in the output.
       ·   --verbose, -v
           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
       Example of usage:
           shell> mysqldumpslow
           Reading mysql slow query log from /usr/local/mysql/data/mysqld51-apple-slow.log
           Count: 1  Time=4.32s (4s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t2 select * from t1
           Count: 3  Time=2.53s (7s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t2 select * from t1 limit N
           Count: 3  Time=2.13s (6s)  Lock=0.00s (0s)  Rows=0.0 (0), root[root]@localhost
            insert into t1 select * from t1
