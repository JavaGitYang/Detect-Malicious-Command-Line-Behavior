       The fseeko() and ftello() functions are identical to fseek(3) and
       ftell(3) (see fseek(3)), respectively, except that the offset
       argument of fseeko() and the return value of ftello() is of type
       off_t instead of long.
       On some architectures, both off_t and long are 32-bit types, but
       defining _FILE_OFFSET_BITS with the value 64 (before including any
       header files) will turn off_t into a 64-bit type.
