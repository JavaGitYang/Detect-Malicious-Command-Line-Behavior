       The pthread_barrierattr_destroy() function shall destroy a barrier
       attributes object. A destroyed attr attributes object can be
       reinitialized using pthread_barrierattr_init(); the results of
       otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
       undefined. An implementation may cause pthread_barrierattr_destroy()
       to set the object referenced by attr to an invalid value.
       The pthread_barrierattr_init() function shall initialize a barrier
       attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.
       If pthread_barrierattr_init() is called specifying an already
       initialized attr attributes object, the results are undefined.
       After a barrier attributes object has been used to initialize one or
       more barriers, any function affecting the attributes object
       (including destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized
       barrier.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_barrierattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized
       barrier attributes object.
