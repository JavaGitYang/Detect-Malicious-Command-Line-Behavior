       The getpwnam() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of the record in the password database (e.g.,
       the local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP) that matches the
       username name.
       The getpwuid() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of the record in the password database that
       matches the user ID uid.
       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:
           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };
       See passwd(5) for more information about these fields.
       The getpwnam_r() and getpwuid_r() functions obtain the same informa‚Äê
       tion as getpwnam() and getpwuid(), but store the retrieved passwd
       structure in the space pointed to by pwd.  The string fields pointed
       to by the members of the passwd structure are stored in the buffer
       buf of size buflen.  A pointer to the result (in case of success) or
       NULL (in case no entry was found or an error occurred) is stored in
       *result.
       The call
           sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX)
       returns either -1, without changing errno, or an initial suggested
       size for buf.  (If this size is too small, the call fails with
       ERANGE, in which case the caller can retry with a larger buffer.)
