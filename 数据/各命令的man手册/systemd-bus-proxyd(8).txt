       systemd-bus-proxyd will proxy D-Bus messages to and from a bus. The
       will be either the system bus or the bus specified with --address
       when that option is given. Messages will be proxied to/from standard
       input and output, or the socket received through socket activation.
       This program can be used to connect a program using classic D-Bus to
       kdbus.
