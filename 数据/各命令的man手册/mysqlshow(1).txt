       The mysqlshow client can be used to quickly see which databases
       exist, their tables, or a table´s columns or indexes.
       mysqlshow provides a command-line interface to several SQL SHOW
       statements. The same information can be obtained by using those
       statements directly. For example, you can issue them from the mysql
       client program.
       Invoke mysqlshow like this:
           shell> mysqlshow [options] [db_name [tbl_name [col_name]]]
       ·   If no database is given, a list of database names is shown.
       ·   If no table is given, all matching tables in the database are
           shown.
       ·   If no column is given, all matching columns and column types in
           the table are shown.
       The output displays only the names of those databases, tables, or
       columns for which you have some privileges.
       If the last argument contains shell or SQL wildcard characters (“*”,
       “?”, “%”, or “_”), only those names that are matched by the wildcard
       are shown. If a database name contains any underscores, those should
       be escaped with a backslash (some Unix shells require two) to get a
       list of the proper tables or columns.  “*” and “?”  characters are
       converted into SQL “%” and “_” wildcard characters. This might cause
       some confusion when you try to display the columns for a table with a
       “_” in the name, because in this case, mysqlshow shows you only the
       table names that match the pattern. This is easily fixed by adding an
       extra “%” last on the command line as a separate argument.
       mysqlshow supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqlshow] and [client] option file
       groups.  mysqlshow also supports the options for processing option
       files described.
       ·   --help, -?
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --character-sets-dir=path, -c path
           The directory where character sets are installed.
       ·   --compress, -C
           Compress all information sent between the client and the server
           if both support compression.
       ·   --count
           Show the number of rows per table. This can be slow for
           non-MyISAM tables.
       ·   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           ´d:t:o,file_name´. The default is ´d:t:o´.
       ·   --debug-check
           Print some debugging information when the program exits.
       ·   --debug-info
           Print debugging information and memory and CPU usage statistics
           when the program exits.
       ·   --default-auth=name
           Default authentication client-side plugin to use.
       ·   --default-character-set=charset_name
           Use charset_name as the default character set.
       ·   --defaults-extra-file=filename
           Set filename as the file to read default options from after the
           global defaults files has been read.  Must be given as first
           option.
       ·   --defaults-file=filename
           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override
           global defaults files.  Must be given as first option.
       ·   --defaults-group-suffix=suffix
           In addition to the groups named on the command line, read groups
           that have the given suffix.
       ·   --host=host_name, -h host_name
           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.
       ·   --keys, -k
           Show table indexes.
       ·   --no-defaults
           Do not read default options from any option file. This must be
           given as the first argument.
       ·   --password[=password], -p[password]
           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the
           option and the password. If you omit the password value following
           the --password or -p option on the command line, mysqlshow
           prompts for one.
           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure. You can use an option file to avoid giving the password
           on the command line.
       ·   --pipe, -W
           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.
       ·   --plugin-dir=dir_name
           Directory for client-side plugins.
       ·   --port=port_num, -P port_num
           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
       ·   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}
           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It
           is useful when the other connection parameters normally would
           cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want.
       ·   --print-defaults
           Print the program argument list and exit.  This must be given as
           the first argument.
       ·   --show-table-type, -t
           Show a column indicating the table type, as in SHOW FULL TABLES.
           The type is BASE TABLE or VIEW.
       ·   --socket=path, -S path
           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.
       ·   --ssl
           Enable SSL for connection (automatically enabled with other
           flags). Disable with --skip-ssl.
       ·   --ssl-ca=name

           CA directory (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-cert=name
           X509 cert in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-cipher=name
           SSL cipher to use (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-key=name
           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-crl=name
           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-crlpath=name
           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-verify-server-cert
           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname used
           when connecting. This option is disabled by default.
       ·   --status, -i
           Display extra information about each table.
       ·   --user=user_name, -u user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
       ·   --verbose, -v
