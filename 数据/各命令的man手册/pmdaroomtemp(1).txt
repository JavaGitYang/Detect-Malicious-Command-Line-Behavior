       pmdaroomtemp is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports the temperature from one or more sensors built using the
       DS2480 and DS1280 chipsets and MicroLAN technology from Dallas
       Semiconductor Corporation.
       The roomtemp PMDA exports metrics that reflect the temperatures from
       one or more of these devices, in both degrees Celcius and Fahrenheit.
       Each metric has one instance for each temperature sensor device.  The
       external instance identifiers are the serial numbers (in hex) of the
       DS1280 chips discovered when the MicroLAN was probed.
       A brief description of the pmdaroomtemp command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            roomtemp.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdaroomtemp is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.
