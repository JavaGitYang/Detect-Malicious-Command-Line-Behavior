       The pthread_spin_lock() function shall lock the spin lock referenced
       by lock.  The calling thread shall acquire the lock if it is not held
       by another thread. Otherwise, the thread shall spin (that is, shall
       not return from the pthread_spin_lock() call) until the lock becomes
       available. The results are undefined if the calling thread holds the
       lock at the time the call is made. The pthread_spin_trylock()
       function shall lock the spin lock referenced by lock if it is not
       held by any thread. Otherwise, the function shall fail.
       The results are undefined if any of these functions is called with an
       uninitialized spin lock.
