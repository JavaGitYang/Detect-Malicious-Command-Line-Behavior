       The system call setfsuid() changes the value of the caller's
       filesystem user IDâ€”the user ID that the Linux kernel uses to check
       for all accesses to the filesystem.  Normally, the value of the
       filesystem user ID will shadow the value of the effective user ID.
       In fact, whenever the effective user ID is changed, the filesystem
       user ID will also be changed to the new value of the effective user
       ID.
       Explicit calls to setfsuid() and setfsgid(2) are usually used only by
       programs such as the Linux NFS server that need to change what user
       and group ID is used for file access without a corresponding change
       in the real and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal
       user IDs for a program such as the NFS server is a security hole that
       can expose it to unwanted signals.  (But see below.)
       setfsuid() will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if
       fsuid matches either the caller's real user ID, effective user ID,
       saved set-user-ID, or current filesystem user ID.
