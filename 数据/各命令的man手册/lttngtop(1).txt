       Lttngtop is a ncurses interface for reading and browsing traces
       recorded by the LTTng tracer and displaying various statistics. As of
       now, the cpu usage, performance counters and per process/file I/O
       bandwidth are displayed. This version currently only supports offline
       traces, but a live version is in alpha and will be available for
       testing soon.
