       These routines are used to step through the continuation references
       in a result chain received from ldap_result(3) or the synchronous
       LDAP search operation routines.
       The ldap_first_reference() routine is used to retrieve the first
       reference message in a result chain.  It takes the result as returned
       by a call to ldap_result(3), ldap_search_s(3) or ldap_search_st(3)
       and returns a pointer to the first reference message in the result
       chain.
       This pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to
       ldap_next_reference() to get the next reference message, the result
       of which should be supplied to the next call to
       ldap_next_reference(), etc.  ldap_next_reference() will return NULL
       when there are no more reference messages.  The reference messages
       returned from these calls are used by ldap_parse_reference(3) to
       extract referrals and controls.
       A count of the number of reference messages in the search result can
       be obtained by calling ldap_count_references().  It can also be used
       to count the number of reference messages remaining in a result
       chain.
