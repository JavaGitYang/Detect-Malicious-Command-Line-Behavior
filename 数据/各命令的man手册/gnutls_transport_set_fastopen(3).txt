       Enables TCP Fast Open (TFO) for the specified TLS client session.
       That means that TCP connection establishment and the transmission of
       the first TLS client hello packet are combined. The peer's address
       must be  specified in  connect_addr and  connect_addrlen , and the
       socket specified by  fd should not be connected.
       TFO only works for TCP sockets of type AF_INET and AF_INET6.  If the
       OS doesn't support TCP fast open this function will result to gnutls
       using connect() transparently during the first write.
