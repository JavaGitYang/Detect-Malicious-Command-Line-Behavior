       audispd-zos-remote is a remote-auditing plugin for the Audit
       subsystem. It should be started by the audispd(8) daemon and will
       forward all incoming audit events, as they happen, to a configured
       z/OS SMF (Service Management Facility) database, through an IBM
       Tivoli Directory Server (ITDS) set for Remote Audit service.  See SMF
       MAPPING section below for more information about the resulting SMF
       record format.
       audispd(8) must be configured to start the plugin. This is done by a
       configuration file usually located at
       /etc/audisp/plugins.d/audispd-zos-remote.conf, but multiple instances
       can be spawned by having multiple configuration files in
       /etc/audisp/plugins.d for the same plugin executable (see
       audispd(8)).
       Each instance needs a configuration file, located by default at
       /etc/audisp/zos-remote.conf.  Check zos-remote.conf(5) for details
       about the plugin configuration.
