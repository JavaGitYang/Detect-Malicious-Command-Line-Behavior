       For iscntrl(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The iscntrl() and iscntrl_l() functions shall test whether c is a
       character of class cntrl in the current locale, or in the locale
       represented by locale, respectively; see the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008, Chapter 7, Locale.
       The c argument is a type int, the value of which the application
       shall ensure is a character representable as an unsigned char or
       equal to the value of the macro EOF. If the argument has any other
       value, the behavior is undefined.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to iscntrl_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
