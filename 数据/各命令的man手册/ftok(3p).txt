       The ftok() function shall return a key based on path and id that is
       usable in subsequent calls to msgget(), semget(), and shmget().  The
       application shall ensure that the path argument is the pathname of an
       existing file that the process is able to stat(), with the exception
       that if stat() would fail with [EOVERFLOW] due to file size, ftok()
       shall still succeed.
       The ftok() function shall return the same key value for all paths
       that name the same file, when called with the same id value, and
       should return different key values when called with different id
       values or with paths that name different files existing on the same
       file system at the same time. It is unspecified whether ftok() shall
       return the same key value when called again after the file named by
       path is removed and recreated with the same name.
       Only the low-order 8-bits of id are significant. The behavior of
       ftok() is unspecified if these bits are 0.
