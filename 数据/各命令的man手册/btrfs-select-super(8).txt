       Destructively overwrite all copies of the superblock with a specified
       copy. This helps in certain cases, for example when write barriers
       were disabled during a power failure and not all superblocks were
       written, or if the primary superblock is damaged, eg. accidentally
       overwritten.
       The filesystem specified by device must not be mounted.
           Note
           Prior to overwriting the primary superblock, please make sure
           that the backup copies are valid!
       To dump a superblock use the btrfs inspect-internal dump-super
       command, or the obsolete command btrfs-show-super.
       Then run the check (in the non-repair mode) using the command btrfs
       check -s where -s specifies the superblock copy to use.
       Superblock copies exist in the following offsets on the device:
       ·   primary: 64KiB (65536)
       ·   1st copy: 64MiB (67108864)
       ·   2nd copy: 256GiB (274877906944)
       A superblock size is 4KiB (4096).
