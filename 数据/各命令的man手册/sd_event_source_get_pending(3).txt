       sd_event_source_get_pending() may be used to determine whether the
       event source object specified as source has seen events but has not
       been dispatched yet (and thus is marked "pending").
       Event source objects initially are not marked pending, when they are
       created with calls such as sd_event_add_io(3), sd_event_add_time(3),
       with the exception of those created with sd_event_add_defer(3) which
       are immediately marked pending, and sd_event_add_exit(3) for which
       the "pending" concept is not defined. For details see the respective
       manual pages.
       In each event loop iteration one event source of those marked pending
       is dispatched, in the order defined by the event source priority, as
       set with sd_event_source_set_priority(3).
       For I/O event sources, as created with sd_event_add_io(3), the call
       sd_event_source_get_io_revents(3) may be used to query the type of
       event pending in more detail.
