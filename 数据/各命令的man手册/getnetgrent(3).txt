       The netgroup is a SunOS invention.  A netgroup database is a list of
       string triples (hostname, username, domainname) or other netgroup
       names.  Any of the elements in a triple can be empty, which means
       that anything matches.  The functions described here allow access to
       the netgroup databases.  The file /etc/nsswitch.conf defines what
       database is searched.
       The setnetgrent() call defines the netgroup that will be searched by
       subsequent getnetgrent() calls.  The getnetgrent() function retrieves
       the next netgroup entry, and returns pointers in host, user, domain.
       A null pointer means that the corresponding entry matches any string.
       The pointers are valid only as long as there is no call to other
       netgroup-related functions.  To avoid this problem you can use the
       GNU function getnetgrent_r() that stores the strings in the supplied
       buffer.  To free all allocated buffers use endnetgrent().
       In most cases you want to check only if the triplet (hostname,
       username, domainname) is a member of a netgroup.  The function
       innetgr() can be used for this without calling the above three
       functions.  Again, a null pointer is a wildcard and matches any
       string.  The function is thread-safe.
