       eject allows removable media (typically a CD-ROM, floppy disk, tape,
       JAZ, ZIP or USB disk) to be ejected under software control.  The
       command can also control some multi-disc CD-ROM changers, the auto-
       eject feature supported by some devices, and close the disc tray of
       some CD-ROM drives.
       The device corresponding to device or mountpoint is ejected.  If no
       name is specified, the default name /dev/cdrom is used.  The device
       may be addressed by device name (e.g. 'sda'), device path (e.g.
       '/dev/sda'), UUID=uuid or LABEL=label tags.
       There are four different methods of ejecting, depending on whether
       the device is a CD-ROM, SCSI device, removable floppy, or tape.  By
       default eject tries all four methods in order until it succeeds.
       If a device partition is specified, the whole-disk device is used.
       If the device or a device partition is currently mounted, it is
       unmounted before ejecting.
