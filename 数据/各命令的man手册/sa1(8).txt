       The sa1 command is a shell procedure variant of the sadc command and
       handles all of the flags and parameters of that command. The sa1
       command collects and stores binary data in the current standard
       system activity daily data file.
       The standard system activity daily data file is named saDD unless
       sadc's option -D is used, in which case its name is saYYYYMMDD, where
       YYYY stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for
       the current day. By default it is located in the /var/log/sa
       directory.
       The interval and count parameters specify that the record should be
       written count times at interval seconds. If no arguments are given to
       sa1 then a single record is written.
       The sa1 command is designed to be started automatically by the cron
       command.
