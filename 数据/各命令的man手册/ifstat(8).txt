       ifstat neatly prints out network interface statistics.  The utility
       keeps records of the previous data displayed in history files and by
       default only shows difference between the last and the current call.
       Location of the history files defaults to /tmp/.ifstat.u$UID but may
       be overridden with the IFSTAT_HISTORY environment variable.
       Similarly, the default location for xstat (extended stats) is
       /tmp/.<xstat name>_ifstat.u$UID.
