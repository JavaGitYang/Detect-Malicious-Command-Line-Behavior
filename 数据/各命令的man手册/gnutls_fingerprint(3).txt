       This function will calculate a fingerprint (actually a hash), of the
       given data.  The result is not printable data.  You should convert it
       to hex, or to something else printable.
       This is the usual way to calculate a fingerprint of an X.509 DER
       encoded certificate.  Note however that the fingerprint of an OpenPGP
       certificate is not just a hash and cannot be calculated with this
       function.
