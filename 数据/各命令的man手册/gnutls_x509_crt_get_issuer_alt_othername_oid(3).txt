       This function will extract the type OID of an otherName Subject
       Alternative Name, contained in the given certificate, and return the
       type as an enumerated element.
       If  oid is null then only the size will be filled. The  oid returned
       will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the
       trailing null.
       This function is only useful if gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name()
       returned GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME.
