       The sysv_signal() function takes the same arguments, and performs the
       same task, as signal(2).
       However sysv_signal() provides the System V unreliable signal
       semantics, that is: a) the disposition of the signal is reset to the
       default when the handler is invoked; b) delivery of further instances
       of the signal is not blocked while the signal handler is executing;
       and c) if the handler interrupts (certain) blocking system calls,
       then the system call is not automatically restarted.
