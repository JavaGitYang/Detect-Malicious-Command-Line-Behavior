       __pmParseTime is designed to encapsulate the interpretation of a time
       point specification in command line switches for use by the PCP
       client tools.
       This function expects to be called with the time point specification
       as string.  If the tool is running against PCP archive(s), you also
       need to supply the start time of the first (only) archive as
       logStart, and the end of the last (only) archive as logEnd.  See
       pmGetArchiveLabel(3) and pmGetArchiveEnd(3) for how to obtain values
       for these parameters.  If the tool is running against a live feed of
       performance data, logStart should be the current time (but could be
       aligned on the next second for example), while logEnd should have its
       tv_sec component set to INT_MAX.
       The rslt structure must be allocated before calling __pmParseTime.
       You also need to set the current PCP reporting time zone to correctly
       reflect the -z and -Z command line parameters before calling
       __pmParseTime.  See pmUseZone(3) and friends for information on how
       this is done.
       If the conversion is successful, __pmParseTime returns 0, and fills
       in rslt with the time value defined by the input parameters.  If the
       argument strings could not be parsed, it returns -1 and a dynamically
       allocated error message string in errMsg.  Be sure to free(3) this
       error message string.
