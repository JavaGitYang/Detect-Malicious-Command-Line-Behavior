       The mq_getattr() function shall obtain status information and
       attributes of the message queue and the open message queue
       description associated with the message queue descriptor.
       The mqdes argument specifies a message queue descriptor.
       The results shall be returned in the mq_attr structure referenced by
       the mqstat argument.
       Upon return, the following members shall have the values associated
       with the open message queue description as set when the message queue
       was opened and as modified by subsequent mq_setattr() calls:
       mq_flags.
       The following attributes of the message queue shall be returned as
       set at message queue creation: mq_maxmsg, mq_msgsize.
       Upon return, the following members within the mq_attr structure
       referenced by the mqstat argument shall be set to the current state
       of the message queue:
       mq_curmsgs
                 The number of messages currently on the queue.
