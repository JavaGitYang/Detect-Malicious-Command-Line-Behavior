       matchpathcon_checkmatches() checks whether any specification has no
       matches and reports them.  The str argument is used as a prefix for
       any warning messages.
       matchpathcon_filespec_add() maintains an association between an inode
       ino and a specification index specind, and checks whether a
       conflicting specification is already associated with the same inode
       (e.g. due to multiple hard links). If so, then it uses the latter of
       the two specifications based on their order in the file context
       configuration. Returns the specification index used or -1 on error.
       matchpathcon_filespec_destroy() destroys any inode associations that
       have been added, e.g. to restart for a new filesystem.
       matchpathcon_filespec_eval() displays statistics on the hash table
       usage for the inode associations.
