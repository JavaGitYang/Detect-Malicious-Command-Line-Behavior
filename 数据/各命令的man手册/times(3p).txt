       The times() function shall fill the tms structure pointed to by
       buffer with time-accounting information. The tms structure is defined
       in <sys/times.h>.
       All times are measured in terms of the number of clock ticks used.
       The times of a terminated child process shall be included in the
       tms_cutime and tms_cstime elements of the parent when wait(),
       waitid(), or waitpid() returns the process ID of this terminated
       child. If a child process has not waited for its children, their
       times shall not be included in its times.
        *  The tms_utime structure member is the CPU time charged for the
           execution of user instructions of the calling process.
        *  The tms_stime structure member is the CPU time charged for
           execution by the system on behalf of the calling process.
        *  The tms_cutime structure member is the sum of the tms_utime and
           tms_cutime times of the child processes.
        *  The tms_cstime structure member is the sum of the tms_stime and
           tms_cstime times of the child processes.
