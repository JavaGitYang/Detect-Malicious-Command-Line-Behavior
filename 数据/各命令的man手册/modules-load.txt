       systemd-modules-load.service(8) reads files from the above
       directories which contain kernel modules to load during boot in a
       static list. Each configuration file is named in the style of
       /etc/modules-load.d/program.conf. Note that it is usually a better
       idea to rely on the automatic module loading by PCI IDs, USB IDs, DMI
       IDs or similar triggers encoded in the kernel modules themselves
       instead of static configuration like this. In fact, most modern
       kernel modules are prepared for automatic loading already.
