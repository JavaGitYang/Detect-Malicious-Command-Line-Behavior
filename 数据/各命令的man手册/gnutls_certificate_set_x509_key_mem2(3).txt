       This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type. This function may be called
       more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.
       Note that the keyUsage (2.5.29.15) PKIX extension in X.509
       certificates is supported. This means that certificates intended for
       signing cannot be used for ciphersuites that require encryption.
       If the certificate and the private key are given in PEM encoding then
       the strings that hold their values must be null terminated.
       The  key may be NULL if you are using a sign callback, see
       gnutls_sign_callback_set().
       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
       negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags()
       it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be
       used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.
