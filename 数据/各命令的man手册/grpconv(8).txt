       The pwconv command creates shadow from passwd and an optionally
       existing shadow.
       The pwunconv command creates passwd from passwd and shadow and then
       removes shadow.
       The grpconv command creates gshadow from group and an optionally
       existing gshadow.
       The grpunconv command creates group from group and gshadow and then
       removes gshadow.
       These four programs all operate on the normal and shadow password and
       group files: /etc/passwd, /etc/group, /etc/shadow, and /etc/gshadow.
       Each program acquires the necessary locks before conversion.  pwconv
       and grpconv are similar. First, entries in the shadowed file which
       don't exist in the main file are removed. Then, shadowed entries
       which don't have `x' as the password in the main file are updated.
       Any missing shadowed entries are added. Finally, passwords in the
       main file are replaced with `x'. These programs can be used for
       initial conversion as well to update the shadowed file if the main
       file is edited by hand.
       pwconv will use the values of PASS_MIN_DAYS, PASS_MAX_DAYS, and
       PASS_WARN_AGE from /etc/login.defs when adding new entries to
       /etc/shadow.
       Likewise pwunconv and grpunconv are similar. Passwords in the main
       file are updated from the shadowed file. Entries which exist in the
       main file but not in the shadowed file are left alone. Finally, the
       shadowed file is removed. Some password aging information is lost by
       pwunconv. It will convert what it can.
