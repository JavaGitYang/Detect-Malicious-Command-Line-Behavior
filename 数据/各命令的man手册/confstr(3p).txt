       The confstr() function shall return configuration-defined string
       values. Its use and purpose are similar to sysconf(), but it is used
       where string values rather than numeric values are returned.
       The name argument represents the system variable to be queried. The
       implementation shall support the following name values, defined in
       <unistd.h>.  It may support others:
       _CS_PATH
       _CS_POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFF32_CFLAGS
       _CS_POSIX_V7_ILP32_OFF32_LDFLAGS

       _CS_POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFF32_LIBS
       _CS_POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_CFLAGS
       _CS_POSIX_V6_ILP32_OFFBIG_LDFLAGS

       If len is not 0, and if name has a configuration-defined value,
       confstr() shall copy that value into the len-byte buffer pointed to
       by buf.  If the string to be returned is longer than len bytes,
       including the terminating null, then confstr() shall truncate the
       string to len−1 bytes and null-terminate the result. The application
       can detect that the string was truncated by comparing the value
       returned by confstr() with len.
       If len is 0 and buf is a null pointer, then confstr() shall still
       return the integer value as defined below, but shall not return a
       string. If len is 0 but buf is not a null pointer, the result is
       unspecified.
       After a call to:
           confstr(_CS_V7_ENV, buf, sizeof(buf))
       the string stored in buf will contain the <space>-separated list of
       variable=value environment variable pairs required by the
       implementation to create a conforming environment, as described in
       the implementations' conformance documentation.
       If the implementation supports the POSIX shell option, the string
       stored in buf after a call to:
           confstr(_CS_PATH, buf, sizeof(buf))
       can be used as a value of the PATH environment variable that accesses
       all of the standard utilities of POSIX.1‐2008, if the return value is
       less than or equal to sizeof(buf).
