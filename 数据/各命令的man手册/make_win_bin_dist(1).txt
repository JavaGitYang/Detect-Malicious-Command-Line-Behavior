       This script is used on Windows after building a MySQL distribution
       from source to create executable programs. It packages the binaries
       and support files into a ZIP archive that can be unpacked at the
       location where you want to install MySQL.
       make_win_bin_dist is a shell script, so you must have Cygwin
       installed to use it.
       This program´s use is subject to change. Currently, you invoke it as
       follows from the root directory of your source distribution:
           shell> make_win_bin_dist [options] package_basename [copy_def ...]
       The package_basename argument provides the basename for the resulting
       ZIP archive. This name will be the name of the directory that results
       from unpacking the archive.
       Because you might want to include files of directories from other
       builds, you can instruct this script do copy them in for you, via
       copy_def arguments, which of which is of the form
       relative_dest_name=source_name.
       Example:
           bin/mysqld-max.exe=../my-max-build/sql/release/mysqld.exe
       If you specify a directory, the entire directory will be copied.
       make_win_bin_dist supports the following options.
       ·   --debug
           Pack the debug binaries and produce an error if they were not
           built.
       ·   --embedded
           Pack the embedded server and produce an error if it was not
           built. The default is to pack it if it was built.
       ·   --exe-suffix=suffix
           Add a suffix to the basename of the mysql binary. For example, a
           suffix of -abc produces a binary named mysqld-abc.exe.
       ·   --no-debug
           Do not pack the debug binaries even if they were built.
       ·   --no-embedded
           Do not pack the embedded server even if it was built.
       ·   --only-debug
           Use this option when the target for this build was Debug, and you
           just want to replace the normal binaries with debug versions
           (that is, do not use separate debug directories).
