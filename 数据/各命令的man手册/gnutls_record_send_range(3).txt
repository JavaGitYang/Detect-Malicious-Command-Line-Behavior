       This function operates like gnutls_record_send() but, while
       gnutls_record_send() adds minimal padding to each TLS record, this
       function uses the TLS extra-padding feature to conceal the real data
       size within the range of lengths provided.  Some TLS sessions do not
       support extra padding (e.g. stream ciphers in standard TLS or SSL3
       sessions). To know whether the current session supports extra
       padding, and hence length hiding, use the
       gnutls_record_can_use_length_hiding() function.
