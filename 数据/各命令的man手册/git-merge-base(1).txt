       git merge-base finds best common ancestor(s) between two commits to
       use in a three-way merge. One common ancestor is better than another
       common ancestor if the latter is an ancestor of the former. A common
       ancestor that does not have any better common ancestor is a best
       common ancestor, i.e. a merge base. Note that there can be more than
       one merge base for a pair of commits.
