       shadow manipulates the contents of the shadow password file,
       /etc/shadow. The structure in the #include file is:
           struct spwd {
                 char          *sp_namp; /* user login name */
                 char          *sp_pwdp; /* encrypted password */
                 long int      sp_lstchg; /* last password change */
                 long int      sp_min; /* days until change allowed. */
                 long int      sp_max; /* days before change required */
                 long int      sp_warn; /* days warning for expiration */
                 long int      sp_inact; /* days before account inactive */
                 long int      sp_expire; /* date when account expires */
                 unsigned long int  sp_flag; /* reserved for future use */
           }
       The meanings of each field are:
       ·   sp_namp - pointer to null-terminated user name
       ·   sp_pwdp - pointer to null-terminated password
       ·   sp_lstchg - days since Jan 1, 1970 password was last changed
       ·   sp_min - days before which password may not be changed
       ·   sp_max - days after which password must be changed
       ·   sp_warn - days before password is to expire that user is warned
           of pending password expiration
       ·   sp_inact - days after password expires that account is considered
           inactive and disabled
       ·   sp_expire - days since Jan 1, 1970 when account will be disabled
       ·   sp_flag - reserved for future use
