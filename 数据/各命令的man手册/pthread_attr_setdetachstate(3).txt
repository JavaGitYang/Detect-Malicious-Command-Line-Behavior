       The pthread_attr_setdetachstate() function sets the detach state
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in detachstate.  The detach state attribute
       determines whether a thread created using the thread attributes
       object attr will be created in a joinable or a detached state.
       The following values may be specified in detachstate:
       PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED
              Threads that are created using attr will be created in a
              detached state.
       PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE
              Threads that are created using attr will be created in a
              joinable state.
       The default setting of the detach state attribute in a newly
       initialized thread attributes object is PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
       The pthread_attr_getdetachstate() returns the detach state attribute
       of the thread attributes object attr in the buffer pointed to by
       detachstate.
