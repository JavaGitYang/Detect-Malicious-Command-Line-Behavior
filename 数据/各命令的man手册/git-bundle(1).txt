       Some workflows require that one or more branches of development on
       one machine be replicated on another machine, but the two machines
       cannot be directly connected, and therefore the interactive Git
       protocols (git, ssh, http) cannot be used. This command provides
       support for git fetch and git pull to operate by packaging objects
       and references in an archive at the originating machine, then
       importing those into another repository using git fetch and git pull
       after moving the archive by some means (e.g., by sneakernet). As no
       direct connection between the repositories exists, the user must
       specify a basis for the bundle that is held by the destination
       repository: the bundle assumes that all objects in the basis are
       already in the destination repository.
