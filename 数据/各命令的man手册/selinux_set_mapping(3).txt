       selinux_set_mapping() establishes a mapping from a user-provided
       ordering of object classes and permissions to the numbers actually
       used by the loaded system policy.  Use of this function is highly
       preferred over the generated constants in the libselinux header
       files, as this method allows the policy's class and permission values
       to change over time.
       After the mapping is established, all libselinux functions that
       operate on class and permission values take the user-provided
       numbers, which are determined as follows:
       The map argument consists of an array of security_class_mapping
       structures, which must be terminated by a structure having a NULL
       name field.  Except for this last structure, the name field should
       refer to the string name of an object class, and the corresponding
       perms field should refer to an array of permission bit names
       terminated by a NULL string.
       The object classes named in the mapping and the bit indexes of each
       set of permission bits named in the mapping are numbered in order
       starting from 1.  These numbers are the values that should be passed
       to subsequent libselinux calls.
