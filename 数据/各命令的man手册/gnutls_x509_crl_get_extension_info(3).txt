       This function will return the requested extension OID in the CRL, and
       the critical flag for it.  The extension OID will be stored as a
       string in the provided buffer.  Use
       gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_data() to extract the data.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *
       sizeof_oid is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned.
