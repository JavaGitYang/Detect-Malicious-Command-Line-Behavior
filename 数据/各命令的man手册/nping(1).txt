       Nping is an open-source tool for network packet generation, response
       analysis and response time measurement. Nping allows users to
       generate network packets of a wide range of protocols, letting them
       tune virtually any field of the protocol headers. While Nping can be
       used as a simple ping utility to detect active hosts, it can also be
       used as a raw packet generator for network stack stress tests, ARP
       poisoning, Denial of Service attacks, route tracing, and other
       purposes.
       Additionally, Nping offers a special mode of operation called the
       "Echo Mode", that lets users see how the generated probes change in
       transit, revealing the differences between the transmitted packets
       and the packets received at the other end. See section "Echo Mode"
       for details.
       The output from Nping is a list of the packets that are being sent
       and received. The level of detail depends on the options used.
       A typical Nping execution is shown in Example 1. The only Nping
       arguments used in this example are -c, to specify the number of times
       to target each host, --tcp to specify TCP Probe Mode, -p 80,433 to
       specify the target ports; and then the two target hostnames.
       Example 1. A representative Nping execution
           # nping -c 1 --tcp -p 80,433 scanme.nmap.org google.com
