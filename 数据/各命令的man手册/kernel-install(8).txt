       kernel-install is used to install and remove kernel and initramfs
       images to and from /boot.
       kernel-install will execute the files located in the directory
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/ and the local administration directory
       /etc/kernel/install.d/. All files are collectively sorted and
       executed in lexical order, regardless of the directory in which they
       live. However, files with identical filenames replace each other.
       Files in /etc/kernel/install.d/ take precedence over files with the
       same name in /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/. This can be used to override
       a system-supplied executables with a local file if needed; a symbolic
       link in /etc/kernel/install.d/ with the same name as an executable in
       /usr/lib/kernel/install.d/, pointing to /dev/null, disables the
       executable entirely. Executables must have the extension ".install";
       other extensions are ignored.
       An executable should return 0 on success. It may also return 77 to
       cause the whole operation to terminate (executables later in lexical
       order will be skipped).
