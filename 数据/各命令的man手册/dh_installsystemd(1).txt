       dh_installsystemd is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       enabling, disabling, starting, stopping and restarting systemd unit
       files.
       In the simple case, it finds all unit files installed by a package
       (e.g.  bacula-fd.service) and enables them. It is not necessary that
       the machine actually runs systemd during package installation time,
       enabling happens on all machines in order to be able to switch from
       sysvinit to systemd and back.
       For only generating blocks for specific service files, you need to
       pass them as arguments, e.g. dh_installsystemd quota.service and
       dh_installsystemd --name=quotarpc quotarpc.service.
