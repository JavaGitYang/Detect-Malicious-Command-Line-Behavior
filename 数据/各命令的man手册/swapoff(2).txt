       swapon() sets the swap area to the file or block device specified by
       path.  swapoff() stops swapping to the file or block device specified
       by path.
       If the SWAP_FLAG_PREFER flag is specified in the swapon() swapflags
       argument, the new swap area will have a higher priority than default.
       The priority is encoded within swapflags as:
           (prio << SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_SHIFT) & SWAP_FLAG_PRIO_MASK
       If the SWAP_FLAG_DISCARD flag is specified in the swapon() swapflags
       argument, freed swap pages will be discarded before they are reused,
       if the swap device supports the discard or trim operation.  (This may
       improve performance on some Solid State Devices, but often it does
       not.)  See also NOTES.
       These functions may be used only by a privileged process (one having
       the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability).
   Priority
       Each swap area has a priority, either high or low.  The default pri‐
       ority is low.  Within the low-priority areas, newer areas are even
       lower priority than older areas.
       All priorities set with swapflags are high-priority, higher than
       default.  They may have any nonnegative value chosen by the caller.
       Higher numbers mean higher priority.
       Swap pages are allocated from areas in priority order, highest prior‐
       ity first.  For areas with different priorities, a higher-priority
       area is exhausted before using a lower-priority area.  If two or more
       areas have the same priority, and it is the highest priority avail‐
       able, pages are allocated on a round-robin basis between them.
       As of Linux 1.3.6, the kernel usually follows these rules, but there
       are exceptions.
