       setreuid() sets real and effective user IDs of the calling process.
       Supplying a value of -1 for either the real or effective user ID
       forces the system to leave that ID unchanged.
       Unprivileged processes may only set the effective user ID to the real
       user ID, the effective user ID, or the saved set-user-ID.
       Unprivileged users may only set the real user ID to the real user ID
       or the effective user ID.
       If the real user ID is set (i.e., ruid is not -1) or the effective
       user ID is set to a value not equal to the previous real user ID, the
       saved set-user-ID will be set to the new effective user ID.
       Completely analogously, setregid() sets real and effective group ID's
       of the calling process, and all of the above holds with "group"
       instead of "user".
