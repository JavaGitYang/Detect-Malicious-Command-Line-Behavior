       Run COMMAND, ignoring hangup signals.
       --help display this help and exit
       --version
              output version information and exit
       If standard input is a terminal, redirect it from an unreadable file.
       If standard output is a terminal, append output to 'nohup.out' if
       possible, '$HOME/nohup.out' otherwise.  If standard error is a
       terminal, redirect it to standard output.  To save output to FILE,
       use 'nohup COMMAND > FILE'.
       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nohup, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's
       documentation for details about the options it supports.
