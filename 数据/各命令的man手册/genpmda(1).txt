       Genpmda is a rapid application development tool for creating new
       Performance Metrics Domain Agents, see PMDA(3).  It provides a very
       easy and efficient way to extend the Performance Co-pilot (PCP) with
       new performance metrics without needing to understand the low level
       details of how PMDAs are constructed.
       Genpmda reads a config file containing an augmented Performance
       Metrics Name Space, see pmns(5), and automatically generates
       virtually all of the source code to implement a fully functional
       PMDA, including the Makefile, name space, support scripts for
       configuring the new PMDA, and the metrics help text.  Fairly simple
       PMDAs can be automatically generated from the config file without
       writing any additional code.  More complicated PMDAs, e.g. containing
       multiple instance domains, require only the refresh methods for the
       instance domains to be written manually.
       An example of the config file format accepted by genpmda is given
       below.
