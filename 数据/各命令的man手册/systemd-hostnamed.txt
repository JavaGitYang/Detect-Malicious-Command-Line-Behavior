       systemd-hostnamed is a system service that may be used as a mechanism
       to change the system's hostname.  systemd-hostnamed is automatically
       activated on request and terminates itself when it is unused.
       The tool hostnamectl(1) is a command line client to this service.
       See the developer documentation[1] for information about the APIs
       systemd-hostnamed provides.
