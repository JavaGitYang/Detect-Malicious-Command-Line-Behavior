       The nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and nearbyintl() functions round their
       argument to an integer value in floating-point format, using the
       current rounding direction (see fesetround(3)) and without raising
       the inexact exception.  When the current rounding direction is to
       nearest, these functions round halfway cases to the even integer in
       accordance with IEEE-754.
       The rint(), rintf(), and rintl() functions do the same, but will
       raise the inexact exception (FE_INEXACT, checkable via
       fetestexcept(3)) when the result differs in value from the argument.
