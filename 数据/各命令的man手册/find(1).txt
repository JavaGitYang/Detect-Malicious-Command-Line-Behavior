       This manual page documents the GNU version of find.  GNU find
       searches the directory tree rooted at each given starting-point by
       evaluating the given expression from left to right, according to the
       rules of precedence (see section OPERATORS), until the outcome is
       known (the left hand side is false for and operations, true for or),
       at which point find moves on to the next file name.  If no starting-
       point is specified, `.' is assumed.
       If you are using find in an environment where security is important
       (for example if you are using it to search directories that are
       writable by other users), you should read the `Security
       Considerations' chapter of the findutils documentation, which is
       called Finding Files and comes with findutils.  That document also
       includes a lot more detail and discussion than this manual page, so
       you may find it a more useful source of information.
