           Note
           You probably donâ€™t want to invoke this command yourself; it is
           started automatically when you use git-credential-cache(1).
       This command listens on the Unix domain socket specified by <socket>
       for git-credential-cache clients. Clients may store and retrieve
       credentials. Each credential is held for a timeout specified by the
       client; once no credentials are held, the daemon exits.
       If the --debug option is specified, the daemon does not close its
       stderr stream, and may output extra diagnostics to it even after it
       has begun listening for clients.
