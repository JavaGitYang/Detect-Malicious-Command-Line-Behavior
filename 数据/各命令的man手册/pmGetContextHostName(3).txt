       Given a valid PCP context identifier previously created with
       pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3), the pmGetContextHostName function
       returns the hostname associated with id.  The pmGetContextHostName_r
       function does the same, but stores the result in a user-supplied
       buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for at least
       MAXHOSTNAMELEN bytes.
       If the context id is associated with an archive source of data, the
       hostname returned is extracted from the archive label using
       pmGetArchiveLabel(3).
       For live contexts, an attempt will first be made to retrieve the
       hostname from the PCP collector system using pmFetch(3) with the
       pmcd.hostname metric.  This allows client tools using this interface
       to retrieve an accurate host identifier even in the presence of port
       forwarding and tunnelled connections.
       Should this not succeed, then a fallback method is used.  For local
       contexts - with local meaning any of DSO, ``localhost'' or Unix
       domain socket connection - a hostname will be sought via
       gethostname(3).  For other contexts, the hostname extracted from the
       initial context host specification will be used.
