       This function will export the features in the provided DER-encoded
       TLS Features PKIX extension, to a gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_t type.  f
       must be initialized.
       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the
       features structure is empty this function will behave identically as
       if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements in the
       features structure then they will be merged with.
