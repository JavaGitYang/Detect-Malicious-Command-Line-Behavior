       chsh is used to change your login shell.  If a shell is not given on
       the command line, chsh prompts for one.
       chsh supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked with
       libuser, otherwise use ypchsh, lchsh or any other implementation for
       non-local entries.
