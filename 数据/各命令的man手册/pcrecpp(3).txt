       The C++ wrapper for PCRE was provided by Google Inc. Some additional
       functionality was added by Giuseppe Maxia. This brief man page was
       constructed from the notes in the pcrecpp.h file, which should be
       consulted for further details. Note that the C++ wrapper supports
       only the original 8-bit PCRE library. There is no 16-bit or 32-bit
       support at present.
