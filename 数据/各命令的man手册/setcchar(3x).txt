   getcchar
       The getcchar function gets a wide-character string and rendition from
       a cchar_t argument.  When wch is not a null pointer, the getcchar
       function does the following:
       ·   Extracts information from a cchar_t value wcval
       ·   Stores the character attributes in the location pointed to by
           attrs
       ·   Stores the color-pair in the location pointed to by color_pair
       ·   Stores the wide-character string, characters referenced by wcval,
           into the array pointed to by wch.
       When wch is a null pointer, the getcchar function does the following:
       ·   Obtains the number of wide characters pointed to by wcval
       ·   Does not change the data referenced by attrs or color_pair
   setcchar
       The setcchar function initializes the location pointed to by wcval by
       using:
       ·   The character attributes in attrs
       ·   The color pair in color_pair
       ·   The wide-character string pointed to by wch.  The string must be
           L'\0' terminated, contain at most one spacing character, which
           must be the first.
           Up to CCHARW_MAX-1 nonspacing characters may follow.  Additional
           nonspacing characters are ignored.
           The string may contain a single control character instead.  In
           that case, no nonspacing characters are allowed.
