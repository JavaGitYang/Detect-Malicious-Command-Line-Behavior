       The fuser utility shall write to standard output the process IDs of
       processes running on the local system that have one or more named
       files open.  For block special devices, all processes using any file
       on that device are listed.
       The fuser utility shall write to standard error additional
       information about the named files indicating how the file is being
       used.
       Any output for processes running on remote systems that have a named
       file open is unspecified.
       A user may need appropriate privileges to invoke the fuser utility.
