       The dirname() function shall take a pointer to a character string
       that contains a pathname, and return a pointer to a string that is a
       pathname of the parent directory of that file. Trailing '/'
       characters in the path are not counted as part of the path.
       If path does not contain a '/', then dirname() shall return a pointer
       to the string ".".  If path is a null pointer or points to an empty
       string, dirname() shall return a pointer to the string ".".
       The dirname() function need not be thread-safe.
