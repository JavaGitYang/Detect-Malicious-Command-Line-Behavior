       The cupsd-helper programs perform long-running operations on behalf
       of the scheduler, cupsd(8).  The cups-deviced helper program runs
       each CUPS backend(7) with no arguments in order to discover the
       available printers.
       The cups-driverd helper program lists all available printer drivers,
       a subset of "matching" printer drivers, or a copy of a specific
       driver PPD file.
       The cups-exec helper program runs backends, filters, and other
       programs. On macOS these programs are run in a secure sandbox.
