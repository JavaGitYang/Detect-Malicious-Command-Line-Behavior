       tgkill() sends the signal sig to the thread with the thread ID tid in
       the thread group tgid.  (By contrast, kill(2) can be used to send a
       signal only to a process (i.e., thread group) as a whole, and the
       signal will be delivered to an arbitrary thread within that process.)
       tkill() is an obsolete predecessor to tgkill().  It allows only the
       target thread ID to be specified, which may result in the wrong
       thread being signaled if a thread terminates and its thread ID is
       recycled.  Avoid using this system call.
       These are the raw system call interfaces, meant for internal thread
       library use.
