       These routines provide various interfaces to the LDAP bind operation.
       After an association with an LDAP server is made using ldap_init(3),
       an LDAP bind operation should be performed before other operations
       are attempted over the connection.  An LDAP bind is required when
       using Version 2 of the LDAP protocol; it is optional for Version 3
       but is usually needed due to security considerations.
       There are three types of bind calls, ones providing simple
       authentication, ones providing SASL authentication, and general
       routines capable of doing either simple or SASL authentication.
       SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) can negotiate one of
       many different kinds of authentication.  Both synchronous and
       asynchronous versions of each variant of the bind call are provided.
       All routines take ld as their first parameter, as returned from
       ldap_init(3).
