       The getgroups() function shall fill in the array grouplist with the
       current supplementary group IDs of the calling process. It is
       implementation-defined whether getgroups() also returns the effective
       group ID in the grouplist array.
       The gidsetsize argument specifies the number of elements in the array
       grouplist.  The actual number of group IDs stored in the array shall
       be returned.  The values of array entries with indices greater than
       or equal to the value returned are undefined.
       If gidsetsize is 0, getgroups() shall return the number of group IDs
       that it would otherwise return without modifying the array pointed to
       by grouplist.
       If the effective group ID of the process is returned with the
       supplementary group IDs, the value returned shall always be greater
       than or equal to one and less than or equal to the value of
       {NGROUPS_MAX}+1.
