       This program is used to enter a system sleep state and to
       automatically wake from it at a specified time.
       This uses cross-platform Linux interfaces to enter a system sleep
       state, and leave it no later than a specified time.  It uses any RTC
       framework driver that supports standard driver model wakeup flags.
       This is normally used like the old apmsleep utility, to wake from a
       suspend state like ACPI S1 (standby) or S3 (suspend-to-RAM).  Most
       platforms can implement those without analogues of BIOS, APM, or
       ACPI.
       On some systems, this can also be used like nvram-wakeup, waking from
       states like ACPI S4 (suspend to disk).  Not all systems have
       persistent media that are appropriate for such suspend modes.
       Note that alarm functionality depends on hardware; not every RTC is
       able to setup an alarm up to 24 hours in the future.
       The suspend setup maybe be interrupted by active hardware; for
       example wireless USB input devices that continue to send events for
       some fraction of a second after the return key is pressed.  rtcwake
       tries to avoid this problem and it waits to terminal to settle down
       before entering a system sleep.
