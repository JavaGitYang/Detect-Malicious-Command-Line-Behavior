       These functions are the reentrant analogs of the functions described
       in drand48(3).  Instead of modifying the global random generator
       state, they use the supplied data buffer.
       Before the first use, this struct must be initialized, for example,
       by filling it with zeros, or by calling one of the functions
       srand48_r(), seed48_r(), or lcong48_r().
