       Tc is used to configure Traffic Control in the Linux kernel. Traffic
       Control consists of the following:
       SHAPING
              When traffic is shaped, its rate of transmission is under
              control. Shaping may be more than lowering the available
              bandwidth - it is also used to smooth out bursts in traffic
              for better network behaviour. Shaping occurs on egress.
       SCHEDULING
              By scheduling the transmission of packets it is possible to
              improve interactivity for traffic that needs it while still
              guaranteeing bandwidth to bulk transfers. Reordering is also
              called prioritizing, and happens only on egress.
       POLICING
              Whereas shaping deals with transmission of traffic, policing
              pertains to traffic arriving. Policing thus occurs on ingress.
       DROPPING
              Traffic exceeding a set bandwidth may also be dropped
              forthwith, both on ingress and on egress.
       Processing of traffic is controlled by three kinds of objects:
       qdiscs, classes and filters.
