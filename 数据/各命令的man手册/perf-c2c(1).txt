       C2C stands for Cache To Cache.
       The perf c2c tool provides means for Shared Data C2C/HITM analysis.
       It allows you to track down the cacheline contentions.
       The tool is based on x86â€™s load latency and precise store facility
       events provided by Intel CPUs. These events provide: - memory address
       of the access - type of the access (load and store details) - latency
       (in cycles) of the load access
       The c2c tool provide means to record this data and report back access
       details for cachelines with highest contention - highest number of
       HITM accesses.
       The basic workflow with this tool follows the standard record/report
       phase. User uses the record command to record events data and report
       command to display it.
