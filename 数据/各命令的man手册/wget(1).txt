       GNU Wget is a free utility for non-interactive download of files from
       the Web.  It supports HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, as well as
       retrieval through HTTP proxies.
       Wget is non-interactive, meaning that it can work in the background,
       while the user is not logged on.  This allows you to start a
       retrieval and disconnect from the system, letting Wget finish the
       work.  By contrast, most of the Web browsers require constant user's
       presence, which can be a great hindrance when transferring a lot of
       data.
       Wget can follow links in HTML, XHTML, and CSS pages, to create local
       versions of remote web sites, fully recreating the directory
       structure of the original site.  This is sometimes referred to as
       "recursive downloading."  While doing that, Wget respects the Robot
       Exclusion Standard (/robots.txt).  Wget can be instructed to convert
       the links in downloaded files to point at the local files, for
       offline viewing.
       Wget has been designed for robustness over slow or unstable network
       connections; if a download fails due to a network problem, it will
       keep retrying until the whole file has been retrieved.  If the server
       supports regetting, it will instruct the server to continue the
       download from where it left off.
