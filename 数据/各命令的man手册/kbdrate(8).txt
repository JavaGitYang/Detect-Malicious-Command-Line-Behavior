       kbdrate is used to change the keyboard repeat rate and delay time.
       The delay is the amount of time that a key must be depressed before
       it will start to repeat.
       Using kbdrate without any options will reset the repeat rate to 10.9
       characters per second (cps) and the delay to 250 milliseconds (ms)
       for Intel- and M68K-based systems.  These are the IBM defaults. On
       SPARC-based systems it will reset the repeat rate to 5 cps and the
       delay to 200 ms.
