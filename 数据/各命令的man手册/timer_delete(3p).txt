       The timer_delete() function deletes the specified timer, timerid,
       previously created by the timer_create() function. If the timer is
       armed when timer_delete() is called, the behavior shall be as if the
       timer is automatically disarmed before removal. The disposition of
       pending signals for the deleted timer is unspecified.
