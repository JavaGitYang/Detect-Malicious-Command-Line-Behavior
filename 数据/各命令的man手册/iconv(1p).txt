       The iconv utility shall convert the encoding of characters in file
       from one codeset to another and write the results to standard output.
       When the options indicate that charmap files are used to specify the
       codesets (see OPTIONS), the codeset conversion shall be accomplished
       by performing a logical join on the symbolic character names in the
       two charmaps. The implementation need not support the use of charmap
       files for codeset conversion unless the POSIX2_LOCALEDEF symbol is
       defined on the system.
