       The pthread_cancel() function shall request that thread be canceled.
       The target thread's cancelability state and type determines when the
       cancellation takes effect. When the cancellation is acted on, the
       cancellation cleanup handlers for thread shall be called. When the
       last cancellation cleanup handler returns, the thread-specific data
       destructor functions shall be called for thread.  When the last
       destructor function returns, thread shall be terminated.
       The cancellation processing in the target thread shall run
       asynchronously with respect to the calling thread returning from
       pthread_cancel().
