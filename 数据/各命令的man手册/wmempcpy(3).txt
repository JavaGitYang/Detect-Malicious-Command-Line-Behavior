       The mempcpy() function is nearly identical to the memcpy(3) function.
       It copies n bytes from the object beginning at src into the object
       pointed to by dest.  But instead of returning the value of dest it
       returns a pointer to the byte following the last written byte.
       This function is useful in situations where a number of objects shall
       be copied to consecutive memory positions.
       The wmempcpy() function is identical but takes wchar_t type arguments
       and copies n wide characters.
