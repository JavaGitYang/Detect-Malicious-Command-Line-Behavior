       btt is a post-processing tool for the block layer IO tracing tool
       called blktrace(8).  As noted in its documentation, blktrace is a
       block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed information
       about request queue operations up to user space.
       btt will take in binary dump data from blkparse, and analyse the
       events, producing a series of output from the analysis. It will also
       build .dat files containing "range data" -- showing things like Q
       activity (periods of time while Q events are being produced), C
       activity (likewise for command completions), and etc.
       Included with the distribution is a simple 3D plotting utility,
       bno_plot, which can plot the block numbers btt outputs if the -B
       option is specified. The display will display each IO generated, with
       the time (seconds) along the X-axis, the block number (start) along
       the Y-axis and the number of blocks transferred in the IO represented
       along the Z-axis.
