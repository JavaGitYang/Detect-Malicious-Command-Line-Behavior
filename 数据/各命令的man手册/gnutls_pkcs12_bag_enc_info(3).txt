       This function will provide information on the encryption algorithms
       used in an encrypted bag. If the structure algorithms are unknown the
       code GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_TYPE will be returned, and only  oid ,
       will be set. That is,  oid will be set on encrypted bags whether
       supported or not. It must be deinitialized using gnutls_free().  The
       other variables are only set on supported structures.
