       This function will set the subject alternative name certificate
       extension. This function assumes that data can be expressed as a null
       terminated string.
       The name of the function is unfortunate since it is inconsistent with
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_name().
       See gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() for more information.
