       auparse_set_escape_mode is used to set the escaping method that will
       be used to output interpretted text. The choices for the mode
       variable are:
              AUPARSE_ESC_RAW
                     No escaping of any kind is done.
              AUPARSE_ESC_TTY
                     Escape TTY control characters so that they are harmless
                     to display on a terminal. When any control character is
                     found, they are displayed as octal numbers. This is the
                     default mode that the auparse library is initialized
                     with.
              AUPARSE_ESC_SHELL
                     Besides escaping control characters, this will escape
                     some characters that can cause problems when used with
                     shell scripting. Any escaped control characters are
                     displayed as octal numbers. Other escaped characters
                     are proceeded with a backslash. The additional
                     characters it escapes are: " ' ` $ \
              AUPARSE_ESC_SHELL_QUOTE
                     Similar to AUPARSE_ESC_SHELL but expands the character
                     set to include shell operators. Any escaped control
                     characters are displayed as octal numbers. Other
                     escaped characters are proceeded with a backslash. The
                     additional characters it escapes include: ; '  " ` # $
                     & * ? [ ] < > { } \
