       The dbprobe utility is used by pmdadbping(1) to measure response time
       from a database.  A given query is executed on the database at the
       requested interval (delay, which defaults to 60 seconds).  This
       response time measure can be exported via the Performance Co-Pilot
       framework for live and historical monitoring using pmdadbping(1).
