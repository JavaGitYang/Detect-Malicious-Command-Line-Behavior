       pmdahaproxy is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts live performance data from HAProxy statistics socket or URL.
       By default the HAProxy stats socket is used to retrieve the metric
       but if the optional URL option is set (see below), then the HAProxy
       URL is used instead.
       See the HAProxy documentation for detailed description of each
       metric.
