       pmieconf is a utility for viewing and configuring variables from
       generalized pmie(1) rules.  The set of generalized rules is read in
       from rulepath, and the output file produced by pmieconf is a valid
       input file for pmie.
       A brief description of the pmieconf command line options follows:
       -c      When run from automated pmie setup processes, this option is
               used to add a specific message and timestamp indicating that
               this is the case.  It is not appropriate when using the tool
               interactively.
       -f file Any rule modifications resulting from pmieconf manipulation
               of variable values will be written to file.  The default
               value of file is dependent on the user ID - for the root
               user, the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf/config.pmie is
               used, for other users the default is
               $HOME/.pcp/pmie/config.pmie.
       -F      Forces the pmieconf output file to be created (or updated),
               after which pmieconf immediately exits.
       -r rulepath
               Allows the source of generalized pmie rules to be changed -
               rulepath is a colon-delimited list of pmieconf(5) rule files
               and/or subdirectories.  The default value for rulepath is
               $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf.  Use of this option overrides
               the PMIECONF_PATH environment variable which has a similar
               function.
       -v      Verbose mode.  Additional information associated with each
               rule and its associated variables will be displayed.  This is
               the complete list of variables which affects any given rule
               (by default, global variables are not displayed with the
               rule).
       The pmieconf commands allow information related to the various rules
       and configurable variables to be displayed or modified.  If no
       pmieconf commands are presented on the command line, pmieconf prompts
       for commands interactively.
       The pmieconf command language is described here:
       help  [ { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>] ]
               Without arguments, the help command displays the syntax for
               all of the available pmieconf commands.  With one argument, a
               description of one or more of the generalized rules is
               displayed.  With two arguments, a description of a specific
               variable relating to one or more of the generalized rules is
               displayed.
       rules  [ enabled | disabled ]
               Display the name and short summary for all of the generalized
               rules found on rulepath.  Each of the rule names can be used
               in place of the keyword <rule> in this command syntax
               description.  The enabled and disabled options can be used to
               filter the set of rules displayed to just those which are
               enabled or disabled respectfully.
       groups  Display the name of all of the rule groups that were found on
               rulepath.  Each of the group names can be used in place of
               the keyword <group> in this command syntax description, which
               applies the command to all rules within the rule group.
       status  Display status information relating to the current pmieconf
               session, including a list of running pmie processes which are
               currently using file.
       enable  { . | all | <rule> | <group> }
               Enables the specified rule or group of rules.  An enabled
               rule is one which will be included in the pmie configuration
               file generated by pmieconf.  Any enabled "actions" will be
               appended to the rule's "predicate", in a manner conforming to
               the pmie syntax ("actions" can be viewed using the list
               global command, described below).
       disable  { . | all | <rule> | <group> }
               Disables the specified rule or group of rules.  If the rule
               was previously enabled, it will be removed from the pmie
               configuration file generated by pmieconf, and hence no longer
               evaluated when pmie is restarted (using pmieconf does not
               affect any existing pmie processes using file).
       list  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>]
               Display the values for a specific rule variable; or for all
               variables of a rule, a rule group, all rules, or the global
               variables.
       modify  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } <variable> <value>
               Enable, disable, or otherwise change the value for one or
               more rule variables.  This value must be consistent with the
               type of the variable, which can be inferred from the format
               of the printed value - e.g. strings will be enclosed in
               double-quotes, percentages have the ``%'' symbol appended,
               etc.  Note that certain rule variables cannot be modified
               through pmieconf - "predicate" and "help", for example.
       undo  { . | all | global | <rule> | <group> } [<variable>]
               Applicable only to a variable whose value has been modified -
               this command simply reverts to the default value for the
               given variable.
       quit    Save any changes made to file and then exit pmieconf.
       abort   Exit pmieconf immediately without saving any changes to file.
       Each of the commands above can be shortened by simply using the first
       character of the command name, and also ``?'' for help.
       Use of the all keyword causes the command to be applied to all of the
       rules.  The global keyword refers to those variables which are
       applied to every rule.  Such variables can be changed either globally
       or locally, for example:
         pmieconf> modify global delta "5 minutes"
         pmieconf> modify memory delta "1 minute"
       causes all rules to now be evaluated once every five minutes, except
       for rules in the "memory" group which are to be evaluated once per
       minute.
       The ``.'' character is special to pmieconf - it refers to the last
       successfully used value of all, global, <rule> or <group>.
