       The look utility displays any lines in file which contain string.  As
       look performs a binary search, the lines in file must be sorted
       (where sort(1) was given the same options -d and/or -f that look is
       invoked with).
       If file is not specified, the file /usr/share/dict/words is used,
       only alphanumeric characters are compared and the case of alphabetic
       characters is ignored.
