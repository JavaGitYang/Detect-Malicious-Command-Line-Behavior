       The ovs-l3ping program may be used to check for problems that could
       be caused by invalid routing policy, misconfigured firewall in the
       tunnel path or a bad NIC driver.  On one of the nodes, run ovs-l3ping
       in server mode and on the other node run it in client mode.  The
       client and server will establish L3 tunnel, over which client will
       give further testing instructions. The ovs-l3ping client will perform
       UDP and TCP tests.  This tool is different from ovs-test that it
       encapsulates XML/RPC control connection over the tunnel, so there is
       no need to open special holes in firewall.
       UDP tests can report packet loss and achieved bandwidth for various
       datagram sizes. By default target bandwidth for UDP tests is 1Mbit/s.
       TCP tests report only achieved bandwidth, because kernel TCP stack
       takes care of flow control and packet loss.
   Client Mode
       An ovs-l3ping client will create a L3 tunnel and connect over it to
       the ovs-l3ping server to schedule the tests. TunnelRemoteIP is the
       peer's IP address, where tunnel will be terminated. InnerIP is the
       address that will be temporarily assigned during testing.  All test
       traffic originating from this IP address to the RemoteInnerIP will be
       tunneled.  It is possible to override default ControlPort and
       DataPort, if there is any other application that already listens on
       those two ports.
   Server Mode
       To conduct tests, ovs-l3ping server must be running.  It is required
       that both client and server InnerIP addresses are in the same subnet.
       It is possible to specify InnerIP with netmask in CIDR format.
