       documentation is meant for people who are studying the plumbing
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.
       git sh-i18n--envsubst is Git’s stripped-down copy of the GNU
       envsubst(1) program that comes with the GNU gettext package. It’s
       used internally by git-sh-i18n(1) to interpolate the variables passed
       to the eval_gettext function.
       No promises are made about the interface, or that this program won’t
       disappear without warning in the next version of Git. Don’t use it.
