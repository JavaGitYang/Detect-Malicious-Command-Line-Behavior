       When invoked without the -D option, the useradd command creates a new
       user account using the values specified on the command line plus the
       default values from the system. Depending on command line options,
       the useradd command will update system files and may also create the
       new user's home directory and copy initial files.
       By default, a group will also be created for the new user (see -g,
       -N, -U, and USERGROUPS_ENAB).
