       This function will override the timeouts for the DTLS heartbeat
       protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
       message from the peer is not received, the previous request will be
       retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
       handshake will be aborted with GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT.
