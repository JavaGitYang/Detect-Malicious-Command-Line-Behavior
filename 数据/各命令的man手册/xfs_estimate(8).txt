       For each directory argument, xfs_estimate estimates the space that
       directory would take if it were copied to an XFS filesystem.
       xfs_estimate does not cross mount points.  The following definitions
       are used:
              KB = *1024
              MB = *1024*1024
              GB = *1024*1024*1024
       The xfs_estimate options are:
       -b blocksize
              Use blocksize instead of the default blocksize of 4096 bytes.
              The modifier k can be used after the number to indicate
              multiplication by 1024.  For example,
                   xfs_estimate -b 64k /
              requests an estimate of the space required by the directory /
              on an XFS filesystem using a blocksize of 64K (65536) bytes.
       -v     Display more information, formatted.
       -h     Display usage message.
       -i, -e logsize
              Use logsize instead of the default log size of 1000 blocks.
              -i refers to an internal log, while -e refers to an external
              log.  The modifiers k or m can be used after the number to
              indicate multiplication by 1024 or 1048576, respectively.
              For example,
                   xfs_estimate -i 1m /
              requests an estimate of the space required by the directory /
              on an XFS filesystem using an internal log of 1 megabyte.
       -V     Print the version number and exits.
