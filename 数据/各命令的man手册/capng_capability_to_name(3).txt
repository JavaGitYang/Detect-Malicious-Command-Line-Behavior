       capng_capabilityi_to_name will take the integer being passed and look
       it up to see what its text string representation would be. The
       integer being input must be in the valid range defined in
       linux/capabiliy.h. The string that is output is the same as the
       define text from linux/capabiliy.h with the CAP_ prefix removed and
       lower case. This is useful for taking integer representation and
       converting it to something more user friendly for display.
