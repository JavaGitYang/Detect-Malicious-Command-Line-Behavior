       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wmemcmp() function shall compare the first n wide characters of
       the object pointed to by ws1 to the first n wide characters of the
       object pointed to by ws2.  This function shall not be affected by
       locale and all wchar_t values shall be treated identically. The null
       wide character and wchar_t values not corresponding to valid
       characters shall not be treated specially.
       If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and ws2 are valid
       pointers, and the function shall behave as if the two objects compare
       equal.
