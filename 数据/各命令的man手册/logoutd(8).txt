       logoutd enforces the login time and port restrictions specified in
       /etc/porttime.  logoutd should be started from /etc/rc. The
       /var/run/utmp file is scanned periodically and each user name is
       checked to see if the named user is permitted on the named port at
       the current time. Any login session which is violating the
       restrictions in /etc/porttime is terminated.
