       Returns the current session ID. This can be used if you want to check
       if the next session you tried to resume was actually resumed.  That
       is because resumed sessions share the same session ID with the
       original session.
       The session ID is selected by the server, that identify the current
       session.  In all supported TLS protocols, the session id is less than
       GNUTLS_MAX_SESSION_ID_SIZE.
