       The devlink utility can monitor the state of devlink devices and
       ports continuously. This option has a slightly different format.
       Namely, the monitor command is the first in the command line and then
       the object list.
       OBJECT-LIST is the list of object types that we want to monitor.  It
       may contain dev, port.
       devlink opens Devlink Netlink socket, listens on it and dumps state
       changes.
