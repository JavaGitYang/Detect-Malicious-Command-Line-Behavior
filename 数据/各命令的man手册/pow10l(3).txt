       These functions return the value of 10 raised to the power x.
       Note well: These functions perform exactly the same task as the
       functions described in exp10(3), with the difference that the latter
       functions are now standardized in TS 18661-4:2015.  Those latter
       functions should be used in preference to the functions described in
       this page.
