       A really simple TCP Git daemon that normally listens on port
       "DEFAULT_GIT_PORT" aka 9418. It waits for a connection asking for a
       service, and will serve that service if it is enabled.
       It verifies that the directory has the magic file
       "git-daemon-export-ok", and it will refuse to export any Git
       directory that hasnâ€™t explicitly been marked for export this way
       (unless the --export-all parameter is specified). If you pass some
       directory paths as git daemon arguments, you can further restrict the
       offers to a whitelist comprising of those.
       By default, only upload-pack service is enabled, which serves git
       fetch-pack and git ls-remote clients, which are invoked from git
       fetch, git pull, and git clone.
       This is ideally suited for read-only updates, i.e., pulling from Git
       repositories.
       An upload-archive also exists to serve git archive.
