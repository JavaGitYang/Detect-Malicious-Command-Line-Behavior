       Provided that the current Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) context is associated with a set of archive logs,
       pmNameInDomArchive will scan the union of all the instance domain
       metadata for the instance domain indom, locate the first instance
       with the internal instance identifier given by inst, and return the
       full external instance identification via name.
       This routine is a specialized version of the more general PMAPI
       routine pmNameInDom.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       The space for the value of name will have been allocated in
       pmNameInDomArchive with malloc(3), and it is the responsibility of
       the caller to free(3) the space when it is no longer required.
       pmNameInDomArchive returns zero on success.
