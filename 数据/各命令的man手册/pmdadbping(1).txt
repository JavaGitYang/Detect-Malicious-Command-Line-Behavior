       pmdadbping is a database response time measurement PMDA.
       pmdadbping runs dbprobe(1), and exports the performance measurements
       it makes available as PCP metrics.
       dbprobe(1) should be configured to use the type of DBI appropriate
       for the local database, which includes: RDBMS flavour, user/password,
       delay between "ping" requests, and the SQL statement to use.
