       The lttng disable-channel command disables one or more channels
       previously enabled by the lttng-enable-channel(1) command.
       A channel is always contained in a tracing session (see
       lttng-create(1) for creating a tracing session). The session in which
       a channel is disabled using lttng disable-channel can be specified
       using the --session option. If the --session option is omitted, the
       current tracing session is targeted.
       Note that re-enabling a disabled channel once its tracing session has
       been active at least once is currently not supported.
