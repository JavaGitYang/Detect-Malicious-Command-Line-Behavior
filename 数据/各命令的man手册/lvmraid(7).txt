       lvm(8) RAID is a way to create a Logical Volume (LV) that uses
       multiple physical devices to improve performance or tolerate device
       failures.  In LVM, the physical devices are Physical Volumes (PVs) in
       a single Volume Group (VG).
       How LV data blocks are placed onto PVs is determined by the RAID
       level.  RAID levels are commonly referred to as 'raid' followed by a
       number, e.g.  raid1, raid5 or raid6.  Selecting a RAID level involves
       making tradeoffs among: physical device requirements, fault
       tolerance, and performance.  A description of the RAID levels can be
       found at

       LVM RAID uses both Device Mapper (DM) and Multiple Device (MD)
       drivers from the Linux kernel.  DM is used to create and manage
       visible LVM devices, and MD is used to place data on physical
       devices.
       LVM creates hidden LVs (dm devices) layered between the visible LV
       and physical devices.  LVs in the middle layers are called sub LVs.
       For LVM raid, a sub LV pair to store data and metadata (raid
       superblock and write intent bitmap) is created per raid image/leg
       (see lvs command examples below).
