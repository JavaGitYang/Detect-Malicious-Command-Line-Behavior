       The gettimeofday() function shall obtain the current time, expressed
       as seconds and microseconds since the Epoch, and store it in the
       timeval structure pointed to by tp.  The resolution of the system
       clock is unspecified.
       If tzp is not a null pointer, the behavior is unspecified.
