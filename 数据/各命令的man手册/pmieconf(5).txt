       The pmieconf file formats are used by the pmieconf(1) tool as a way
       to generalize pmie(1) rule sets such that they can be easily
       configured for different systems and different environments.  There
       are two completely different (although closely related) file formats
       discussed here, namely ``pmieconf-rules'' and ``pmieconf-pmie''.
       The directory $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf contains information about
       all the default system pmie generalized rules and variables,
       including default values for all variables.  These files are in the
       pmieconf-rules format.  Although new pmieconf-rules files can be
       added, the files in this directory should never be changed.  Instead,
       use the pmieconf utility to change variable values in the pmie
       configuration file.
       The pmieconf-pmie format allows site specific customizations of the
       rules contained in pmieconf-rules files and their associated
       variables.  The pmieconf-pmie format is generated by pmieconf and
       should not be edited by hand.  This generated file is in the pmie
       format, with some additional information held at the head of the file
       - thus, the pmieconf-pmie format is a superset of the pmie file
       format (extended to hold customizations to the generalized rules, but
       also containing the actual performance rules for pmie to evaluate)
       which can also be parsed by pmie (all extensions are hidden within
       comments, and are thus meaningless to pmie itself).
       The file $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf/config.pmie contains local
       system settings for pmieconf configurable variables.  The variable
       settings in this file replace the default values specified in
       $PCP_VAR_DIR/config/pmieconf/*/*.
