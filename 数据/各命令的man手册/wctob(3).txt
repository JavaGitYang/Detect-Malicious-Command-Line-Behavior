       The wctob() function tests whether the multibyte representation of
       the wide character c, starting in the initial state, consists of a
       single byte.  If so, it is returned as an unsigned char.
       Never use this function.  It cannot help you in writing
       internationalized programs.  Internationalized programs must never
       distinguish single-byte and multibyte characters.
