       lvscan scans all VGs or all supported LVM block devices in the system
       for LVs. The output consists of one line for each LV indicating
       whether or not it is active, a snapshot or origin, the size of the
       device and its allocation policy. Use lvs(8) or lvdisplay(8) to
       obtain more comprehensive information about LVs.
