       Iterate over all refs that match <pattern> and show them according to
       the given <format>, after sorting them according to the given set of
       <key>. If <count> is given, stop after showing that many refs. The
       interpolated values in <format> can optionally be quoted as string
       literals in the specified host language allowing their direct
       evaluation in that language.
