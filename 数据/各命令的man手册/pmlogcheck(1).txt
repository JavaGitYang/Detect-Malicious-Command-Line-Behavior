       pmlogcheck prints information about the nature of any invalid data
       which it detects in the files of a PCP archive.
       The archive has the base name archive and must have been previously
       created using pmlogger(1).
       Normally pmlogcheck operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (pmns(5)), however if the -n option is specified an alternative
       namespace is loaded from the file pmnsfile.
       The command line options -S and -T can be used to specify a time
       window over which metrics should be checked in Pass 3 (see below).
       These options are common to many Performance Co-Pilot tools and are
       fully described in PCPIntro(1).
       The -l option prints the archive label, showing the log format
       version, the time and date for the start and (current) end of the
       archive, and the host from which the performance metrics values were
       collected.
       By default, pmlogcheck reports the time of day according to the local
       timezone on the system where pmlogcheck is run.  The -Z option
       changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the environment
       variable TZ as described in environ(7).  The -z option changes the
       timezone to the local timezone at the host that is the source of the
       performance metrics, as specified in the label record of the archive
       log.
       The checking proceeds in a number of passes, each designed to
       validate progressively more complex semantic relationships between
       the information in a PCP archive.
