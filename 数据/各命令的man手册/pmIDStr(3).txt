       For use in error and diagnostic messages, pmIDStr returns a `human
       readable' version of the specified Performance Metric Identifier
       (PMID).  The pmIDStr_r function does the same, but stores the result
       in a user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have
       room for at least 20 bytes.
       Internally, a PMID is encoded with three fields: domain, cluster and
       item.  pmIDStr returns a string with each of the fields appearing as
       decimal numbers, separated by periods.
       The string value result from pmIDStr is held in a single static
       buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the next call to
       pmIDStr.
