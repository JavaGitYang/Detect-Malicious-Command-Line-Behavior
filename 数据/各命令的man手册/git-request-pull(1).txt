       Generate a request asking your upstream project to pull changes into
       their tree. The request, printed to the standard output, begins with
       the branch description, summarizes the changes and indicates from
       where they can be pulled.
       The upstream project is expected to have the commit named by <start>
       and the output asks it to integrate the changes you made since that
       commit, up to the commit named by <end>, by visiting the repository
       named by <url>.
