       The posix_trace_eventid_equal() function shall compare the trace
       event type identifiers event1 and event2 from the same trace stream
       or the same trace log identified by the trid argument. If the trace
       event type identifiers event1 and event2 are from different trace
       streams, the return value shall be unspecified.
       The posix_trace_eventid_get_name() function shall return, in the
       argument pointed to by event_name, the trace event name associated
       with the trace event type identifier identified by the argument
       event, for the trace stream or for the trace log identified by the
       trid argument. The name of the trace event shall have a maximum of
       {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  Successive calls to this function
       with the same trace event type identifier and the same trace stream
       identifier shall return the same event name.
       The posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall associate a user
       trace event name with a trace event type identifier for a given trace
       stream. The trace stream is identified by the trid argument, and it
       shall be an active trace stream. The trace event name is the string
       pointed to by the argument event_name.  It shall have a maximum of
       {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  The number of user trace event type
       identifiers that can be defined for any given process is limited by
       the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.
       If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
       posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the event_name argument with a trace
       event type identifier that is unique for the process being traced in
       the trace stream identified by the trid argument, and is returned in
       the variable pointed to by the event argument. If the user trace
       event name has already been mapped for the traced process, then the
       previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be returned. If
       the per-process user trace event name limit represented by
       {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-defined
       POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Table 2-7, Trace Option: User
       Trace Event) user trace event shall be returned.
       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
       posix_trace_trid_eventid_open() function shall associate the user
       trace event name pointed to by the event_name argument with a trace
       event type identifier that is unique for all the processes being
       traced in the trace stream identified by the trid argument, and is
       returned in the variable pointed to by the event argument. If the
       user trace event name has already been mapped for the traced
       processes, then the previously assigned trace event type identifier
       shall be returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit
       represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-
       defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Table 2-7, Trace Option:
       User Trace Event) user trace event shall be returned.
