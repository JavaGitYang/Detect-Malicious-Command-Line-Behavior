       The pipe() function shall create a pipe and place two file
       descriptors, one each into the arguments fildes[0] and fildes[1],
       that refer to the open file descriptions for the read and write ends
       of the pipe. Their integer values shall be the two lowest available
       at the time of the pipe() call. The O_NONBLOCK and FD_CLOEXEC flags
       shall be clear on both file descriptors. (The fcntl() function can be
       used to set both these flags.)
       Data can be written to the file descriptor fildes[1] and read from
       the file descriptor fildes[0].  A read on the file descriptor
       fildes[0] shall access data written to the file descriptor fildes[1]
       on a first-in-first-out basis. It is unspecified whether fildes[0] is
       also open for writing and whether fildes[1] is also open for reading.
       A process has the pipe open for reading (correspondingly writing) if
       it has a file descriptor open that refers to the read end, fildes[0]
       (write end, fildes[1]).
       The pipe's user ID shall be set to the effective user ID of the
       calling process.
       The pipe's group ID shall be set to the effective group ID of the
       calling process.
       Upon successful completion, pipe() shall mark for update the last
       data access, last data modification, and last file status change
       timestamps of the pipe.
