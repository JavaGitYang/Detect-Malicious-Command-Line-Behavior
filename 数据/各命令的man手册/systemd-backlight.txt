       systemd-backlight@.service is a service that restores the display
       backlight brightness at early boot and saves it at shutdown. On disk,
       the backlight brightness is stored in /var/lib/systemd/backlight/.
       During loading, if the udev property ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP is not set to
       false, the brightness is clamped to a value of at least 1 or 5% of
       maximum brightness, whichever is greater. This restriction will be
       removed when the kernel allows user space to reliably set a
       brightness value which does not turn off the display.
