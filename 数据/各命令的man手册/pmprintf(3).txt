       The combination of pmprintf and pmflush produces output in either an
       xconfirm(1) window, on the standard error stream, or to a file in a
       manner similar to fprintf(3).  The fmt argument is used to control
       the conversion, formatting, and printing of the variable length args
       list.  The output technique is controlled via an environment
       variable.
       pmprintf appends the formatted message string to an internal buffer
       shared by the two routines, without actually producing any output.
       pmflush causes the internal buffer to be either displayed in a
       window, printed on standard error, or flushed to a file and the
       internal buffer to be cleared.
