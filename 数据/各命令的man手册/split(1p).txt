       The split utility shall read an input file and write one or more
       output files.  The default size of each output file shall be 1000
       lines. The size of the output files can be modified by specification
       of the −b or −l options. Each output file shall be created with a
       unique suffix. The suffix shall consist of exactly suffix_length
       lowercase letters from the POSIX locale. The letters of the suffix
       shall be used as if they were a base-26 digit system, with the first
       suffix to be created consisting of all 'a' characters, the second
       with a 'b' replacing the last 'a', and so on, until a name of all 'z'
       characters is created. By default, the names of the output files
       shall be 'x', followed by a two-character suffix from the character
       set as described above, starting with "aa", "ab", "ac", and so on,
       and continuing until the suffix "zz", for a maximum of 676 files.
       If the number of files required exceeds the maximum allowed by the
       suffix length provided, such that the last allowable file would be
       larger than the requested size, the split utility shall fail after
       creating the last file with a valid suffix; split shall not delete
       the files it created with valid suffixes. If the file limit is not
       exceeded, the last file created shall contain the remainder of the
       input file, and may be smaller than the requested size.
