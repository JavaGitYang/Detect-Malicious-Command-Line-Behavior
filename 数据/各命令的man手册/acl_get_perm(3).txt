     The acl_get_perm() function tests if the permission specified by the
     argument perm (one of ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE, ACL_EXECUTE) is contained in
     the ACL permission set pointed to by the argument permset_d.
     Any existing descriptors that refer to permset_d continue to refer to
     that permission set.
