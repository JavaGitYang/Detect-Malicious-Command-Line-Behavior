       sem_open() creates a new POSIX semaphore or opens an existing
       semaphore.  The semaphore is identified by name.  For details of the
       construction of name, see sem_overview(7).
       The oflag argument specifies flags that control the operation of the
       call.  (Definitions of the flags values can be obtained by including
       <fcntl.h>.)  If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then the semaphore is
       created if it does not already exist.  The owner (user ID) of the
       semaphore is set to the effective user ID of the calling process.
       The group ownership (group ID) is set to the effective group ID of
       the calling process.  If both O_CREAT and O_EXCL are specified in
       oflag, then an error is returned if a semaphore with the given name
       already exists.
       If O_CREAT is specified in oflag, then two additional arguments must
       be supplied.  The mode argument specifies the permissions to be
       placed on the new semaphore, as for open(2).  (Symbolic definitions
       for the permissions bits can be obtained by including <sys/stat.h>.)
       The permissions settings are masked against the process umask.  Both
       read and write permission should be granted to each class of user
       that will access the semaphore.  The value argument specifies the
       initial value for the new semaphore.  If O_CREAT is specified, and a
       semaphore with the given name already exists, then mode and value are
       ignored.
