       This plugin changes other commands in yum, much like the alias
       command in bash. There are a couple of notable differences from shell
       style aliases though. The alias command has three forms:
        * alias
        * alias command
        * alias command result
       The first form lists all current aliases with their final result, the
       second form looks up a "command" and shows it's final result or an
       error message. The last form creates a new alias.
