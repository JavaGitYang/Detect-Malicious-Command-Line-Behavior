       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaText uses the standard PMDA(3) data structures to
       return the help text for metric ident in buffer.  The help text must
       be located in help text files created with newhelp(1), and the
       associated files are automatically opened by pmdaInit(3).
       The path to the (basename of the) help text files can be set in the
       calls to pmdaDSO(3) or pmdaDaemon(3) and overridden by the -h command
       line option in pmdaGetOpt(3).
       The encoding of ident follows the internal scheme used below the
       routines pmLookupText(3) and pmLookupInDomText(3), namely ident
       encodes either a metric identifier or an instance domain identifier,
       according to the value of type.
       The type argument is a bit mask that encodes the interpretation of
       ident and the requested form of help text, as follows: either
       PM_TEXT_PMID if ident is a metric identifier, or PM_TEXT_INDOM if
       ident is an instance domain identifier, plus either PM_TEXT_ONELINE
       for the one line help text or PM_TEXT_HELP for the full help text.
       The buffer is managed internally (usually it is cached), and it
       should not be released or freed by the caller of pmdaText.
