       This function will register a new extension type. The extension will
       be only usable within the registered session. If the extension type
       is already registered then GNUTLS_E_ALREADY_REGISTERED will be
       returned, unless the flag GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_OVERRIDE_INTERNAL is
       specified. The latter flag when specified can be used to override
       certain extensions introduced after 3.6.0. It is expected to be used
       by applications which handle custom extensions that are not currently
       supported in GnuTLS, but direct support for them may be added in the
       future.
       Each registered extension can store temporary data into the
       gnutls_session_t structure using gnutls_ext_set_data(), and they can
       be retrieved using gnutls_ext_get_data().
