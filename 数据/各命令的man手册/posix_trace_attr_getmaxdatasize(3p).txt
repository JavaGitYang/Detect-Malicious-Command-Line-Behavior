       The posix_trace_attr_getlogsize() function shall copy the log size,
       in bytes, from the log-max-size attribute of the attributes object
       pointed to by the attr argument into the variable pointed to by the
       logsize argument. This log size is the maximum total of bytes that
       shall be allocated for system and user trace events in the trace log.
       The default value for the log-max-size attribute is implementation-
       defined.
       The posix_trace_attr_setlogsize() function shall set the maximum
       allowed size, in bytes, in the log-max-size attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument, using the size
       value supplied by the logsize argument.
       The trace log size shall be used if the log-full-policy attribute is
       set to POSIX_TRACE_LOOP or POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL. If the log-full-
       policy attribute is set to POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the implementation
       shall ignore the log-max-size attribute.
       The posix_trace_attr_getmaxdatasize() function shall copy the maximum
       user trace event data size, in bytes, from the max-data-size
       attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr argument
       into the variable pointed to by the maxdatasize argument. The default
       value for the max-data-size attribute is implementation-defined.
       The posix_trace_attr_getmaxsystemeventsize() function shall calculate
       the maximum memory size, in bytes, required to store a single system
       trace event. This value is calculated for the trace stream attributes
       object pointed to by the attr argument and is returned in the
       variable pointed to by the eventsize argument.
       The values returned as the maximum memory sizes of the user and
       system trace events shall be such that if the sum of the maximum
       memory sizes of a set of the trace events that may be recorded in a
       trace stream is less than or equal to the stream-min-size attribute
       of that trace stream, the system provides the necessary resources for
       recording all those trace events, without loss.
       The posix_trace_attr_getmaxusereventsize() function shall calculate
       the maximum memory size, in bytes, required to store a single user
       trace event generated by a call to posix_trace_event() with a
       data_len parameter equal to the data_len value specified in this
       call. This value is calculated for the trace stream attributes object
       pointed to by the attr argument and is returned in the variable
       pointed to by the eventsize argument.
       The posix_trace_attr_getstreamsize() function shall copy the stream
       size, in bytes, from the stream-min-size attribute of the attributes
       object pointed to by the attr argument into the variable pointed to
       by the streamsize argument.
       This stream size is the current total memory size reserved for system
       and user trace events in the trace stream. The default value for the
       stream-min-size attribute is implementation-defined. The stream size
       refers to memory used to store trace event records. Other stream data
       (for example, trace attribute values) shall not be included in this
       size.
       The posix_trace_attr_setmaxdatasize() function shall set the maximum
       allowed size, in bytes, in the max-data-size attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument, using the size
       value supplied by the maxdatasize argument. This maximum size is the
       maximum allowed size for the user data argument which may be passed
       to posix_trace_event().  The implementation shall be allowed to
       truncate data passed to trace_user_event which is longer than
       maxdatasize.
       The posix_trace_attr_setstreamsize() function shall set the minimum
       allowed size, in bytes, in the stream-min-size attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument, using the size
       value supplied by the streamsize argument.
