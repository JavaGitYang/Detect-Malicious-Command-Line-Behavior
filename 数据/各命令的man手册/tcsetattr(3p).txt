       The tcsetattr() function shall set the parameters associated with the
       terminal referred to by the open file descriptor fildes (an open file
       descriptor associated with a terminal) from the termios structure
       referenced by termios_p as follows:
        *  If optional_actions is TCSANOW, the change shall occur
           immediately.
        *  If optional_actions is TCSADRAIN, the change shall occur after
           all output written to fildes is transmitted. This function should
           be used when changing parameters that affect output.
        *  If optional_actions is TCSAFLUSH, the change shall occur after
           all output written to fildes is transmitted, and all input so far
           received but not read shall be discarded before the change is
           made.
       If the output baud rate stored in the termios structure pointed to by
       termios_p is the zero baud rate, B0, the modem control lines shall no
       longer be asserted. Normally, this shall disconnect the line.
       If the input baud rate stored in the termios structure pointed to by
       termios_p is 0, the input baud rate given to the hardware is the same
       as the output baud rate stored in the termios structure.
       The tcsetattr() function shall return successfully if it was able to
       perform any of the requested actions, even if some of the requested
       actions could not be performed. It shall set all the attributes that
       the implementation supports as requested and leave all the attributes
       not supported by the implementation unchanged. If no part of the
       request can be honored, it shall return −1 and set errno to [EINVAL].
       If the input and output baud rates differ and are a combination that
       is not supported, neither baud rate shall be changed. A subsequent
       call to tcgetattr() shall return the actual state of the terminal
       device (reflecting both the changes made and not made in the previous
       tcsetattr() call). The tcsetattr() function shall not change the
       values found in the termios structure under any circumstances.
       The effect of tcsetattr() is undefined if the value of the termios
       structure pointed to by termios_p was not derived from the result of
       a call to tcgetattr() on fildes; an application should modify only
       fields and flags defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 between the
       call to tcgetattr() and tcsetattr(), leaving all other fields and
       flags unmodified.
       No actions defined by this volume of POSIX.1‐2008, other than a call
       to tcsetattr(), a close of the last file descriptor in the system
       associated with this terminal device, or an open of the first file
       descriptor in the system associated with this terminal device (using
       the O_TTY_INIT flag if it is non-zero and the device is not a pseudo-
       terminal), shall cause any of the terminal attributes defined by this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008 to change.
       If tcsetattr() is called from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal:
        *  If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process
           is ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the operation completes normally and
           no signal is sent.
        *  Otherwise, a SIGTTOU signal shall be sent to the process group.
