       The sigwait() function suspends execution of the calling thread until
       one of the signals specified in the signal set set becomes pending.
       The function accepts the signal (removes it from the pending list of
       signals), and returns the signal number in sig.
       The operation of sigwait() is the same as sigwaitinfo(2), except
       that:
       * sigwait() returns only the signal number, rather than a siginfo_t
         structure describing the signal.
       * The return values of the two functions are different.
