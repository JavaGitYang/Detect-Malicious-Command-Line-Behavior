       If the process has a controlling terminal, tcsetpgrp() shall set the
       foreground process group ID associated with the terminal to pgid_id.
       The application shall ensure that the file associated with fildes is
       the controlling terminal of the calling process and the controlling
       terminal is currently associated with the session of the calling
       process. The application shall ensure that the value of pgid_id
       matches a process group ID of a process in the same session as the
       calling process.
       Attempts to use tcsetpgrp() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
       ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
       operation, and no signal is sent.
