       The Audit Logging overlay can be used to record all changes on a
       given backend database to a specified log file. Changes are logged as
       standard LDIF, with an additional comment header giving the timestamp
       of the change and the identity of the user making the change.
       For Add and Modify operations the identity comes from the
       modifiersName associated with the operation. This is usually the same
       as the requestor's identity, but may be set by other overlays to
       reflect other values.
