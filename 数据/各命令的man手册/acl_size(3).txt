     The acl_size() function return the size, in bytes, of the buffer
     required to hold the exportable, contiguous, persistent form of the ACL
     pointed to by the argument acl, when converted by acl_copy_ext().
     Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in acl con‚Äê
     tinue to refer to the same entries. Any existing ACL pointers that
     refer to the ACL referred to by acl continue to refer to the ACL. The
     order of ACL entries within acl remains unchanged.
