       __pmConvertTime accepts a tm structure that has been filled in by
       __pmParseCtime(3) and a reference time point origin, and fills in the
       given rslt structure with the time the user meant when he specified a
       partial ctime or positive or negative time interval.
       Typically, the argument origin is the start time for a set of  PCP
       archive logs, unless the user specified a negative interval offset,
       in which case it is the end time of the log.
       __pmConvertTime returns 0 if successful.  It returns -1 and writes an
       error message to stderr, if an error is detected.
       Use pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or pmUseZone(3) to establish a
       new current timezone that will effect __pmConvertTime.
