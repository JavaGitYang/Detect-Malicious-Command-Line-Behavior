       pam_permit is a PAM module that always permit access. It does nothing
       else.
       In the case of authentication, the user's name will be set to nobody
       if the application didn't set one. Many applications and PAM modules
       become confused if this name is unknown.
       This module is very dangerous. It should be used with extreme
       caution.
