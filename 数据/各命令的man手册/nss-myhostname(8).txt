       nss-myhostname is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch
       (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc), primarily providing
       hostname resolution for the locally configured system hostname as
       returned by gethostname(2). The precise hostnames resolved by this
       module are:
       ·   The local, configured hostname is resolved to all locally
           configured IP addresses ordered by their scope, or — if none are
           configured — the IPv4 address 127.0.0.2 (which is on the local
           loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).
       ·   The hostnames "localhost" and "localhost.localdomain" (as well as
           any hostname ending in ".localhost" or ".localhost.localdomain")
           are resolved to the IP addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.
       ·   The hostname "gateway" is resolved to all current default routing
           gateway addresses, ordered by their metric. This assigns a stable
           hostname to the current gateway, useful for referencing it
           independently of the current network configuration state.
       Various software relies on an always-resolvable local hostname. When
       using dynamic hostnames, this is traditionally achieved by patching
       /etc/hosts at the same time as changing the hostname. This is
       problematic since it requires a writable /etc file system and is
       fragile because the file might be edited by the administrator at the
       same time. With nss-myhostname enabled, changing /etc/hosts is
       unnecessary, and on many systems, the file becomes entirely optional.
       To activate the NSS modules, add "myhostname" to the line starting
       with "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
       It is recommended to place "myhostname" last in the nsswitch.conf'
       "hosts:" line to make sure that this mapping is only used as
       fallback, and that any DNS or /etc/hosts based mapping takes
       precedence.
