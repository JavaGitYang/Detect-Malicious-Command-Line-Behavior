       sepol_check_context checks the validity of a security context against
       a binary policy previously loaded from a file via
       sepol_set_policydb_from_file.  It is used by setfiles -c to validate
       a file contexts configuration against the binary policy upon policy
       builds.  For validating a context against the active policy on a
       SELinux system, use security_check_context from libselinux instead.
