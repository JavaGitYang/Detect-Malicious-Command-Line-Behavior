       dh_missing compares the list of installed files with the files in the
       source directory. If any of the files (and symlinks) in the source
       directory were not installed to somewhere, it will warn on stderr
       about that (--list-missing) or fail (--fail-missing).  Please note
       that without either of these options, dh_missing will silently do
       nothing.
       This may be useful if you have a large package and want to make sure
       that you don't miss installing newly added files in new upstream
       releases.
       Remember to test different kinds of builds (dpkg-buildpackage
       -A/-B/...) as you may experience varying results when only a subset
       of the packages are built.
