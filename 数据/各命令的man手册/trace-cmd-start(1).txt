       The trace-cmd(1) start enables all the Ftrace tracing the same way
       trace-cmd-record(1) does. The difference is that it does not run
       threads to create a trace.dat file. This is useful just to enable
       Ftrace and you are only interested in the trace after some event has
       occurred and the trace is stopped. Then the trace can be read
       straight from the Ftrace pseudo file system or can be extracted with
       trace-cmd-extract(1).
