       ip tcp_metrics is used to manipulate entries in the kernel that keep
       TCP information for IPv4 and IPv6 destinations. The entries are
       created when TCP sockets want to share information for destinations
       and are stored in a cache keyed by the destination address. The saved
       information may include values for metrics (initially obtained from
       routes), recent TSVAL for TIME-WAIT recycling purposes, state for the
       Fast Open feature, etc.  For performance reasons the cache can not
       grow above configured limit and the older entries are replaced with
       fresh information, sometimes reclaimed and used for new destinations.
       The kernel never removes entries, they can be flushed only with this
       tool.
   ip tcp_metrics show - show cached entries
       address PREFIX (default)
              IPv4/IPv6 prefix or address. If no prefix is provided all
              entries are shown.
       The output may contain the following information:
       age <S.MMM>sec - time after the entry was created, reset or updated
       with metrics from sockets. The entry is reset and refreshed on use
       with metrics from route if the metrics are not updated in last hour.
       Not all cached values reset the age on update.
       cwnd <N> - CWND metric value
       fo_cookie <HEX-STRING> - Cookie value received in SYN-ACK to be used
       by Fast Open for next SYNs
       fo_mss <N> - MSS value received in SYN-ACK to be used by Fast Open
       for next SYNs
       fo_syn_drops <N>/<S.MMM>sec ago - Number of drops of initial outgoing
       Fast Open SYNs with data detected by monitoring the received SYN-ACK
       after SYN retransmission.  The seconds show the time after last SYN
       drop and together with the drop count can be used to disable Fast
       Open for some time.
       reordering <N> - Reordering metric value
       rtt <N>us - RTT metric value
       rttvar <N>us - RTTVAR metric value
       ssthresh <SSTHRESH> - SSTHRESH metric value
       tw_ts <TSVAL>/<SEC>sec ago - recent TSVAL and the seconds after
       saving it into TIME-WAIT socket
   ip tcp_metrics delete - delete single entry
       address ADDRESS (default)
              IPv4/IPv6 address. The address is a required argument.
   ip tcp_metrics flush - flush entries
       This command flushes the entries selected by some criteria.
       This command has the same arguments as show.
