       Given a Performance Metric Identifier (PMID) via pmid, pmNameID will
       determine the corresponding metric name, if any, in the Performance
       Metrics Name Space (PMNS), and return this via name.
       If the PMNS contains multiple names associated with the requested
       PMID, one of these will be returned via name, but there is no way to
       determine which of the duplicate names this will be.  See
       pmNameAll(3) if all of the corresponding names are required.
       As of Version 3.10.3 of PCP, duplicate names for the same PMID are
       allowed in the PMNS, so using pmNameAll(3) is recommended over
       pmnameID.
       name is a null-byte terminated string, allocated by pmNameID using
       malloc(3) and it is the caller's responsibility to call free(3) to
       release the storage when the value is no longer required.
       In the absence of errors, pmNameID returns zero.
