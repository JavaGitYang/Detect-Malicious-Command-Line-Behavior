       The sched_getscheduler() function shall return the scheduling policy
       of the process specified by pid.  If the value of pid is negative,
       the behavior of the sched_getscheduler() function is unspecified.
       The values that can be returned by sched_getscheduler() are defined
       in the <sched.h> header.
       If a process specified by pid exists, and if the calling process has
       permission, the scheduling policy shall be returned for the process
       whose process ID is equal to pid.
       If pid is zero, the scheduling policy shall be returned for the
       calling process.
