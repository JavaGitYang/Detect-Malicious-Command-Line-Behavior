       For strcoll(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The strcoll() and strcoll_l() functions shall compare the string
       pointed to by s1 to the string pointed to by s2, both interpreted as
       appropriate to the LC_COLLATE category of the current locale, or of
       the locale represented by locale, respectively.
       The strcoll() and strcoll_l() functions shall not change the setting
       of errno if successful.
       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call strcoll(), or strcoll_l() then check errno.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to strcoll_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
