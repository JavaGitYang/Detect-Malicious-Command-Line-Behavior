       This function will sign the certificate with the issuer's private
       key, and will copy the issuer's information into the certificate.
       This must be the last step in a certificate generation since all the
       previously set parameters are now signed.
       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed
       certificate will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature
       verification), until it is exported an re-imported.
       After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  dig may be GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN, and
       in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be
       selected.
