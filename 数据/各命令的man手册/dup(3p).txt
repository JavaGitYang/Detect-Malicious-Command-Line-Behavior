       The dup() function provides an alternative interface to the service
       provided by fcntl() using the F_DUPFD command. The call dup(fildes)
       shall be equivalent to:
           fcntl(fildes, F_DUPFD, 0);
       The dup2() function shall cause the file descriptor fildes2 to refer
       to the same open file description as the file descriptor fildes and
       to share any locks, and shall return fildes2.  If fildes2 is already
       a valid open file descriptor, it shall be closed first, unless fildes
       is equal to fildes2 in which case dup2() shall return fildes2 without
       closing it. If the close operation fails to close fildes2, dup2()
       shall return −1 without changing the open file description to which
       fildes2 refers. If fildes is not a valid file descriptor, dup2()
       shall return −1 and shall not close fildes2.  If fildes2 is less than
       0 or greater than or equal to {OPEN_MAX}, dup2() shall return −1 with
       errno set to [EBADF].
       Upon successful completion, if fildes is not equal to fildes2, the
       FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with fildes2 shall be cleared. If fildes
       is equal to fildes2, the FD_CLOEXEC flag associated with fildes2
       shall not be changed.
       If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the dup2()
       function is unspecified.
