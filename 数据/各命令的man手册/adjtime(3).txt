       The adjtime() function gradually adjusts the system clock (as
       returned by gettimeofday(2)).  The amount of time by which the clock
       is to be adjusted is specified in the structure pointed to by delta.
       This structure has the following form:
           struct timeval {
               time_t      tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               suseconds_t tv_usec;    /* microseconds */
           };
       If the adjustment in delta is positive, then the system clock is
       speeded up by some small percentage (i.e., by adding a small amount
       of time to the clock value in each second) until the adjustment has
       been completed.  If the adjustment in delta is negative, then the
       clock is slowed down in a similar fashion.
       If a clock adjustment from an earlier adjtime() call is already in
       progress at the time of a later adjtime() call, and delta is not NULL
       for the later call, then the earlier adjustment is stopped, but any
       already completed part of that adjustment is not undone.
       If olddelta is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to
       return the amount of time remaining from any previous adjustment that
       has not yet been completed.
