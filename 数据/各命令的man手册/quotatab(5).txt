       The quotatab file lists human descriptions of devices for the purpose
       of warnquota(8) notifications.
       Each line consists of a device path name followed by a colon and a
       description. White space, apostrophe, and double quote characters
       surrounding the names and descriptions will be stripped. The
       description field can encode a new-line as a pipe character.
       Empty lines or lines starting with a hash sign or a semicolon are
       ignored.
