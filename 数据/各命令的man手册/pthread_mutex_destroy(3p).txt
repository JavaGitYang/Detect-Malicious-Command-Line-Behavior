       The pthread_mutex_destroy() function shall destroy the mutex object
       referenced by mutex; the mutex object becomes, in effect,
       uninitialized. An implementation may cause pthread_mutex_destroy() to
       set the object referenced by mutex to an invalid value.
       A destroyed mutex object can be reinitialized using
       pthread_mutex_init(); the results of otherwise referencing the object
       after it has been destroyed are undefined.
       It shall be safe to destroy an initialized mutex that is unlocked.
       Attempting to destroy a locked mutex or a mutex that is referenced
       (for example, while being used in a pthread_cond_timedwait() or
       pthread_cond_wait()) by another thread results in undefined behavior.
       The pthread_mutex_init() function shall initialize the mutex
       referenced by mutex with attributes specified by attr.  If attr is
       NULL, the default mutex attributes are used; the effect shall be the
       same as passing the address of a default mutex attributes object.
       Upon successful initialization, the state of the mutex becomes
       initialized and unlocked.
       Only mutex itself may be used for performing synchronization. The
       result of referring to copies of mutex in calls to
       pthread_mutex_lock(), pthread_mutex_trylock(),
       pthread_mutex_unlock(), and pthread_mutex_destroy() is undefined.
       Attempting to initialize an already initialized mutex results in
       undefined behavior.
       In cases where default mutex attributes are appropriate, the macro
       PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER can be used to initialize mutexes. The
       effect shall be equivalent to dynamic initialization by a call to
       pthread_mutex_init() with parameter attr specified as NULL, except
       that no error checks are performed.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the mutex
       argument to pthread_mutex_destroy() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_mutex_init() does not refer to an initialized mutex
       attributes object.
