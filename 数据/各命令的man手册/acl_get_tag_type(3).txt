     The acl_get_tag_type() function assigns to the value pointed to by
     tag_type_p the tag type for the ACL entry indicated by the argument
     entry_d.
     The argument entry_d and any other ACL entry descriptors that refer to
     entries in the same ACL continue to refer to those entries. The order
     of all existing entries in the ACL remain unchanged.
