       The pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() function shall destroy a read-write
       lock attributes object. A destroyed attr attributes object can be
       reinitialized using pthread_rwlockattr_init(); the results of
       otherwise referencing the object after it has been destroyed are
       undefined. An implementation may cause pthread_rwlockattr_destroy()
       to set the object referenced by attr to an invalid value.
       The pthread_rwlockattr_init() function shall initialize a read-write
       lock attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.
       Results are undefined if pthread_rwlockattr_init() is called
       specifying an already initialized attr attributes object.
       After a read-write lock attributes object has been used to initialize
       one or more read-write locks, any function affecting the attributes
       object (including destruction) shall not affect any previously
       initialized read-write locks.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_rwlockattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized
       read-write lock attributes object.
