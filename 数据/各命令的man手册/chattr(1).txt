       chattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.
       The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[aAcCdDeijPsStTu].
       The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to the
       existing attributes of the files; '-' causes them to be removed; and
       '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the files have.
       The letters 'aAcCdDeijPsStTu' select the new attributes for the
       files: append only (a), no atime updates (A), compressed (c), no copy
       on write (C), no dump (d), synchronous directory updates (D), extent
       format (e), immutable (i), data journalling (j), project hierarchy
       (P), secure deletion (s), synchronous updates (S), no tail-merging
       (t), top of directory hierarchy (T), and undeletable (u).
       The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by
       lsattr(1) but not modified by chattr: encrypted (E), indexed
       directory (I), and inline data (N).
       Not all flags are supported or utilized by all filesystems; refer to
       filesystem-specific man pages such as btrfs(5), ext4(5), and xfs(5)
       for more filesystem-specific details.
