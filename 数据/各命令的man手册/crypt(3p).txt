       The crypt() function is a string encoding function. The algorithm is
       implementation-defined.
       The key argument points to a string to be encoded. The salt argument
       shall be a string of at least two bytes in length not including the
       null character chosen from the set:
           a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z
           A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z
           0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 . /
       The first two bytes of this string may be used to perturb the
       encoding algorithm.
       The return value of crypt() points to static data that is overwritten
       by each call.
       The crypt() function need not be thread-safe.
