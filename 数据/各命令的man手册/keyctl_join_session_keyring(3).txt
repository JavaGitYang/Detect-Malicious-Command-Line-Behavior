       keyctl_join_session_keyring() changes the session keyring to which a
       process is subscribed.
       If name is NULL then a new anonymous keyring will be created, and the
       process will be subscribed to that.
       If name points to a string, then if a keyring of that name is
       available, the process will attempt to subscribe to that keyring,
       giving an error if that is not permitted; otherwise a new keyring of
       that name is created and attached as the session keyring.
       To attach to an extant named keyring, the keyring must have search
       permission available to the calling process.
