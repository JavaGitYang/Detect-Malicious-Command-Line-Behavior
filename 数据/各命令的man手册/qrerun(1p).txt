       To rerun a batch job is to terminate the session leader of the batch
       job, delete any associated checkpoint files, and return the batch job
       to the batch queued state. A batch job is rerun by a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The qrerun utility is a
       user-accessible batch client that requests the rerunning of one or
       more batch jobs.
       The qrerun utility shall rerun those batch jobs for which a batch
       job_identifier is presented to the utility.
       The qrerun utility shall rerun batch jobs in the order in which their
       batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.
       If the qrerun utility fails to process any batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qrerun utility shall rerun batch jobs by sending a Rerun Job
       Request to the batch server that manages each batch job.
       For each successfully processed batch job_identifier, the qrerun
       utility shall have rerun the corresponding batch job at the time the
       utility exits.
