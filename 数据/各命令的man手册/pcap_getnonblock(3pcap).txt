       pcap_setnonblock() puts a capture handle into ``non-blocking'' mode,
       or takes it out of ``non-blocking'' mode, depending on whether the
       nonblock argument is non-zero or zero.  It has no effect on
       ``savefiles''.  If there is an error, -1 is returned and errbuf is
       filled in with an appropriate error message; otherwise, 0 is
       returned.  In ``non-blocking'' mode, an attempt to read from the
       capture descriptor with pcap_dispatch() will, if no packets are
       currently available to be read, return 0 immediately rather than
       blocking waiting for packets to arrive.  pcap_loop() and pcap_next()
       will not work in ``non-blocking'' mode.
       When first activated with pcap_activate() or opened with
       pcap_open_live() , a capture handle is not in ``non-blocking mode'';
       a call to pcap_setnonblock() is required in order to put it into
       ``non-blocking'' mode.
