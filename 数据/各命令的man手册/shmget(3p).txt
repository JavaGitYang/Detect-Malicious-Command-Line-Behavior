       The shmget() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.342, Shared Memory
       Object).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with
       the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The shmget() function shall return the shared memory identifier
       associated with key.
       A shared memory identifier, associated data structure, and shared
       memory segment of at least size bytes (see <sys/shm.h>) are created
       for key if one of the following is true:
        *  The argument key is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.
        *  The argument key does not already have a shared memory identifier
           associated with it and (shmflg &IPC_CREAT) is non-zero.
       Upon creation, the data structure associated with the new shared
       memory identifier shall be initialized as follows:
        *  The values of shm_perm.cuid, shm_perm.uid, shm_perm.cgid, and
           shm_perm.gid are set to the effective user ID and effective group
           ID, respectively, of the calling process.
        *  The low-order nine bits of shm_perm.mode are set to the low-order
           nine bits of shmflg.
        *  The value of shm_segsz is set to the value of size.
        *  The values of shm_lpid, shm_nattch, shm_atime, and shm_dtime are
           set to 0.
        *  The value of shm_ctime is set to the current time, as described
           in Section 2.7.1, IPC General Description.
       When the shared memory segment is created, it shall be initialized
       with all zero values.
