       keyctl_describe() describes the attributes of a key as a NUL-
       terminated string.
       The caller must have view permission on a key to be able to get a
       description of it.
       buffer and buflen specify the buffer into which the key description
       will be placed.  If the buffer is too small, the full size of the
       description will be returned, and no copy will take place.
       keyctl_describe_alloc() is similar to keyctl_describe() except that
       it allocates a buffer big enough to hold the description and places
       the description in it.  If successful, A pointer to the buffer is
       placed in *_buffer.  The caller must free the buffer.
       The description will be a string of format:
              “%s;%d;%d;%08x;%s”
       where the arguments are: key type name, key UID, key GID, key
       permissions mask and key description.
       NOTE!  The key description will not contain any semicolons, so that
       should be separated out by working backwards from the end of the
       string.  This permits extra information to be inserted before it by
       later versions of the kernel simply by inserting more semicolon-
       terminated substrings.
