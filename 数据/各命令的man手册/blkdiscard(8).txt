       blkdiscard is used to discard device sectors.  This is useful for
       solid-state drivers (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.  Unlike
       fstrim(8), this command is used directly on the block device.
       By default, blkdiscard will discard all blocks on the device.
       Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size,
       as explained below.
       The device argument is the pathname of the block device.
       WARNING: All data in the discarded region on the device will be lost!
