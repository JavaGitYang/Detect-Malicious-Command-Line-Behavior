       This function will sign the given hash using the private key. Do not
       use this function directly unless you know what it is. Typical
       signing requires the data to be hashed and stored in special formats
       (e.g. BER Digest-Info for RSA).
       This API is provided only for backwards compatibility, and thus
       restricted to RSA, DSA and ECDSA key types. For other key types
       please use gnutls_privkey_sign_hash() and gnutls_privkey_sign_data().
