       ldapdelete is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_delete_ext(3)
       library call.
       ldapdelete opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and deletes
       one or more entries.  If one or more DN arguments are provided,
       entries with those Distinguished Names are deleted.  Each DN should
       be provided using the LDAPv3 string representation as defined in RFC
       4514.  If no DN arguments are provided, a list of DNs is read from
       standard input (or from file if the -f flag is used).
