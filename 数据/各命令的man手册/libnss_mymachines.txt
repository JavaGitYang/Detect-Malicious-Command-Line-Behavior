       nss-mymachines is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch
       (NSS) functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc), providing hostname
       resolution for the names of containers running locally that are
       registered with systemd-machined.service(8). The container names are
       resolved to the IP addresses of the specific container, ordered by
       their scope. This functionality only applies to containers using
       network namespacing.
       The module also resolves user and group IDs used by containers to
       user and group names indicating the container name, and back. This
       functionality only applies to containers using user namespacing.
       To activate the NSS module, add "mymachines" to the lines starting
       with "hosts:", "passwd:" and "group:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
       It is recommended to place "mymachines" after the "files" or "compat"
       entry of the /etc/nsswitch.conf lines to make sure that its mappings
       are preferred over other resolvers such as DNS, but so that
       /etc/hosts, /etc/passwd and /etc/group based mappings take
       precedence.
