       Versions of the functions getc(), getchar(), putc(), and putchar()
       respectively named getc_unlocked(), getchar_unlocked(),
       putc_unlocked(), and putchar_unlocked() shall be provided which are
       functionally equivalent to the original versions, with the exception
       that they are not required to be implemented in a thread-safe manner.
       They may only safely be used within a scope protected by flockfile()
       (or ftrylockfile()) and funlockfile().  These functions may safely be
       used in a multi-threaded program if and only if they are called while
       the invoking thread owns the (FILE *) object, as is the case after a
       successful call to the flockfile() or ftrylockfile() functions.
       If getc_unlocked() or putc_unlocked() are implemented as macros they
       may evaluate stream more than once, so the stream argument should
       never be an expression with side-effects.
