       The memchr() function shall locate the first occurrence of c
       (converted to an unsigned char) in the initial n bytes (each
       interpreted as unsigned char) pointed to by s.
       Implementations shall behave as if they read the memory byte by byte
       from the beginning of the bytes pointed to by s and stop at the first
       occurrence of c (if it is found in the initial n bytes).
