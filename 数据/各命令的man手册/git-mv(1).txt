       Move or rename a file, directory or symlink.
           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> <destination>
           git mv [-v] [-f] [-n] [-k] <source> ... <destination directory>
       In the first form, it renames <source>, which must exist and be
       either a file, symlink or directory, to <destination>. In the second
       form, the last argument has to be an existing directory; the given
       sources will be moved into this directory.
       The index is updated after successful completion, but the change must
       still be committed.
