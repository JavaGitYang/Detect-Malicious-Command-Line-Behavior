       The pthread_mutexattr_gettype() and pthread_mutexattr_settype()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the mutex type attribute.
       This attribute is set in the type parameter to these functions. The
       default value of the type attribute is PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT.
       The type of mutex is contained in the type attribute of the mutex
       attributes. Valid mutex types include:
              PTHREAD_MUTEX_NORMAL PTHREAD_MUTEX_ERRORCHECK
              PTHREAD_MUTEX_RECURSIVE PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT
       The mutex type affects the behavior of calls which lock and unlock
       the mutex. See pthread_mutex_lock(3p) for details. An implementation
       may map PTHREAD_MUTEX_DEFAULT to one of the other mutex types.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_mutexattr_gettype() or pthread_mutexattr_settype() does
       not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.
