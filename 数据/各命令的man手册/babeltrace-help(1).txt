       The help command prints the details and help text of either the
       plugin PLUGIN or the specific component class TYPE.PLUGIN.COMPCLS.
       See babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace project
       and its core concepts.
       The available values for TYPE are:
       source or src
           Source component class.
       filter or flt
           Filter component class.
       sink
           Sink component class.
       See EXAMPLES for usage examples.
   Plugin path
       This command loads Babeltrace plugins to perform its operation. The
       search path for Babeltrace plugins is, in this order:
        1. The colon-separated list of directories in the
           BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
        2. The colon-separated list of directories in the --plugin-path
           option.
        3. If the --omit-home-plugin-path option is absent:
           $HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
        4. If the --omit-system-plugin-path option is absent:
           /usr/local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
       You can use the babeltrace-list-plugins(1) command to dynamically
       list the available plugins.
