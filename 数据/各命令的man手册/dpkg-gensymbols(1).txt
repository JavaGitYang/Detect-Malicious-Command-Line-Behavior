       dpkg-gensymbols scans a temporary build tree (debian/tmp by default)
       looking for libraries and generates a symbols file describing them.
       This file, if non-empty, is then installed in the DEBIAN subdirectory
       of the build tree so that it ends up included in the control
       information of the package.
       When generating those files, it uses as input some symbols files
       provided by the maintainer. It looks for the following files (and
       uses the first that is found):
       路   debian/package.symbols.arch
       路   debian/symbols.arch
       路   debian/package.symbols
       路   debian/symbols
       The main interest of those files is to provide the minimal version
       associated to each symbol provided by the libraries. Usually it
       corresponds to the first version of that package that provided the
       symbol, but it can be manually incremented by the maintainer if the
       ABI of the symbol is extended without breaking backwards
       compatibility. It's the responsibility of the maintainer to keep
       those files up-to-date and accurate, but dpkg-gensymbols helps with
       that.
       When the generated symbols files differ from the maintainer supplied
       one, dpkg-gensymbols will print a diff between the two versions.
       Furthermore if the difference is too significant, it will even fail
       (you can customize how much difference you can tolerate, see the -c
       option).
