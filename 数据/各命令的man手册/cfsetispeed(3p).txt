       The cfsetispeed() function shall set the input baud rate stored in
       the structure pointed to by termios_p to speed.
       There shall be no effect on the baud rates set in the hardware until
       a subsequent successful call to tcsetattr() with the same termios
       structure. Similarly, errors resulting from attempts to set baud
       rates not supported by the terminal device need not be detected until
       the tcsetattr() function is called.
