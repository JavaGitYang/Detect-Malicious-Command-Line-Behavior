       The use_default_colors and assume_default_colors functions are
       extensions to the curses library.  They are used with terminals that
       support ISO 6429 color, or equivalent.  These terminals allow the
       application to reset color to an unspecified default value (e.g.,
       with SGR 39 or SGR 49).
       Applications that paint a colored background over the whole screen do
       not take advantage of SGR 39 and SGR 49.  Some applications are
       designed to work with the default background, using colors only for
       text.  For example, there are several implementations of the ls
       program which use colors to denote different file types or
       permissions.  These "color ls" programs do not necessarily modify the
       background color, typically using only the setaf terminfo capability
       to set the foreground color.  Full-screen applications that use
       default colors can achieve similar visual effects.
       The first function, use_default_colors tells the curses library to
       assign terminal default foreground/background colors to color number
       -1. So init_pair(x,COLOR_RED,-1) will initialize pair x as red on
       default background and init_pair(x,-1,COLOR_BLUE) will initialize
       pair x as default foreground on blue.
       The other, assume_default_colors is a refinement which tells which
       colors to paint for color pair 0.  This function recognizes a special
       color number -1, which denotes the default terminal color.
       The following are equivalent:
              use_default_colors();
              assume_default_colors(-1,-1);
       These are ncurses extensions.  For other curses implementations,
       color number -1 does not mean anything, just as for ncurses before a
       successful call of use_default_colors or assume_default_colors.
       Other curses implementations do not allow an application to modify
       color pair 0.  They assume that the background is COLOR_BLACK, but do
       not ensure that the color pair 0 is painted to match the assumption.
       If your application does not use either use_default_colors or
       assume_default_colors ncurses will paint a white foreground (text)
       with black background for color pair 0.
