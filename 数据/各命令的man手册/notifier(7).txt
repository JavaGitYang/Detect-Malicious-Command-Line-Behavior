       The CUPS notifier interface provides a standard method for adding
       support for new event notification methods to CUPS.  Each notifier
       delivers one or more IPP events from the standard input to the
       specified recipient.
       Notifiers MUST read IPP messages from the standard input using the
       ippNew() and ippReadFile() functions and exit on error.  Notifiers
       are encouraged to exit after a suitable period of inactivity, however
       they may exit after reading the first message or stay running until
       an error is seen.  Notifiers inherit the environment and can use the
       logging mechanism documented in filter(7).
