       The lsearch() function shall linearly search the table and return a
       pointer into the table for the matching entry. If the entry does not
       occur, it shall be added at the end of the table. The key argument
       points to the entry to be sought in the table. The base argument
       points to the first element in the table. The width argument is the
       size of an element in bytes. The nelp argument points to an integer
       containing the current number of elements in the table. The integer
       to which nelp points shall be incremented if the entry is added to
       the table. The compar argument points to a comparison function which
       the application shall supply (for example, strcmp()).  It is called
       with two arguments that point to the elements being compared. The
       application shall ensure that the function returns 0 if the elements
       are equal, and non-zero otherwise.
       The lfind() function shall be equivalent to lsearch(), except that if
       the entry is not found, it is not added to the table.  Instead, a
       null pointer is returned.
