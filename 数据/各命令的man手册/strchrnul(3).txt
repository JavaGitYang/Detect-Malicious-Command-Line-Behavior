       The strchr() function returns a pointer to the first occurrence of
       the character c in the string s.
       The strrchr() function returns a pointer to the last occurrence of
       the character c in the string s.
       The strchrnul() function is like strchr() except that if c is not
       found in s, then it returns a pointer to the null byte at the end of
       s, rather than NULL.
       Here "character" means "byte"; these functions do not work with wide
       or multibyte characters.
