       The qsort() function sorts an array with nmemb elements of size size.
       The base argument points to the start of the array.
       The contents of the array are sorted in ascending order according to
       a comparison function pointed to by compar, which is called with two
       arguments that point to the objects being compared.
       The comparison function must return an integer less than, equal to,
       or greater than zero if the first argument is considered to be
       respectively less than, equal to, or greater than the second.  If two
       members compare as equal, their order in the sorted array is
       undefined.
       The qsort_r() function is identical to qsort() except that the
       comparison function compar takes a third argument.  A pointer is
       passed to the comparison function via arg.  In this way, the
       comparison function does not need to use global variables to pass
       through arbitrary arguments, and is therefore reentrant and safe to
       use in threads.
