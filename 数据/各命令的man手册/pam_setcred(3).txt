       The pam_setcred function is used to establish, maintain and delete
       the credentials of a user. It should be called to set the credentials
       after a user has been authenticated and before a session is opened
       for the user (with pam_open_session(3)). The credentials should be
       deleted after the session has been closed (with
       pam_close_session(3)).
       A credential is something that the user possesses. It is some
       property, such as a Kerberos ticket, or a supplementary group
       membership that make up the uniqueness of a given user. On a Linux
       system the user's UID and GID's are credentials too. However, it has
       been decided that these properties (along with the default
       supplementary groups of which the user is a member) are credentials
       that should be set directly by the application and not by PAM. Such
       credentials should be established, by the application, prior to a
       call to this function. For example, initgroups(2) (or equivalent)
       should have been performed.
       Valid flags, any one of which, may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT,
       are:
       PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
           Initialize the credentials for the user.
       PAM_DELETE_CRED
           Delete the user's credentials.
       PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
           Fully reinitialize the user's credentials.
       PAM_REFRESH_CRED
           Extend the lifetime of the existing credentials.
