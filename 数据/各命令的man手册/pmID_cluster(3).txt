       Within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) each metric is assigned a
       unique Performance Metric Identifier (pmID).  Internally a pmID is
       constructed from 3 fields: the domain number (of the associated
       Performance Metrics Domain Agent, or PMDA), the cluster number and
       the item number (the last two are assigned by the PMDA).
       pmID_build constructs a pmID from domain, cluster and item.
       pmID_domain, pmID_cluster and pmID_item return the respective fields
       from pmid.
