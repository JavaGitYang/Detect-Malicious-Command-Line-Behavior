       This manual page describes the GNU version of troff.  It is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  It is functionally compatible
       with UNIX troff, but has many extensions, see groff_diff(7).  Usually
       it should be invoked using the groff(1) command which will also run
       preprocessors and postprocessors in the appropriate order and with
       the appropriate options.
