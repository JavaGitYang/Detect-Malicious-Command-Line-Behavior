       The stap-prep executable prepares the system for systemtap use by
       installing kernel headers, debug symbols and build tools that match
       the currently running kernel or optionally the kernel version given
       by the user.
       The exact behavior of stap-prep may be customized by the distribution
       maintainers. It might for example only give suggestions and not
       actually install the required packages if that is difficult to
       automate.
