       Since the evolution of roff in the 1970s, a whole bunch of filename
       extensions for roff files were used.
       The roff extensions refer to preprocessors or macro packages.  These
       extensions are fixed in all Unix-like operating systems.
       Later on, groff added some more extensions.  This man page is about
       these filename extensions.
