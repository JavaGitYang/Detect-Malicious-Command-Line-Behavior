       The seccomp_syscall_priority() function provides a priority hint to
       the seccomp filter generator in libseccomp such that higher priority
       syscalls are placed earlier in the seccomp filter code so that they
       incur less overhead at the expense of lower priority syscalls.  A
       syscall's priority can be set regardless of if any rules currently
       exist for that syscall; the library will remember the priority and it
       will be assigned to the syscall if and when a rule for that syscall
       is created.
       While it is possible to specify the syscall value directly using the
       standard __NR_syscall values, in order to ensure proper operation
       across multiple architectures it is highly recommended to use the
       SCMP_SYS() macro instead.  See the EXAMPLES section below.
       The priority parameter takes an 8-bit value ranging from 0 - 255; a
       higher value represents a higher priority.
       The filter context ctx is the value returned by the call to
       seccomp_init().
