       This function will remove the current session data from the session
       database.  This will prevent future handshakes reusing these session
       data.  This function should be called if a session was terminated
       abnormally, and before gnutls_deinit() is called.
       Normally gnutls_deinit() will remove abnormally terminated sessions.
