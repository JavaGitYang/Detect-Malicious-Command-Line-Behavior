       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiEnd closes the current context, forcing the trailer
       records to be written to the PCP archive files, and then these files
       are closed.
       In normal operations, an application would include a call to pmiEnd
       at the end of processing for each context created with a call to
       pmiStart(3).
