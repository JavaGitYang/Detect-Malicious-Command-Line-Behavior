       Runs a number of housekeeping tasks within the current repository,
       such as compressing file revisions (to reduce disk space and increase
       performance), removing unreachable objects which may have been
       created from prior invocations of git add, packing refs, pruning
       reflog, rerere metadata or stale working trees.
       Users are encouraged to run this task on a regular basis within each
       repository to maintain good disk space utilization and good operating
       performance.
       Some git commands may automatically run git gc; see the --auto flag
       below for details. If you know what youâ€™re doing and all you want is
       to disable this behavior permanently without further considerations,
       just do:
           $ git config --global gc.auto 0
