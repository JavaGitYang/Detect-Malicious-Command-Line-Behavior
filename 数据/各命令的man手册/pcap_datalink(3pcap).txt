       pcap_datalink() returns the link-layer header type for the live
       capture or ``savefile'' specified by p.
       It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().
       http://www.tcpdump.org/linktypes.html  lists the values
       pcap_datalink() can return and describes the packet formats that
       correspond to those values.
       Do NOT assume that the packets for a given capture or ``savefile``
       will have any given link-layer header type, such as DLT_EN10MB for
       Ethernet.  For example, the "any" device on Linux will have a link-
       layer header type of DLT_LINUX_SLL even if all devices on the system
       at the time the "any" device is opened have some other data link
       type, such as DLT_EN10MB for Ethernet.
