     The acl_from_text() function converts the text form of the ACL referred
     to by buf_p into the internal form of an ACL and returns a pointer to
     the working storage that contains the ACL. The acl_from_text() function
     accepts as input the long text form and short text form of an ACL as
     described in acl(5).
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‚Äê
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_from_text() as an
     argument.
