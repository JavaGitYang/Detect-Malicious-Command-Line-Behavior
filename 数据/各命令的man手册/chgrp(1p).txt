       The chgrp utility shall set the group ID of the file named by each
       file operand to the group ID specified by the group operand.
       For each file operand, or, if the −R option is used, each file
       encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the file
       operands, the chgrp utility shall perform actions equivalent to the
       chown() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, called with the following arguments:
        *  The file operand shall be used as the path argument.
        *  The user ID of the file shall be used as the owner argument.
        *  The specified group ID shall be used as the group argument.
       Unless chgrp is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges, the
       set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be cleared
       upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of
       other file types may be cleared.
