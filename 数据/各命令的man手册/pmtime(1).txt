       pmtime is a graphical user interface for performance monitoring
       applications using the PCP infrastructure and requiring interactive
       time control.
       pmtime is not normally invoked directly by users.  Rather, it is more
       typical for it to be started by client applications (e.g.  pmchart(1)
       and pmval(1)).
       There are two modes of interacting with a pmtime process - live host
       mode, and historical archive mode.  In archive mode the window
       presents time controls suitable for manipulating the archive
       position, allowing full VCR control to move forwards and backwards in
       time at configurable rates and intervals.  In live mode the pmtime
       window contains the simpler time controls suitable for live
       monitoring.
       The arguments to pmtime are as follows:
       -p   port is the port number which pmtime will use for communication
            with its clients (monitoring applications).
       Note that the pmtime window is only made visible when explicitly
       requested.  Multiple client applications can be connected to a single
       pmtime server - when the final client application exits, pmtime will
       also exit.
