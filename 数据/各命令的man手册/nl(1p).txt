       The nl utility shall read lines from the named file or the standard
       input if no file is named and shall reproduce the lines to standard
       output. Lines shall be numbered on the left. Additional functionality
       may be provided in accordance with the command options in effect.
       The nl utility views the text it reads in terms of logical pages.
       Line numbering shall be reset at the start of each logical page. A
       logical page consists of a header, a body, and a footer section.
       Empty sections are valid. Different line numbering options are
       independently available for header, body, and footer (for example, no
       numbering of header and footer lines while numbering blank lines only
       in the body).
       The starts of logical page sections shall be signaled by input lines
       containing nothing but the following delimiter characters:
                             ┌───────────┬────────────┐
                             │   Line    │  Start of  │
                             ├───────────┼────────────┤
                             │\:\:\:     │ Header     │
                             │\:\:       │ Body       │
                             │\:         │ Footer     │
                             └───────────┴────────────┘
       Unless otherwise specified, nl shall assume the text being read is in
       a single logical page body.
