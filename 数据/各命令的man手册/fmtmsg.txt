       The <fmtmsg.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants:
       MM_HARD       Source of the condition is hardware.
       MM_SOFT       Source of the condition is software.
       MM_FIRM       Source of the condition is firmware.
       MM_APPL       Condition detected by application.
       MM_UTIL       Condition detected by utility.
       MM_OPSYS      Condition detected by operating system.
       MM_RECOVER    Recoverable error.
       MM_NRECOV     Non-recoverable error.
       MM_HALT       Error causing application to halt.
       MM_ERROR      Application has encountered a non-fatal fault.
       MM_WARNING    Application has detected unusual non-error condition.
       MM_INFO       Informative message.
       MM_NOSEV      No severity level provided for the message.
       MM_PRINT      Display message on standard error.
       MM_CONSOLE    Display message on system console.
       The table below indicates the null values and identifiers for
       fmtmsg() arguments. The <fmtmsg.h> header shall define the symbolic
       constants in the Identifier column, which shall have the type
       indicated in the Type column:
                   ┌─────────┬────────┬────────────┬────────────┐
                   │Argument │  Type  │ Null-Value │ Identifier │
                   ├─────────┼────────┼────────────┼────────────┤
                   │label    │ char * │ (char*)0   │ MM_NULLLBL │
                   │severity │ int    │ 0          │ MM_NULLSEV │
                   │class    │ long   │ 0L         │ MM_NULLMC  │
                   │text     │ char * │ (char*)0   │ MM_NULLTXT │
                   │action   │ char * │ (char*)0   │ MM_NULLACT │
                   │tag      │ char * │ (char*)0   │ MM_NULLTAG │
                   └─────────┴────────┴────────────┴────────────┘
       The <fmtmsg.h> header shall also define the following symbolic
       constants for use as return values for fmtmsg():
       MM_OK         The function succeeded.
       MM_NOTOK      The function failed completely.
       MM_NOMSG      The function was unable to generate a message on
                     standard error, but otherwise succeeded.
       MM_NOCON      The function was unable to generate a console message,
                     but otherwise succeeded.
       The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
       as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
           int fmtmsg(long, const char *, int,
               const char *, const char *, const char *);
