       nameif renames network interfaces based on mac addresses. When no
       arguments are given /etc/mactab is read. Each line  of it contains an
       interface name and a Ethernet MAC address. Comments are allowed
       starting with #.  Otherwise the interfaces specified on the command
       line are processed.  nameif looks for the interface with the given
       MAC address and renames it to the name given.
       When the -s argument is given all error messages go to the syslog.
       When the -c argument is given with a file name that file is read
       instead of /etc/mactab.
