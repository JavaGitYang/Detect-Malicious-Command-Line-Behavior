       These routines insert a character string (as many characters as will
       fit on the line) before the character under the cursor.  All
       characters to the right of the cursor are shifted right with the
       possibility of the rightmost characters on the line being lost.  The
       cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if specified).
       The functions with n as the last argument insert a leading substring
       of at most n characters.  If n<=0, then the entire string is
       inserted.
       Special characters are handled as in addch.
