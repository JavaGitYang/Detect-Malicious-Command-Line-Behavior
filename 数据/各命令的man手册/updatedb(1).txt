       This manual page documents the GNU version of updatedb, which updates
       file name databases used by GNU locate.  The file name databases
       contain lists of files that were in particular directory trees when
       the databases were last updated.  The file name of the default
       database is determined when locate and updatedb are configured and
       installed.  The frequency with which the databases are updated and
       the directories for which they contain entries depend on how often
       updatedb is run, and with which arguments.
       In networked environments, it often makes sense to build a database
       at the root of each filesystem, containing the entries for that
       filesystem.  updatedb is then run for each filesystem on the
       fileserver where that filesystem is on a local disk, to prevent
       thrashing the network.  Users can select which databases locate
       searches using an environment variable or command line option; see
       locate(1).  Databases cannot be concatenated together.
       The @samp{LOCATGE02} database format was introduced in GNU findutils
       version 4.0 in order to allow machines with different byte orderings
       to share the databases.  GNU locate can read both the old and
       @samp{LOCATE02} database formats, though support for the old pre-4.0
       database format will be removed shortly.
