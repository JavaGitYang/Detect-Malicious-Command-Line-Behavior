       This function builds a set of character tables for character values
       less than 256. These can be passed to pcre[16|32]_compile() to
       override PCRE's internal, built-in tables (which were made by
       pcre[16|32]_maketables() when PCRE was compiled). You might want to
       do this if you are using a non-standard locale. The function yields a
       pointer to the tables.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
