       This function will initialize and set values to an object list by
       using all objects identified by a PKCS 11 URL.
       This function will enumerate all the objects specified by the PKCS11
       URL provided. It expects an already allocated  p_list which has *
       n_list elements, and that value will be updated to the actual number
       of present objects. The
        p_list objects will be initialized and set by this function.  To
       obtain a list of all available objects use a  url of 'pkcs11:'.
       All returned objects must be deinitialized using
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_deinit().
       The supported in this function  flags are
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN, GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_LOGIN_SO,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRESENT_IN_TRUSTED_MODULE,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_CRT, GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PUBKEY,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_PRIVKEY, GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_WITH_PRIVKEY,
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_CA, GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_MARK_TRUSTED,
       and since 3.5.1 the GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT.
       On versions of GnuTLS prior to 3.4.0 the equivalent function was
       gnutls_pkcs11_obj_list_import_url(). That is also available on this
       version as a macro which maps to this function.
