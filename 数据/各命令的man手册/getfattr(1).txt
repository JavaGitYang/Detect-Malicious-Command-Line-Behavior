       For each file, getfattr displays the file name, and the set of
       extended attribute names (and optionally values) which are associated
       with that file. Per default only attributes in the user namespace are
       displayed, see -m.
       The output format of getfattr -d is as follows:
               1:  # file: somedir/
               2:  user.name0="value0"
               3:  user.name1="value1"
               4:  user.name2="value2"
               5:  ...
       Line 1 identifies the file name for which the following lines are
       being reported.  The remaining lines (lines 2 to 4 above) show the
       name and value pairs associated with the specified file.
