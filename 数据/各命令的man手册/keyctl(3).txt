       The keyctl() system call is a multiplexor for a number of key
       management functions.  These should be called via the wrappers in the
       libkeyutils library.
       The functions can be compiled in by including the keyutils header
       file:
              #include <keyutils.h>
       and then telling the linker it should link in the library:
              -lkeyutils
