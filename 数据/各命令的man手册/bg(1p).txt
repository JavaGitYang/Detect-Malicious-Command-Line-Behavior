       If job control is enabled (see the description of set âˆ’m), the bg
       utility shall resume suspended jobs from the current environment (see
       Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment) by running them as
       background jobs. If the job specified by job_id is already a running
       background job, the bg utility shall have no effect and shall exit
       successfully.
       Using bg to place a job into the background shall cause its process
       ID to become ``known in the current shell execution environment'', as
       if it had been started as an asynchronous list; see Section 2.9.3.1,
       Examples.
