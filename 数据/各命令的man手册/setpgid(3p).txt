       The setpgid() function shall either join an existing process group or
       create a new process group within the session of the calling process.
       The process group ID of a session leader shall not change.
       Upon successful completion, the process group ID of the process with
       a process ID that matches pid shall be set to pgid.
       As a special case, if pid is 0, the process ID of the calling process
       shall be used. Also, if pgid is 0, the process ID of the indicated
       process shall be used.
