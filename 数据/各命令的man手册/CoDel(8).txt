       CoDel (pronounced "coddle") is an adaptive "no-knobs" active queue
       management algorithm (AQM) scheme that was developed to address the
       shortcomings of RED and its variants. It was developed with the
       following goals in mind:
        o It should be parameterless.
        o It should keep delays low while permitting bursts of traffic.
        o It should control delay.
        o It should adapt dynamically to changing link rates with no impact
       on utilization.
        o It should be simple and efficient and should scale from simple to
       complex routers.
