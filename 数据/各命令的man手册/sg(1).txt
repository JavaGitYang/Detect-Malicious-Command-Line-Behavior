       The sg command works similar to newgrp but accepts a command. The
       command will be executed with the /bin/sh shell. With most shells you
       may run sg from, you need to enclose multi-word commands in quotes.
       Another difference between newgrp and sg is that some shells treat
       newgrp specially, replacing themselves with a new instance of a shell
       that newgrp creates. This doesn't happen with sg, so upon exit from a
       sg command you are returned to your previous group ID.
