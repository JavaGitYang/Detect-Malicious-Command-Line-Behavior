       Within the libraries and applications of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP) there is an extensive set of debugging options that may be
       enabled or disabled at run-time.
       Both pmSetDebug and pmClearDebug parse spec assuming it to be a comma
       separated list of PCP debug option names.
       The names of the available options may be found using the -l argument
       to pmdbg(1).
       As a special case, the name ``all'' is treated as a synonym for
       identifying all option names.
       pmSetDebug will set the corresponding options, while pmClearDebug
       will clear the corresponding options.
       Consecutive calls to either routine will be additive.  For example
       the following code fragments are equivalent in terms of the final
       configuration of the debug options.
            sts = pmClearDebug("all");
            sts = pmSetDebug("appl0");
            sts = pmSetDebug("pdu,fetch");
            sts = pmSetDebug("fetch,profile,context");
            sts = pmClearDebug("appl0");
            sts = pmClearDebug("all");
            sts = pmSetDebug("pdu,fetch,profile,context");
       An earlier implementation of the PCP debug facilities used a bit-
       vector and for backwards compatibility the elements of spec may
       include decimal values corresponding to those bit-values.  Refer to
       pmdbg(1) for more details of this deprecated format.
