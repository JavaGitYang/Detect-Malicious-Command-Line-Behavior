       pmdagfs2 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values about mounted GFS2 filesystems from the debugfs
       filesystem.  This PMDA requires debugfs along with at least one
       mounted GFS2 filesystem to be mounted in order to be able to provide
       metric data.
       This PMDA can be used with GFS2 filesystems which are both mounted as
       local filesystems and filesystems which are  mounted as shared
       storage within a clustered environment. However there are some
       metrics which specifically require GFS2 to be setup in a clustered
       environment to be able to provide metric data. This is due to them
       expecting locking messages to be passed via the distributed lock
       manager (DLM) between nodes of a cluster in order to generate their
       output.
       These cluster-environment-only metrics can be distinguished by the
       inclusion of their corresponding control metrics so that they can be
       optionally enabled or disabled on systems where they are not desired
       to be monitored or not supported.
       pmstore(3) can be used to assign values to these control metrics in
       order to enable (1) or disable (0) them.  This mechanism is also
       useful on distributions that do not currently have full support for
       the GFS2 trace-points or provide older versions of the GFS2 driver.
