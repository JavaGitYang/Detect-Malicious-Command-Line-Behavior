       This function will return a unique ID that depends on the public key
       parameters.  This ID can be used in checking whether a certificate
       corresponds to the given private key.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *
       output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned.  The output will normally be a SHA-1 hash output, which is
       20 bytes.
