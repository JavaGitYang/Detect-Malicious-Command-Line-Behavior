       Floating point numbers can have special values, such as infinite or
       NaN.  With the macro fpclassify(x) you can find out what type x is.
       The macro takes any floating-point expression as argument.  The
       result is one of the following values:
       FP_NAN        x is "Not a Number".
       FP_INFINITE   x is either positive infinity or negative infinity.
       FP_ZERO       x is zero.
       FP_SUBNORMAL  x is too small to be represented in normalized format.
       FP_NORMAL     if nothing of the above is correct then it must be a
                     normal floating-point number.
       The other macros provide a short answer to some standard questions.
       isfinite(x)   returns a nonzero value if
                     (fpclassify(x) != FP_NAN && fpclassify(x) !=
                     FP_INFINITE)
       isnormal(x)   returns a nonzero value if (fpclassify(x) == FP_NORMAL)
       isnan(x)      returns a nonzero value if (fpclassify(x) == FP_NAN)
       isinf(x)      returns 1 if x is positive infinity, and -1 if x is
                     negative infinity.
