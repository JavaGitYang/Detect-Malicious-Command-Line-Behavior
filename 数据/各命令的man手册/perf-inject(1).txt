       perf-inject reads a perf-record event stream and repipes it to
       stdout. At any point the processing code can inject other events into
       the event stream - in this case build-ids (-b option) are read and
       injected as needed into the event stream.
       Build-ids are just the first user of perf-inject - potentially
       anything that needs userspace processing to augment the events stream
       with additional information could make use of this facility.
