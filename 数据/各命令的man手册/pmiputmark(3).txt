       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiPutMark writes a <mark> record to the current PCP
       output archive.  This is required when there is a temporal
       discontinuity between the current input source and the next input
       source, if any, and should be called after the final call to
       pmiWrite(3) for the current input.  If there is no next input to be
       processed or no temporal gap between sources, then the <mark> record
       is not required.
       The <mark> record is used to signify a temporal gap, so that when
       replaying the output PCP archive, interpolation of metric values
       should not be performed between the last timestamp in the current
       input source to the first timestamp in the next input source, i.e.
       across the <mark> record.
