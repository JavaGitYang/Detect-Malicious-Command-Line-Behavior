       The putgrent() function is the counterpart for fgetgrent(3).  The
       function writes the content of the provided struct group into the
       stream.  The list of group members must be NULL-terminated or NULL-
       initialized.
       The struct group is defined as follows:
           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;      /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;    /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;       /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;       /* group members */
           };
