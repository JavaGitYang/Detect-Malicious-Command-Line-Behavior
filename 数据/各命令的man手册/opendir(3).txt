       The opendir() function opens a directory stream corresponding to the
       directory name, and returns a pointer to the directory stream.  The
       stream is positioned at the first entry in the directory.
       The fdopendir() function is like opendir(), but returns a directory
       stream for the directory referred to by the open file descriptor fd.
       After a successful call to fdopendir(), fd is used internally by the
       implementation, and should not otherwise be used by the application.
