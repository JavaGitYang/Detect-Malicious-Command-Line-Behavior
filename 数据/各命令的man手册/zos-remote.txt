       zos-remote.conf controls the configuration for the
       audispd-zos-remote(8) Audit dispatcher plugin. The default location
       for this file is /etc/audisp/zos-remote.conf, however, a different
       file can be specified as the first argument to the audispd-zos-remote
       plugin. See audispd-zos-remote(8) and auditd(8).  The options
       available are as follows:
       server This is the IBM z/OS ITDS server hostname or IP address
       port   The port number where ITDS is running on the z/OS server.
              Default is 389 (ldap port)
       user   The z/OS RACF user ID which the audispd-zos-remote plugin will
              use to perform Remote Audit requests. This user needs READ
              access to FACILITY Class resource IRR.LDAP.REMOTE.AUDIT (See
              audispd-zos-remote(8)).
       password
              The password associated the the z/OS user ID configured above.
       timeout
              The number in seconds that audispd-zos-remote plugin will wait
              before giving up in connection attempts and event submissions.
              The default value is 15
       q_depth
              The audispd-zos-remote plugin will queue inputed events to the
              maximum of q_depth events while trying to submit those
              remotely. This can handle burst of events or in case of a slow
              network connection. However, the audispd-zos-remote plugin
              will drop events in case the queue is full. The default queue
              depth is 64 - Increase this value in case you are experiencing
              event drop due to full queue (audispd-zos-remote will log this
              to syslog).
