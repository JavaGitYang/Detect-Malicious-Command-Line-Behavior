       listen() marks the socket referred to by sockfd as a passive socket,
       that is, as a socket that will be used to accept incoming connection
       requests using accept(2).
       The sockfd argument is a file descriptor that refers to a socket of
       type SOCK_STREAM or SOCK_SEQPACKET.
       The backlog argument defines the maximum length to which the queue of
       pending connections for sockfd may grow.  If a connection request
       arrives when the queue is full, the client may receive an error with
       an indication of ECONNREFUSED or, if the underlying protocol supports
       retransmission, the request may be ignored so that a later reattempt
       at connection succeeds.
