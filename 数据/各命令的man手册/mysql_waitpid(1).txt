       mysql_waitpid signals a process to terminate and waits for the
       process to exit. It uses the kill() system call and Unix signals, so
       it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.
       Invoke mysql_waitpid like this:
           shell> mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time
       mysql_waitpid sends signal 0 to the process identified by pid and
       waits up to wait_time seconds for the process to terminate.  pid and
       wait_time must be positive integers.
       If process termination occurs within the wait time or the process
       does not exist, mysql_waitpid returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.
       If the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0, mysql_waitpid()
       uses signal 1 instead.
       mysql_waitpid supports the following options:
       ·   --help, -?, -I
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --verbose, -v
           Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be used and
           signal 1 is used instead.
       ·   --version, -V
           Display version information and exit.
