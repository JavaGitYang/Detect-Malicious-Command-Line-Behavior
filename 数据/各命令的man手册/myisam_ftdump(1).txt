       myisam_ftdump displays information about FULLTEXT indexes in MyISAM
       tables. It reads the MyISAM index file directly, so it must be run on
       the server host where the table is located. Before using
       myisam_ftdump, be sure to issue a FLUSH TABLES statement first if the
       server is running.
       myisam_ftdump scans and dumps the entire index, which is not
       particularly fast. On the other hand, the distribution of words
       changes infrequently, so it need not be run often.
       Invoke myisam_ftdump like this:
           shell> myisam_ftdump [options] tbl_name index_num
       The tbl_name argument should be the name of a MyISAM table. You can
       also specify a table by naming its index file (the file with the .MYI
       suffix). If you do not invoke myisam_ftdump in the directory where
       the table files are located, the table or index file name must be
       preceded by the path name to the table´s database directory. Index
       numbers begin with 0.
       Example: Suppose that the test database contains a table named
       mytexttablel that has the following definition:
           CREATE TABLE mytexttable
           (
             id   INT NOT NULL,
             txt  TEXT NOT NULL,
             PRIMARY KEY (id),
             FULLTEXT (txt)
           );
       The index on id is index 0 and the FULLTEXT index on txt is index 1.
       If your working directory is the test database directory, invoke
       myisam_ftdump as follows:
           shell> myisam_ftdump mytexttable 1
       If the path name to the test database directory is
       /usr/local/mysql/data/test, you can also specify the table name
       argument using that path name. This is useful if you do not invoke
       myisam_ftdump in the database directory:
           shell> myisam_ftdump /usr/local/mysql/data/test/mytexttable 1
       You can use myisam_ftdump to generate a list of index entries in
       order of frequency of occurrence like this:
           shell> myisam_ftdump -c mytexttable 1 | sort -r
       myisam_ftdump supports the following options:
       ·   --help, -h -?
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --count, -c
           Calculate per-word statistics (counts and global weights).
       ·   --dump, -d
           Dump the index, including data offsets and word weights.
       ·   --length, -l
           Report the length distribution.
       ·   --stats, -s
           Report global index statistics. This is the default operation if
           no other operation is specified.
       ·   --verbose, -v
           Verbose mode. Print more output about what the program does.
