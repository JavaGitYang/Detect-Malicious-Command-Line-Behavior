       The siginterrupt() function changes the restart behavior when a
       system call is interrupted by the signal sig.  If the flag argument
       is false (0), then system calls will be restarted if interrupted by
       the specified signal sig.  This is the default behavior in Linux.
       If the flag argument is true (1) and no data has been transferred,
       then a system call interrupted by the signal sig will return -1 and
       errno will be set to EINTR.
       If the flag argument is true (1) and data transfer has started, then
       the system call will be interrupted and will return the actual amount
       of data transferred.
