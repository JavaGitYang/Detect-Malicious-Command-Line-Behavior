       xfs_ncheck with no -i arguments generates an inode number and
       pathname list of all files on the given filesystem. Names of
       directory files are followed by /..  The output is not sorted in any
       particular order.  The filesystem to be examined is specified by the
       device argument, which should be the disk or volume device for the
       filesystem.  Filesystems stored in files can also be checked, using
       the -f flag.
