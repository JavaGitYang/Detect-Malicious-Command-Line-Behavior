       The tsort utility shall write to standard output a totally ordered
       list of items consistent with a partial ordering of items contained
       in the input.
       The application shall ensure that the input consists of pairs of
       items (non-empty strings) separated by <blank> characters. Pairs of
       different items indicate ordering. Pairs of identical items indicate
       presence, but not ordering.
