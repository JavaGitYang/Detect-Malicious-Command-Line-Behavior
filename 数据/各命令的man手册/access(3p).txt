       The access() function shall check the file named by the pathname
       pointed to by the path argument for accessibility according to the
       bit pattern contained in amode, using the real user ID in place of
       the effective user ID and the real group ID in place of the effective
       group ID.
       The value of amode is either the bitwise-inclusive OR of the access
       permissions to be checked (R_OK, W_OK, X_OK) or the existence test
       (F_OK).
       If any access permissions are checked, each shall be checked
       individually, as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 4.4, File Access Permissions, except that where
       that description refers to execute permission for a process with
       appropriate privileges, an implementation may indicate success for
       X_OK even if execute permission is not granted to any user.
       The faccessat() function shall be equivalent to the access()
       function, except in the case where path specifies a relative path. In
       this case the file whose accessibility is to be determined shall be
       located relative to the directory associated with the file descriptor
       fd instead of the current working directory. If the file descriptor
       was opened without O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether
       directory searches are permitted using the current permissions of the
       directory underlying the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was
       opened with O_SEARCH, the function shall not perform the check.
       If faccessat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to access().
       Values for flag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags
       from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>:
       AT_EACCESS  The checks for accessibility are performed using the
                   effective user and group IDs instead of the real user and
                   group ID as required in a call to access().
