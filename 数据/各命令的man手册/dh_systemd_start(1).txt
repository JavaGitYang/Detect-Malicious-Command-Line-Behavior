       dh_systemd_start is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       starting/stopping or restarting systemd unit files in case no
       corresponding sysv init script is available.
       As with dh_installinit, the unit file is stopped before upgrades and
       started afterwards (unless --restart-after-upgrade is specified, in
       which case it will only be restarted after the upgrade).  This logic
       is not used when there is a corresponding SysV init script because
       invoke-rc.d performs the stop/start/restart in that case.
