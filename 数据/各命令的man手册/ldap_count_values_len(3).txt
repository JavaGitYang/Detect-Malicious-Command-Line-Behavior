       These routines are used to retrieve and manipulate attribute values
       from an LDAP entry as returned by ldap_first_entry(3) or
       ldap_next_entry(3).  ldap_get_values() takes the entry and the
       attribute attr whose values are desired and returns a NULL-terminated
       array of the attribute's values.  attr may be an attribute type as
       returned from ldap_first_attribute(3) or ldap_next_attribute(3), or
       if the attribute type is known it can simply be given.
       The number of values in the array can be counted by calling
       ldap_count_values().  The array of values returned can be freed by
       calling ldap_value_free().
       If the attribute values are binary in nature, and thus not suitable
       to be returned as an array of char *'s, the ldap_get_values_len()
       routine can be used instead.  It takes the same parameters as
       ldap_get_values(), but returns a NULL-terminated array of pointers to
       berval structures, each containing the length of and a pointer to a
       value.
       The number of values in the array can be counted by calling
       ldap_count_values_len().  The array of values returned can be freed
       by calling ldap_value_free_len().
