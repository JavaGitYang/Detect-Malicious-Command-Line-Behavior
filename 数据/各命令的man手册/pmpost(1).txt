       pmpost will append the text message to the end of the Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP) notice board file ($PCP_LOG_DIR/NOTICES) in an atomic
       manner that guards against corruption of the notice board file by
       concurrent invocations of pmpost.
       The PCP notice board is intended to be a persistent store and
       clearing house for important messages relating to the operation of
       the PCP and the notification of performance alerts from pmie(1) when
       other notification options are either unavailable or unsuitable.
       Before being written, messages are prefixed by the current time, and
       when the current day is different to the last time the notice board
       file was written, pmpost will prepend the message with the full date.
       If the notice board file does not exist, pmpost will create it.
       pmpost would usually run from long-running PCP daemons executing
       under the (typically unprivileged) $PCP_USER and $PCP_GROUP accounts.
       The file should be owned by root, and group writable by the
       $PCP_GROUP group.
