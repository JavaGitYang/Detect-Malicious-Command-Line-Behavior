       The grantpt() function changes the mode and owner of the slave
       pseudoterminal device corresponding to the master pseudoterminal
       referred to by fd.  The user ID of the slave is set to the real UID
       of the calling process.  The group ID is set to an unspecified value
       (e.g., tty).  The mode of the slave is set to 0620 (crw--w----).
       The behavior of grantpt() is unspecified if a signal handler is
       installed to catch SIGCHLD signals.
