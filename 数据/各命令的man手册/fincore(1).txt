       fincore counts pages of file contents being resident in memory(in
       core), and reports the numbers.  If an error occurs during counting,
       then an error message is printed to the stderr and fincore continues
       processing the rest of files listed in a command line.
       The default output is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you
       should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using --output columns-list in
       environments where a stable output is required.
