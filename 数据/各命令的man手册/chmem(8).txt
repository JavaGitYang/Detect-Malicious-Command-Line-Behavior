       The chmem command sets a particular size or range of memory online or
       offline.
       ‐ Specify SIZE as <size>[m|M|g|G]. With m or M, <size> specifies the
         memory size in MiB (1024 x 1024 bytes). With g or G, <size>
         specifies the memory size in GiB (1024 x 1024 x 1024 bytes). The
         default unit is MiB.
       ‐ Specify RANGE in the form 0x<start>-0x<end> as shown in the output
         of the lsmem command. <start> is the hexadecimal address of the
         first byte and <end> is the hexadecimal address of the last byte in
         the memory range.
       ‐ Specify BLOCKRANGE in the form <first>-<last> or <block> as shown
         in the output of the lsmem command. <first> is the number of the
         first memory block and <last> is the number of the last memory
         block in the memory range. Alternatively a single block can be
         specified. BLOCKRANGE requires the --blocks option.
       ‐ Specify ZONE as the name of a memory zone, as shown in the output
         of the lsmem -o +ZONES command. The output shows one or more valid
         memory zones for each memory range. If multiple zones are shown,
         then the memory range currently belongs to the first zone. By
         default, chmem will set memory online to the zone Movable, if this
         is among the valid zones. This default can be changed by specifying
         the --zone option with another valid zone.  For memory ballooning,
         it is recommended to select the zone Movable for memory online and
         offline, if possible. Memory in this zone is much more likely to be
         able to be offlined again, but it cannot be used for arbitrary
         kernel allocations, only for migratable pages (e.g. anonymous and
         page cache pages).  Use the --help option to see all available
         zones.
       SIZE and RANGE must be aligned to the Linux memory block size, as
       shown in the output of the lsmem command.
       Setting memory online can fail for various reasons. On virtualized
       systems it can fail if the hypervisor does not have enough memory
       left, for example because memory was overcommitted. Setting memory
       offline can fail if Linux cannot free the memory. If only part of the
       requested memory can be set online or offline, a message tells you
       how much memory was set online or offline instead of the requested
       amount.
       When setting memory online chmem starts with the lowest memory block
       numbers. When setting memory offline chmem starts with the highest
       memory block numbers.
