       pmdalmsensors is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of hardware using
       the lm-sensors on compatible motherboards.
       The lmsensors PMDA exports metrics that measure fan speeds, core
       temperatures and voltage levels.
       A brief description of the pmdalmsensors command line options
       follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            lmsensors.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
            when pmdalmsensors is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  If the
            log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
            to the standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
