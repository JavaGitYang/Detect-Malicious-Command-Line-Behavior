       The rwm overlay to slapd(8) performs basic DN/data rewrite and
       objectClass/attributeType mapping.  Its usage is mostly intended to
       provide virtual views of existing data either remotely, in
       conjunction with the proxy backend described in slapd-ldap(5), or
       locally, in conjunction with the relay backend described in
       slapd-relay(5).
       This overlay is experimental.
