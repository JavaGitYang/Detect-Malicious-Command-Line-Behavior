       The command deallocvt deallocates kernel memory and data structures
       for all unused virtual consoles.  If one or more arguments N ...  are
       given, only the corresponding consoles /dev/ttyN are deallocated.
       A virtual console is unused if it is not the foreground console, and
       no process has it open for reading or writing, and no text has been
       selected on its screen.
