       The pthread_setaffinity_np() function sets the CPU affinity mask of
       the thread thread to the CPU set pointed to by cpuset.  If the call
       is successful, and the thread is not currently running on one of the
       CPUs in cpuset, then it is migrated to one of those CPUs.
       The pthread_getaffinity_np() function returns the CPU affinity mask
       of the thread thread in the buffer pointed to by cpuset.
       For more details on CPU affinity masks, see sched_setaffinity(2).
       For a description of a set of macros that can be used to manipulate
       and inspect CPU sets, see CPU_SET(3).
       The argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the buffer
       pointed to by cpuset.  Typically, this argument would be specified as
       sizeof(cpu_set_t).  (It may be some other value, if using the macros
       described in CPU_SET(3) for dynamically allocating a CPU set.)
