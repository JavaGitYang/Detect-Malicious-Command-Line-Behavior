       pmtrace provides a simple command line interface to the trace
       Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) and the associated pcp_trace
       library.
       The default pmtrace behavior is to provide point trace data to the
       trace PMDA, using the tag argument as the identifying name associated
       with each trace point.  The tag then becomes an instance identifier
       within the set of trace.point metrics.
       The -e option allows an arbitrary command to be executed.  This
       command will be measured as a transaction since it has well defined
       start and end points.  The information is made available through the
       trace.transact metrics.
       Trace data can be sent to the trace PMDA running on host, rather than
       the localhost, using the -h option.  This overrides use of the
       environment variable PCP_TRACE_HOST.
       The -q option suppresses messages from a successful trace, so that
       pmtrace runs quietly.
       The -c option allows an arbitrary counter value to be exported
       through the trace.count metrics, while the -v option allows an
       arbitrary floating point value to be exported through the
       trace.observe metrics
       The -S option enables internal debugging and tracing.  The value of
       state is a bit-wise combination of debug flags as defined in
       pmtracestate(3), and may be specified using the decimal or
       hexadecimal syntax prescribed by strtol(3).
