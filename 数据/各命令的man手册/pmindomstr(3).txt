       For use in error and diagnostic messages, pmInDomStr return a 'human
       readable' version of the specified instance domain identifier.  The
       pmInDomStr_r function does the same, but stores the result in a user-
       supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for at
       least 20 bytes.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       Internally, an instance domain identifier is encoded with two fields:
       domain and serial.
       pmInDomStr returns a string with each of the fields appearing as
       decimal numbers, separated by periods.
       The string value returned by pmInDomStr is held in a single static
       buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the next call to
       pmInDomStr.
