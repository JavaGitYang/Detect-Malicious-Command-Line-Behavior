       The library supports any processor implementing the Intel
       architectural PMU. This is a minimal PMU with a variable number of
       counters but predefined set of events. It is implemented in all
       recent processors  starting with Intel Core Duo/Core Solo.
       It acts as a default PMU support in case the library is run on a very
       recent processor for which the specific support has not yet been
       implemented.
