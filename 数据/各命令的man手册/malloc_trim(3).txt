       The malloc_trim() function attempts to release free memory at the top
       of the heap (by calling sbrk(2) with a suitable argument).
       The pad argument specifies the amount of free space to leave
       untrimmed at the top of the heap.  If this argument is 0, only the
       minimum amount of memory is maintained at the top of the heap (i.e.,
       one page or less).  A nonzero argument can be used to maintain some
       trailing space at the top of the heap in order to allow future
       allocations to be made without having to extend the heap with
       sbrk(2).
