       A package can perform several post-removal actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable postrm file in its control
       archive (i.e. DEBIAN/postrm during package creation).
       The script can be called in the following ways:
       postrm remove
              After the package was removed.
       postrm purge
              After the package was purged.
       old-postrm upgrade new-version
              After the package was upgraded.
       new-postrm failed-upgrade old-version new-version
              If the above upgrade call fails.
       postrm disappear overwriter-package overwriter-version
              After all of the packages files have been replaced.
       new-postrm abort-install
              If preinst fails during install.
       new-postrm abort-install old-version new-version
              If preinst fails during upgrade of removed package.
       new-postrm abort-upgrade old-version new-version
              If preinst fails during upgrade.
