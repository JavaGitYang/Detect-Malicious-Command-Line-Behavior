       dh_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning up
       after a package is built. It removes the package build directories,
       and removes some other files including debian/files, and any detritus
       left behind by other debhelper commands. It also removes common files
       that should not appear in a Debian diff:
         #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp
       It does not run "make clean" to clean up after the build process. Use
       dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like that.
       dh_clean should be the last debhelper command run in the clean target
       in debian/rules.
