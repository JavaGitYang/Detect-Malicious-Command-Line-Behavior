       fdisk is a dialog-driven program for creation and manipulation of
       partition tables.  It understands GPT, MBR, Sun, SGI and BSD
       partition tables.
       Block devices can be divided into one or more logical disks called
       partitions.  This division is recorded in the partition table,
       usually found in sector 0 of the disk.  (In the BSD world one talks
       about `disk slices' and a `disklabel'.)
       All partitioning is driven by device I/O limits (the topology) by
       default.  fdisk is able to optimize the disk layout for a 4K-sector
       size and use an alignment offset on modern devices for MBR and GPT.
       It is always a good idea to follow fdisk's defaults as the default
       values (e.g. first and last partition sectors) and partition sizes
       specified by the +<size>{M,G,...} notation are always aligned
       according to the device properties.
       Note that partx(8) provides a rich interface for scripts to print
       disk layouts, fdisk is mostly designed for humans.  Backward
       compatibility in the output of fdisk is not guaranteed.  The input
       (the commands) should always be backward compatible.
