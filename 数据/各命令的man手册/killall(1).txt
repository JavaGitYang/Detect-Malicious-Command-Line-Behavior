       killall sends a signal to all processes running any of the specified
       commands.  If no signal name is specified, SIGTERM is sent.
       Signals can be specified either by name (e.g.  -HUP or -SIGHUP) or by
       number (e.g.  -1) or by option -s.
       If the command name is not regular expression (option -r) and
       contains a slash (/), processes executing that particular file will
       be selected for killing, independent of their name.
       killall returns a zero return code if at least one process has been
       killed for each listed command, or no commands were listed and at
       least one process matched the -u and -Z search criteria.  killall
       returns non-zero otherwise.
       A killall process never kills itself (but may kill other killall
       processes).
