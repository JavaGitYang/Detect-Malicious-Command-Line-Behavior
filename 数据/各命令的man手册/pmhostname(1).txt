       pmhostname reports the name of the host hostname as returned by
       gethostbyname(3).
       If hostname is not specified, then the local host name is retrieved
       using gethostname(2) and this is than passed to gethostbyname(3).
       pmhostname provides a service for shell scripts that mimics the logic
       formerly used by Performance Co-Pilot applications when trying to
       determine the official name of a host.  PCP applications no longer
       use DNS-based heuristics, and therefore this command is deprecated.
       If gethostbyname(3) fails, the input host name (either hostname or
       the result from calling gethostname(2)) is reported.
