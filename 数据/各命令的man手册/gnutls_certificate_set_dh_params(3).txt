       This function will set the Diffie-Hellman parameters for a
       certificate server to use. These parameters will be used in Ephemeral
       Diffie-Hellman cipher suites.  Note that only a pointer to the
       parameters are stored in the certificate handle, so you must not
       deallocate the parameters before the certificate is deallocated.
