       Reads list of objects from the standard input, and writes either one
       or more packed archives with the specified base-name to disk, or a
       packed archive to the standard output.
       A packed archive is an efficient way to transfer a set of objects
       between two repositories as well as an access efficient archival
       format. In a packed archive, an object is either stored as a
       compressed whole or as a difference from some other object. The
       latter is often called a delta.
       The packed archive format (.pack) is designed to be self-contained so
       that it can be unpacked without any further information. Therefore,
       each object that a delta depends upon must be present within the
       pack.
       A pack index file (.idx) is generated for fast, random access to the
       objects in the pack. Placing both the index file (.idx) and the
       packed archive (.pack) in the pack/ subdirectory of
       $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY (or any of the directories on
       $GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES) enables Git to read from the pack
       archive.
       The git unpack-objects command can read the packed archive and expand
       the objects contained in the pack into "one-file one-object" format;
       this is typically done by the smart-pull commands when a pack is
       created on-the-fly for efficient network transport by their peers.
