       keyctl_search() recursively searches the keyring for a key of the
       specified type and description.
       If found, the key will be attached to the destination keyring (if
       given), and its serial number will be returned.
       The source keyring must grant search permission to the caller, and
       for a key to be found, it must also grant search permission to the
       caller.  Child keyrings will be only be recursively searched if they
       grant search permission to the caller as well.
       If the destination keyring is zero, no attempt will be made to forge
       a link to the key, and just the serial number will be returned.
       If the destination keyring is given, then the link may only be formed
       if the found key grants the caller link permission and the
       destination keyring grants the caller write permission.
       If the search is successful, and if the destination keyring already
       contains a link to a key that matches the specified type and
       description, then that link will be replaced by a link to the found
       key.
       The source keyring and destination keyring serial numbers may be
       those of valid keyrings to which the caller has appropriate
       permission, or they may be special keyring IDs:
       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.
