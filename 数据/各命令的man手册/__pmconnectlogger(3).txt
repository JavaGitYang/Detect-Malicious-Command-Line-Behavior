       Each instance of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logger
       program pmlogger(1) supports a control port on which
       __pmControlLog(3) requests are received, and responses sent.
       Optionally, the pmlogger(1) instance may be designated the
       ``primary'' logger.
       __pmConnectLogger may be used to establish a control port connection
       to the pmlogger(1) instance identified by process id pid on the host
       hostname.
       One special case is supported; for the reserved pid value of
       PM_LOG_CONTROL_PORT the requested connection is to the control port
       for the ``primary'' logger, whatever its process id might be.
       On success, __pmConnectLogger returns a non-negative integer, that is
       a file descriptor that may be used in subsequent communication with
       the pmlogger(1) instance, e.g. for __pmControlLog(3).
       As the control port to pmlogger(1) is not mulitplexed, applications
       using __pmConnectLogger should use close(2) to terminate the
       connection to pmlogger(1) as soon as they have finished
       communicating.
       If the application connects, and the pmlogger(1) instance
       subsequently terminates, e.g. because the associated pmcd(1) instance
       is terminated, the application will have to explicitly re-establish
       connection to a re-started pmlogger(1) instance by calling
       __pmConnectLogger again.
