       The userspace AVC maintains two internal hash tables, one to store
       security ID's and one to cache access decisions.
       avc_av_stats() and avc_sid_stats() produce log messages indicating
       the status of the access decision and SID tables, respectively.  The
       messages contain the number of entries in the table, number of hash
       buckets and number of buckets used, and maximum number of entries in
       a single bucket.
       avc_cache_stats() populates a structure whose fields reflect cache
       activity:
              struct avc_cache_stats {
                  unsigned  entry_lookups;
                  unsigned  entry_hits;
                  unsigned  entry_misses;
                  unsigned  entry_discards;
                  unsigned  cav_lookups;
                  unsigned  cav_hits;
                  unsigned  cav_probes;
                  unsigned  cav_misses;
              };
       entry_lookups
              Number of queries made.
       entry_hits
              Number of times a decision was found in the aeref argument.
       entry_misses
              Number of times a decision was not found in the aeref
              argument.
       entry_discards
              Number of times a decision was not found in the aeref argument
              and the aeref argument was non-NULL.
       cav_lookups
              Number of cache lookups.
       cav_hits
              Number of cache hits.
       cav_misses
              Number of cache misses.
       cav_probes
              Number of entries examined while searching the cache.
