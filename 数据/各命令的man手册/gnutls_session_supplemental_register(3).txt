       This function will register a new supplemental data type (rfc4680).
       The registered supplemental functions will be used for that specific
       session. The provided  type must be an unassigned type in
       gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t.
       If the type is already registered or handled by GnuTLS internally
       GNUTLS_E_ALREADY_REGISTERED will be returned.
