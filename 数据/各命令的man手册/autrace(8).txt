       autrace is a program that will add the audit rules to trace a process
       similar to strace. It will then execute the program passing arguments
       to it. The resulting audit information will be in the audit logs if
       the audit daemon is running or syslog. This command deletes all audit
       rules prior to executing the target program and after executing it.
       As a safety precaution, it will not run unless all rules are deleted
       with auditctl prior to use.
