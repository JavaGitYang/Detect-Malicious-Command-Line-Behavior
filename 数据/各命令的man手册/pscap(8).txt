       pscap is a program that prints out a report of process capabilities.
       If the application has any capabilities, it will be in the report
       with the exception of init. By giving the -a command line option,
       init will be included, too. If a process is not in the report, it has
       dropped all capabilities. If the process has partial capabilities, it
       is further examined to see if it has an open-ended bounding set. If
       this is found to be true, a '+' symbol is added.
