       The showconsolefont command outputs the current console font to
       stdout.  The option -v prints additional information, while the
       option -V prints the program version number.  The option -i doesn't
       print out the font table, just shows ROWSxCOLSxCOUNT and exits.  On
       Linux 2.6.1 and later, the option -C allows one to indicate the
       console involved. Its argument is a pathname.
