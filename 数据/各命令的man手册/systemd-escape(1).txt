       systemd-escape may be used to escape strings for inclusion in systemd
       unit names. The command may be used to escape and to undo escaping of
       strings.
       The command takes any number of strings on the command line, and will
       process them individually, one after another. It will output them
       separated by spaces to stdout.
       By default, this command will escape the strings passed, unless
       --unescape is passed which results in the inverse operation being
       applied. If --mangle is given, a special mode of escaping is applied
       instead, which assumes the string is already escaped but will escape
       everything that appears obviously non-escaped.
