       The pthread_attr_setscope() function sets the contention scope
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in scope.  The contention scope attribute defines the
       set of threads against which a thread competes for resources such as
       the CPU.  POSIX.1 specifies two possible values for scope:
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM
              The thread competes for resources with all other threads in
              all processes on the system that are in the same scheduling
              allocation domain (a group of one or more processors).
              PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM threads are scheduled relative to one
              another according to their scheduling policy and priority.
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
              The thread competes for resources with all other threads in
              the same process that were also created with the
              PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS contention scope.  PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS
              threads are scheduled relative to other threads in the process
              according to their scheduling policy and priority.  POSIX.1
              leaves it unspecified how these threads contend with other
              threads in other process on the system or with other threads
              in the same process that were created with the
              PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM contention scope.
       POSIX.1 requires that an implementation support at least one of these
       contention scopes.  Linux supports PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, but not
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS.
       On systems that support multiple contention scopes, then, in order
       for the parameter setting made by pthread_attr_setscope() to have
       effect when calling pthread_create(3), the caller must use
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) to set the inherit-scheduler
       attribute of the attributes object attr to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.
       The pthread_attr_getscope() function returns the contention scope
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the
       buffer pointed to by scope.
