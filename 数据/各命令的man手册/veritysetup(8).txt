       Veritysetup is used to configure dm-verity managed device-mapper
       mappings.
       Device-mapper verity target provides read-only transparent integrity
       checking of block devices using kernel crypto API.
       The dm-verity devices are always read-only.
       Veritysetup supports these operations:
       format <data_device> <hash_device>
              Calculates and permanently stores hash verification data for
              data_device.  Hash area can be located on the same device
              after data if specified by --hash-offset option.
              Note you need to provide root hash string for device
              verification or activation. Root hash must be trusted.
              The data or hash device argument can be block device or file
              image.  If hash device path doesn't exist, it will be created
              as file.
              <options> can be [--hash, --no-superblock, --format, --data-
              block-size, --hash-block-size, --data-blocks, --hash-offset,
              --salt, --uuid]
       open <data_device> <name> <hash_device> <root_hash> create <name>
       <data_device> <hash_device> <root_hash>
              Creates a mapping with <name> backed by device <data_device>
              and using <hash_device> for in-kernel verification.
              The <root_hash> is a hexadecimal string.
              <options> can be [--hash-offset, --no-superblock, --ignore-
              corruption or --restart-on-corruption, --ignore-zero-blocks,
              --check-at-most-once]
              If option --no-superblock is used, you have to use as the same
              options as in initial format operation.
       verify <data_device> <hash_device> <root_hash>
              Verifies data on data_device with use of hash blocks stored on
              hash_device.
              This command performs userspace verification, no kernel device
              is created.
              The <root_hash> is a hexadecimal string.
              <options> can be [--hash-offset, --no-superblock]
              If option --no-superblock is used, you have to use as the same
              options as in initial format operation.
       close <name>
              Removes existing mapping <name>.
              For backward compatibility there is remove command alias for
              close command.
       status <name>
              Reports status for the active verity mapping <name>.
       dump <hash_device>
              Reports parameters of verity device from on-disk stored
              superblock.
              <options> can be [--no-superblock]
