       capng_lock will take steps to prevent children of the current process
       to regain full privileges if the uid is 0. This should be called
       while possessing the CAP_SETPCAP capability in the kernel. This
       function will do the following if permitted by the kernel: Set the
       NOROOT option on for PR_SET_SECUREBITS, set the NOROOT_LOCKED option
       to on for PR_SET_SECUREBITS, set the PR_NO_SETUID_FIXUP option on for
       PR_SET_SECUREBITS, and set the PR_NO_SETUID_FIXUP_LOCKED option on
       for PR_SET_SECUREBITS.
