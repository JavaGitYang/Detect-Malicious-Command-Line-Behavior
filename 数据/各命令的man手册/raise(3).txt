       The raise() function sends a signal to the calling process or thread.
       In a single-threaded program it is equivalent to
           kill(getpid(), sig);
       In a multithreaded program it is equivalent to
           pthread_kill(pthread_self(), sig);
       If the signal causes a handler to be called, raise() will return only
       after the signal handler has returned.
