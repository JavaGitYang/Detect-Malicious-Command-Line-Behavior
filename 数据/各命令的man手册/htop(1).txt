       Htop is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer for Linux.
       It is similar to top, but allows you to scroll vertically and
       horizontally, so you can see all the processes running on the system,
       along with their full command lines, as well as viewing them as a
       process tree, selecting multiple processes and acting on them all at
       once.
       Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
       entering their PIDs.
