       This command provides a way to interact with p4 repositories using
       Git.
       Create a new Git repository from an existing p4 repository using git
       p4 clone, giving it one or more p4 depot paths. Incorporate new
       commits from p4 changes with git p4 sync. The sync command is also
       used to include new branches from other p4 depot paths. Submit Git
       changes back to p4 using git p4 submit. The command git p4 rebase
       does a sync plus rebases the current branch onto the updated p4
       remote branch.
