       This function sends a ping to the peer. If the  flags is set to
       GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT then it waits for a reply from the peer.
       Note that it is highly recommended to use this function with the flag
       GNUTLS_HEARTBEAT_WAIT, or you need to handle retransmissions and
       timeouts manually.
       The total TLS data transmitted as part of the ping message are given
       by the following formula: MAX(16,  data_size
       )+gnutls_record_overhead_size()+3.
