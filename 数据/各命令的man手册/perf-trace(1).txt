       This command will show the events associated with the target,
       initially syscalls, but other system events like pagefaults, task
       lifetime events, scheduling events, etc.
       This is a live mode tool in addition to working with perf.data files
       like the other perf tools. Files can be generated using the perf
       record command but the session needs to include the raw_syscalls
       events (-e raw_syscalls:*). Alternatively, perf trace record can be
       used as a shortcut to automatically include the raw_syscalls events
       when writing events to a file.
       The following options apply to perf trace; options to perf trace
       record are found in the perf record man page.
