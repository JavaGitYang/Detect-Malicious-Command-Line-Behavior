       /etc/firejail/firejail.users lists the users allowed to run firejail
       SUID executable.  If the file is not present in the system, all users
       are allowed to use the sandbox.  root user is allowed by default.
       Other system users (users with an ID below UID_MIN value defined in
       /etc/login.defs, typically 1000) are not allowed to start the
       sandbox.
       If the user is not allowed to start the sandbox, Firejail will
       attempt to run the program without sandboxing it.
       Example:
            $ cat /etc/firejail/firejail.users
            dustin
            lucas
            mike
            eleven
       Use a text editor to add or remove users from the list. You can also
       use firecfg --add-users command. Example:
            $ sudo firecfg --add-users dustin lucas mike eleven
       By default, running firecfg creates the file and adds the current
       user to the list. Example:
            $ sudo firecfg
       See man 1 firecfg for details.
