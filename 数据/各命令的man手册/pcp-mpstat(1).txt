       The pcp mpstat command writes to standard output activities for each
       available processor, processor 0 being the first one. If no
       activity/option has been selected, then the default report is the CPU
       utilization [ -u ] report.
       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. Default is one second.  The value of count
       parameter determines the number of samples to be displayed.  Default
       is continous.
