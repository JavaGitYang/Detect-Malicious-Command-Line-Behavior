       su allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.
       When called without arguments, su defaults to running an interactive
       shell as root.
       For backward compatibility, su defaults to not change the current
       directory and to only set the environment variables HOME and SHELL
       (plus USER and LOGNAME if the target user is not root).  It is
       recommended to always use the --login option (instead of its shortcut
       -) to avoid side effects caused by mixing environments.
       This version of su uses PAM for authentication, account and session
       management.  Some configuration options found in other su
       implementations, such as support for a wheel group, have to be
       configured via PAM.
       su is mostly designed for unprivileged users, the recommended
       solution for privileged users (e.g. scripts executed by root) is to
       use non-set-user-ID command runuser(1) that does not require
       authentication and provide separate PAM configuration. If the PAM
       session is not required at all then the recommend solution is to use
       command setpriv(1).
