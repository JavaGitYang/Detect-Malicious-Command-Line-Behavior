       lp submits files for printing or alters a pending job.  Use a
       filename of "-" to force printing from the standard input.
   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST
       and PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither
       are set, the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is
       used, followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.
