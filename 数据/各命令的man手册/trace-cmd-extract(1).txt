       The trace-cmd(1) extract is usually used after trace-cmd-start(1) and
       trace-cmd-stop(1). It can be used after the Ftrace tracer has been
       started manually through the Ftrace pseudo file system.
       The extract command creates a trace.dat file that can be used by
       trace-cmd-report(1) to read from. It reads the kernel internal ring
       buffer to produce the trace.dat file.
