       sd_journal_query_unique() queries the journal for all unique values
       the specified field can take. It takes two arguments: the journal to
       query and the field name to look for. Well-known field names are
       listed on systemd.journal-fields(7). Field names must be specified
       without a trailing '='. After this function has been executed
       successfully the field values may be queried using
       sd_journal_enumerate_unique(). Invoking this call a second time will
       change the field name being queried and reset the enumeration index
       to the first field value that matches.
       sd_journal_enumerate_unique() may be used to iterate through all data
       fields which match the previously selected field name as set with
       sd_journal_query_unique(). On each invocation the next field data
       matching the field name is returned. The order of the returned data
       fields is not defined. It takes three arguments: the journal context
       object, plus a pair of pointers to pointer/size variables where the
       data object and its size shall be stored in. The returned data is in
       a read-only memory map and is only valid until the next invocation of
       sd_journal_enumerate_unique(). Note that the data returned will be
       prefixed with the field name and '='. Note that this call is subject
       to the data field size threshold as controlled by
       sd_journal_set_data_threshold().
       sd_journal_restart_unique() resets the data enumeration index to the
       beginning of the list. The next invocation of
       sd_journal_enumerate_unique() will return the first field data
       matching the field name again.
       Note that the SD_JOURNAL_FOREACH_UNIQUE() macro may be used as a
       handy wrapper around sd_journal_restart_unique() and
       sd_journal_enumerate_unique().
       Note that these functions currently are not influenced by matches set
       with sd_journal_add_match() but this might change in a later version
       of this software.
       To enumerate all field names currently in use (and thus all suitable
       field parameters for sd_journal_query_unique()), use the
       sd_journal_enumerate_fields(3) call.
