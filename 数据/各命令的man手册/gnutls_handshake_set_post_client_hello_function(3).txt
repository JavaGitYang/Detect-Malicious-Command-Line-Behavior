       This function will set a callback to be called after the client hello
       has been received (callback valid in server side only). This allows
       the server to adjust settings based on received extensions.
       Those settings could be ciphersuites, requesting certificate, or
       anything else except for version negotiation (this is done before the
       hello message is parsed).
       This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to
       terminate the handshake.
       Since GnuTLS 3.3.5 the callback is allowed to return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN
       or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED to put the handshake on hold. In that case
       gnutls_handshake() will return GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED and can be
       resumed when needed.
