       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaChildren is the generic callback for returning dynamic
       metric names (and their status) that are descendants of name.
       Because implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
       PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a PMDA
       (most PMDAs do not support dynamic performance metrics), pmdaChildren
       is a skeleton implementation that returns PM_ERR_NAME.
       A PMDA that supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a
       private callback that replaces pmdaChildren (by assignment to
       version.four.children of the pmdaInterface structure) and takes the
       initial metric name and returns names via offspring[] and the leaf or
       non-leaf status of each via status[].
       If traverse is 0, then the behaviour is akin to pmGetChildren(3) and
       offspring[] contains the relative name component for the immediate
       descendants of name.
       If traverse is 1, then the behaviour is akin to pmTraversePMNS(3) and
       offspring[] contains the absolute names of all dynamic metrics that
       are decedents of name.
       The resulting list of pointers offspring and the values (the names)
       that the pointers reference will have been allocated by pmdaChildren
       with a single call to malloc(3), and the caller of pmdaChildren will
       call free(offspring) to release the space when it is no longer
       required.  The same holds true for the status array.
