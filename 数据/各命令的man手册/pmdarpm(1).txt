       pmdarpm is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
       performance metrics reflecting the state of the RPM package database
       managed by rpm(1).
       The rpm PMDA exports metrics that describe each package installed on
       a system, as well as some cumulative totals.  When the RPM database
       changes the PMDA automatically detects this and uses a background
       thread to asynchronously refresh its values.
       A brief description of the pmdarpm command line options follows:
       -C   Verify the package iteration code by scanning the RPM database
            once, then exiting.  Only useful for problem diagnosis and
            testing.
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named rpm.log
            is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdarpm is
            started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
       -r   Specify an alternate path to the RPM database (default is
            /var/lib/rpm/Packages).
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account.
