       The pmGetConfig and pmGetOptionalConfig functions search for variable
       first in the environment and then, if not found, in the Performance
       Co-Pilot (PCP) configuration file and returns the string result.  If
       variable is not already in the environment, it is added with a call
       to setenv(3) before returning.
       The pmGetOptionalConfig function allows for failures - either from
       variable not being set at all, or due to the configuration file being
       missing.  pmGetConfig is less tolerant to a missing configuration
       file, which it treats as a critical PCP installation failure - see
       the ``RETURN VALUE'' section below for further details.
       The default location of the PCP configuration file is /etc/pcp.conf
       but this may be changed by setting PCP_CONF in the environment to a
       new location, as described in pcp.conf(5).
       The pmGetAPIConfig function reports on features of the PCP library.
       It can be used to query support for multi-threading, security
       extensions, and other features.
       The pmconfig(1) utility provides command line access to both of these
       interfaces, and also provides a mechanism for listing all available
       variables and features that are valid arguments to these routines.
