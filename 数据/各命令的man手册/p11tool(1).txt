       Program that allows operations on PKCS #11 smart cards and security
       modules.
       To use PKCS #11 tokens with GnuTLS the p11-kit configuration files
       need to be setup.  That is create a .module file in
       /etc/pkcs11/modules with the contents 'module: /path/to/pkcs11.so'.
       Alternatively the configuration file /etc/gnutls/pkcs11.conf has to
       exist and contain a number of lines of the form
       'load=/usr/lib/opensc-pkcs11.so'.
       You can provide the PIN to be used for the PKCS #11 operations with
       the environment variables GNUTLS_PIN and GNUTLS_SO_PIN.
