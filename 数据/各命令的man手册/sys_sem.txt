       The <sys/sem.h> header shall define the following symbolic constant
       for use as a semaphore operation flag:
       SEM_UNDO    Set up adjust on exit entry.
       The <sys/sem.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants
       for use as commands for the semctl() function:
       GETNCNT     Get semncnt.
       GETPID      Get sempid.
       GETVAL      Get semval.
       GETALL      Get all cases of semval.
       GETZCNT     Get semzcnt.
       SETVAL      Set semval.
       SETALL      Set all cases of semval.
       The <sys/sem.h> header shall define the semid_ds structure, which
       shall include the following members:
           struct ipc_perm  sem_perm  Operation permission structure.
           unsigned short   sem_nsems Number of semaphores in set.
           time_t           sem_otime Last semop() time.
           time_t           sem_ctime Last time changed by semctl().
       The <sys/sem.h> header shall define the pid_t, size_t, and time_t
       types as described in <sys/types.h>.
       A semaphore shall be represented by an anonymous structure, which
       shall include the following members:
           unsigned short  semval   Semaphore value.
           pid_t           sempid   Process ID of last operation.
           unsigned short  semncnt  Number of processes waiting for semval
                                    to become greater than current value.
           unsigned short  semzcnt  Number of processes waiting for semval
                                    to become 0.
       The <sys/sem.h> header shall define the sembuf structure, which shall
       include the following members:
           unsigned short  sem_num   Semaphore number.
           short           sem_op    Semaphore operation.
           short           sem_flg   Operation flags.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int   semctl(int, int, int, ...);
           int   semget(key_t, int, int);
           int   semop(int, struct sembuf *, size_t);
       In addition, the <sys/sem.h> header shall include the <sys/ipc.h>
       header.
       The following sections are informative.
