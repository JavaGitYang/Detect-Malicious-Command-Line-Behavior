       The groffer program is the easiest way to use groff(1).  It can
       display arbitrary documents written in the groff language, see
       groff(7), or other roff languages, see roff(7), that are compatible
       to the original troff language.  It finds and runs all necessary
       groff preprocessors, such as chem.
       The groffer program also includes many of the features for finding
       and displaying the Unix manual pages (man pages), such that it can be
       used as a replacement for a man(1) program.  Moreover, compressed
       files that can be handled by gzip(1) or bzip2(1) are decompressed on-
       the-fly.
       The normal usage is quite simple by supplying a file name or name of
       a man page without further options.  But the option handling has many
       possibilities for creating special behaviors.  This can be done ei‐
       ther in configuration files, with the shell environment variable
       $GROFFER_OPT, or on the command line.
       The output can be generated and viewed in several different ways
       available for groff.  This includes the X Window System-based groff
       program gxditview(1), each PostScript, PDF, or DVI display program, a
       web browser by generating HTML or XHTML in www mode, or several
       text modes in text terminals.
       Most of the options that must be named when running groff directly
       are determined automatically for groffer, due to the internal usage
       of the grog(1) program.  But all parts can also be controlled manual‐
       ly by arguments.
       Several file names can be specified on the command-line arguments.
       They are transformed into a single document in the normal way of
       groff.
       Option handling is done in GNU style.  Options and file names can be
       mixed freely.  The option “--” closes the option handling, all fol‐
       lowing arguments are treated as file names.  Long options can be ab‐
       breviated in several ways.
