       pmdalio is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which provides
       for protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.  These allow storage available
       on one host to be exported and consumed by other hosts using industry
       standard protocols.
       This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value
       aggregations and configuration per LIO target instance.  Additional,
       it provides per LUN performance metrics including IOPS, and READ and
       WRITE throughput.
       The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's configfs
       virtual filesystem.  The python-rtslib module provides an interface
       to configfs, allowing tools like pmdalio to interact with the
       settings and metadata held in configfs.
