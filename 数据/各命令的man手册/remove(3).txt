       remove() deletes a name from the filesystem.  It calls unlink(2) for
       files, and rmdir(2) for directories.
       If the removed name was the last link to a file and no processes have
       the file open, the file is deleted and the space it was using is made
       available for reuse.
       If the name was the last link to a file, but any processes still have
       the file open, the file will remain in existence until the last file
       descriptor referring to it is closed.
       If the name referred to a symbolic link, the link is removed.
       If the name referred to a socket, FIFO, or device, the name is
       removed, but processes which have the object open may continue to use
       it.
