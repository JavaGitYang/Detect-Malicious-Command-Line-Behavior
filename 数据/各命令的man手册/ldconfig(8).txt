       ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache to the most recent
       shared libraries found in the directories specified on the command
       line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted directories,
       /lib and /usr/lib (on some 64-bit architectures such as x86-64, /lib
       and /usr/lib are the trusted directories for 32-bit libraries, while
       /lib64 and /usr/lib64 are used for 64-bit libraries).
       The cache is used by the run-time linker, ld.so or ld-linux.so.
       ldconfig checks the header and filenames of the libraries it
       encounters when determining which versions should have their links
       updated.
       ldconfig will attempt to deduce the type of ELF libraries (i.e.,
       libc5 or libc6/glibc) based on what C libraries, if any, the library
       was linked against.
       Some existing libraries do not contain enough information to allow
       the deduction of their type.  Therefore, the /etc/ld.so.conf file
       format allows the specification of an expected type.  This is used
       only for those ELF libraries which we can not work out.  The format
       is "dirname=TYPE", where TYPE can be libc4, libc5, or libc6.  (This
       syntax also works on the command line.)  Spaces are not allowed.
       Also see the -p option.  ldconfig should normally be run by the
       superuser as it may require write permission on some root owned
       directories and files.
