       The posix_trace_event() function shall record the event_id and the
       user data pointed to by data_ptr in the trace stream into which the
       calling process is being traced and in which event_id is not filtered
       out. If the total size of the user trace event data represented by
       data_len is not greater than the declared maximum size for user trace
       event data, then the truncation-status attribute of the trace event
       recorded is POSIX_TRACE_NOT_TRUNCATED.  Otherwise, the user trace
       event data is truncated to this declared maximum size and the
       truncation-status attribute of the trace event recorded is
       POSIX_TRACE_TRUNCATED_RECORD.
       If there is no trace stream created for the process or if the created
       trace stream is not running, or if the trace event specified by
       event_id is filtered out in the trace stream, the posix_trace_event()
       function shall have no effect.
       The posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall associate a user trace
       event name with a trace event type identifier for the calling
       process. The trace event name is the string pointed to by the
       argument event_name.  It shall have a maximum of
       {TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX} characters (which has the minimum value
       {_POSIX_TRACE_EVENT_NAME_MAX}).  The number of user trace event type
       identifiers that can be defined for any given process is limited by
       the maximum value {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}, which has the minimum value
       {POSIX_TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX}.
       If the Trace Inherit option is not supported, the
       posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall associate the user trace
       event name pointed to by the event_name argument with a trace event
       type identifier that is unique for the traced process, and is
       returned in the variable pointed to by the event_id argument. If the
       user trace event name has already been mapped for the traced process,
       then the previously assigned trace event type identifier shall be
       returned. If the per-process user trace event name limit represented
       by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been reached, the pre-defined
       POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (see Table 2-7, Trace Option: User
       Trace Event) user trace event shall be returned.
       If the Trace Inherit option is supported, the
       posix_trace_eventid_open() function shall associate the user trace
       event name pointed to by the event_name argument with a trace event
       type identifier that is unique for all the processes being traced in
       this same trace stream, and is returned in the variable pointed to by
       the event_id argument. If the user trace event name has already been
       mapped for the traced processes, then the previously assigned trace
       event type identifier shall be returned. If the per-process user
       trace event name limit represented by {TRACE_USER_EVENT_MAX} has been
       reached, the pre-defined POSIX_TRACE_UNNAMED_USEREVENT (Table 2-7,
       Trace Option: User Trace Event) user trace event shall be returned.
       Note:     The above procedure, together with the fact that multiple
                 processes can only be traced into the same trace stream by
                 inheritance, ensure that all the processes that are traced
                 into a trace stream have the same mapping of trace event
                 names to trace event type identifiers.
       If there is no trace stream created, the posix_trace_eventid_open()
       function shall store this information for future trace streams
       created for this process.
