       pcap_list_datalinks() is used to get a list of the supported link-
       layer header types of the interface associated with the pcap
       descriptor.  pcap_list_datalinks() allocates an array to hold the
       list and sets *dlt_buf to point to that array.
       The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
       pcap_free_datalinks(), which frees the list of link-layer header
       types pointed to by dlt_list.
       It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().
