       This function will export the private key to a PKCS1 structure for
       RSA or RSA-PSS keys, and integer sequence for DSA keys. Other keys
       types will be exported in PKCS8 form.
       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN RSA
       PRIVATE KEY".
       It is recommended to use gnutls_x509_privkey_export_pkcs8() instead
       of this function, when a consistent output format is required.
