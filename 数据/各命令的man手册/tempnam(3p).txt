       The tempnam() function shall generate a pathname that may be used for
       a temporary file.
       The tempnam() function allows the user to control the choice of a
       directory. The dir argument points to the name of the directory in
       which the file is to be created. If dir is a null pointer or points
       to a string which is not a name for an appropriate directory, the
       path prefix defined as P_tmpdir in the <stdio.h> header shall be
       used. If that directory is not accessible, an implementation-defined
       directory may be used.
       Many applications prefer their temporary files to have certain
       initial letter sequences in their names. The pfx argument should be
       used for this. This argument may be a null pointer or point to a
       string of up to five bytes to be used as the beginning of the
       filename.
       Some implementations of tempnam() may use tmpnam() internally. On
       such implementations, if called more than {TMP_MAX} times in a single
       process, the behavior is implementation-defined.
