       The pthread_setschedparam() function sets the scheduling policy and
       parameters of the thread thread.
       policy specifies the new scheduling policy for thread.  The supported
       values for policy, and their semantics, are described in sched(7).
       The structure pointed to by param specifies the new scheduling
       parameters for thread.  Scheduling parameters are maintained in the
       following structure:
           struct sched_param {
               int sched_priority;     /* Scheduling priority */
           };
       As can be seen, only one scheduling parameter is supported.  For
       details of the permitted ranges for scheduling priorities in each
       scheduling policy, see sched(7).
       The pthread_getschedparam() function returns the scheduling policy
       and parameters of the thread thread, in the buffers pointed to by
       policy and param, respectively.  The returned priority value is that
       set by the most recent pthread_setschedparam(),
       pthread_setschedprio(3), or pthread_create(3) call that affected
       thread.  The returned priority does not reflect any temporary prior‚Äê
       ity adjustments as a result of calls to any priority inheritance or
       priority ceiling functions (see, for example,
       pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling(3) and
       pthread_mutexattr_setprotocol(3)).
