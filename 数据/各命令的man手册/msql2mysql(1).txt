       Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to that
       for the mSQL database system. Because of this, mSQL programs often
       can be converted relatively easily for use with MySQL by changing the
       names of the C API functions.
       The msql2mysql utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API function
       calls to their MySQL equivalents.  msql2mysql converts the input file
       in place, so make a copy of the original before converting it. For
       example, use msql2mysql like this:
           shell> cp client-prog.c client-prog.c.orig
           shell> msql2mysql client-prog.c
           client-prog.c converted
       Then examine client-prog.c and make any post-conversion revisions
       that may be necessary.
       msql2mysql uses the replace utility to make the function name
       substitutions. See replace(1).
