       Shrink or extend the size of each FILE to the specified size
       A FILE argument that does not exist is created.
       If a FILE is larger than the specified size, the extra data is lost.
       If a FILE is shorter, it is extended and the extended part (hole)
       reads as zero bytes.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.
       -c, --no-create
              do not create any files
       -o, --io-blocks
              treat SIZE as number of IO blocks instead of bytes
       -r, --reference=RFILE
              base size on RFILE
       -s, --size=SIZE
              set or adjust the file size by SIZE bytes
       --help display this help and exit
       --version
              output version information and exit
       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is
       10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,...
       (powers of 1000).
       SIZE may also be prefixed by one of the following modifying
       characters: '+' extend by, '-' reduce by, '<' at most, '>' at least,
       '/' round down to multiple of, '%' round up to multiple of.
