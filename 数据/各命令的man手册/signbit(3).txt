       signbit() is a generic macro which can work on all real floating-
       point types.  It returns a nonzero value if the value of x has its
       sign bit set.
       This is not the same as x < 0.0, because IEEE 754 floating point
       allows zero to be signed.  The comparison -0.0 < 0.0 is false, but
       signbit(-0.0) will return a nonzero value.
       NaNs and infinities have a sign bit.
