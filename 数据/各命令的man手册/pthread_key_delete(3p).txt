       The pthread_key_delete() function shall delete a thread-specific data
       key previously returned by pthread_key_create().  The thread-specific
       data values associated with key need not be NULL at the time
       pthread_key_delete() is called. It is the responsibility of the
       application to free any application storage or perform any cleanup
       actions for data structures related to the deleted key or associated
       thread-specific data in any threads; this cleanup can be done either
       before or after pthread_key_delete() is called. Any attempt to use
       key following the call to pthread_key_delete() results in undefined
       behavior.
       The pthread_key_delete() function shall be callable from within
       destructor functions. No destructor functions shall be invoked by
       pthread_key_delete().  Any destructor function that may have been
       associated with key shall no longer be called upon thread exit.
