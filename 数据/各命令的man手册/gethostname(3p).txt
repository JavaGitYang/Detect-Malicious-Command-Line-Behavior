       The gethostname() function shall return the standard host name for
       the current machine.  The namelen argument shall specify the size of
       the array pointed to by the name argument. The returned name shall be
       null-terminated, except that if namelen is an insufficient length to
       hold the host name, then the returned name shall be truncated and it
       is unspecified whether the returned name is null-terminated.
       Host names are limited to {HOST_NAME_MAX} bytes.
