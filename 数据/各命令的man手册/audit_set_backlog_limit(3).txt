       audit_set_backlog_limit sets the queue length for audit events
       awaiting transfer to the audit daemon. The default value is 64 which
       can potentially be overrun by bursts of activity. When the backlog
       limit is reached, the kernel consults the failure_flag to see what
       action to take.
