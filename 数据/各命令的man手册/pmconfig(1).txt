       pmconfig displays the values for some or all configuration parameters
       of the local Performance Co-Pilot toolkit installation.
       The -L option may be used to change the default reporting mode so
       that the capabilities of the PCP library are reported, rather than
       the PCP environment.
       An output format suitable for sourcing in shell scripts can be
       obtained using the -s option, which ensures configuration information
       is quoted and preceded by an export statement.  When not reporting
       the library capabilities, this mode will produce a statement that
       does not override an existing setting in the environment for PCP
       configuration variables.
       In the default operating mode, pmconfig is often used in conjunction
       with the $PCP_DIR environment variable to setup scripts running under
       the Windows operating system, where the filesystem hierarchy differs
       greatly to the of Linux/UNIX-based operating systems.
