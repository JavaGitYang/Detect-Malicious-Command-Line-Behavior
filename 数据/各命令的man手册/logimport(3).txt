       The Performance Co-Pilot Log Import (LOGIMPORT) API is a library (and
       Perl wrapper) that supports the creation of PCP archives from
       external sources of performance data, either in the form of
       historical logs and spreadsheets or from real-time sources that are
       not integrated as a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) under the
       control of pmcd(1).
       The typical usage for LOGIMPORT would involve:
       ·  An initial call to pmiStart(3).
       ·  Optional calls to pmiSetHostname(3) and/or pmiSetTimezone(3) to
          set the hostname and timezone for the source of the performance
          data.
       ·  One or more calls to pmiAddMetric(3) to define performance
          metrics.
       ·  One or more calls to pmiAddInstance(3) to define instances
          associated with the metrics.
       ·  Optional calls to pmiGetHandle(3) to defined convenience handles
          for metric-instance pairs.
       ·  A main loop in which performance data is injested and for each
          sample time interval, the PCP archive record is constructed by
          calls to pmiPutValue(3) and/or pmiPutValueHandle(3), followed by a
          call to pmiWrite(3) to flush all data and any associated new
          metadata to the PCP archive.  Alternatively, pmiPutResult(3) could
          be used to package and process all the data for one sample time
          interval.
       ·  Once the input source of data has been consumed, calling pmiEnd(3)
          to complete the PCP archive creation and close all open files.
       If new metrics and/or instances are discovered during the data
       injestion, these can be added by subsequent calls to pmiAddMetric(3)
       and/or pmiAddInstance(3), provided all the metrics and instances have
       been defined before a call to pmiGetHandle(3), pmiPutValue(3)or
       pmiPutResult(3) that references those metrics and instances.
