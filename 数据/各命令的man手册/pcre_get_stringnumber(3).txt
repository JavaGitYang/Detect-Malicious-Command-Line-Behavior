       This convenience function finds the number of a named substring
       capturing parenthesis in a compiled pattern. Its arguments are:
         code    Compiled regular expression
         name    Name whose number is required
       The yield of the function is the number of the parenthesis if the
       name is found, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING otherwise. When duplicate
       names are allowed (PCRE_DUPNAMES is set), it is not defined which of
       the numbers is returned by pcre[16|32]_get_stringnumber(). You can
       obtain the complete list by calling
       pcre[16|32]_get_stringtable_entries().
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
