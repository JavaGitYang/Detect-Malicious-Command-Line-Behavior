       ctermid() returns a string which is the pathname for the current
       controlling terminal for this process.  If s is NULL, a static buffer
       is used, otherwise s points to a buffer used to hold the terminal
       pathname.  The symbolic constant L_ctermid is the maximum number of
       characters in the returned pathname.
