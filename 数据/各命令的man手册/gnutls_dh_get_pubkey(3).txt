       This function will return the peer's public key used in the last
       Diffie-Hellman key exchange.  This function should be used for both
       anonymous and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  The output parameters must
       be freed with gnutls_free().
       Note, that public key is exported as non-negative integer and may
       include a leading zero byte.
