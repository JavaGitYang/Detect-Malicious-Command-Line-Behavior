       dpkg-trigger is a tool to explicitly activate triggers and check for
       its support on the running dpkg.
       This can be used by maintainer scripts in complex and conditional
       situations where the file triggers, or the declarative activate
       triggers control file directive, are insufficiently rich. It can also
       be used for testing and by system administrators (but note that the
       triggers won't actually be run by dpkg-trigger).
       Unrecognized trigger name syntaxes are an error for dpkg-trigger.
