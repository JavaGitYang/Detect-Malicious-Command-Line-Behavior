       Sets or queries various Linux privilege settings that are inherited
       across execve(2).
       In comparison to su(1) and runuser(1), setpriv(1) neither uses PAM,
       nor does it prompt for a password.  It is a simple, non-set-user-ID
       wrapper around execve(2), and can be used to drop privileges in the
       same way as setuidgid(8) from daemontools, chpst(8) from runit, or
       similar tools shipped by other service managers.
