       The grantpt() function shall change the mode and ownership of the
       slave pseudo-terminal device associated with its master pseudo-
       terminal counterpart. The fildes argument is a file descriptor that
       refers to a master pseudo-terminal device. The user ID of the slave
       shall be set to the real UID of the calling process and the group ID
       shall be set to an unspecified group ID. The permission mode of the
       slave pseudo-terminal shall be set to readable and writable by the
       owner, and writable by the group.
       The behavior of the grantpt() function is unspecified if the
       application has installed a signal handler to catch SIGCHLD signals.
