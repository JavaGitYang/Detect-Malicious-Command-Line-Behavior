       This function will decode the given encoded data. The decoded data
       will be allocated, and stored into result.  It will decode using the
       base64 algorithm as used in libsrp.
       You should use gnutls_free() to free the returned data.
       Warning!  This base64 encoding is not the "standard" encoding, so do
       not use it for non-SRP purposes.
