       systemd-machine-id-commit.service is an early boot service
       responsible for committing transient /etc/machine-id files to a
       writable disk file system. See machine-id(5) for more information
       about machine IDs.
       This service is started after local-fs.target in case /etc/machine-id
       is a mount point of its own (usually from a memory file system such
       as "tmpfs") and /etc is writable. The service will invoke
       systemd-machine-id-setup --commit, which writes the current transient
       machine ID to disk and unmount the /etc/machine-id file in a
       race-free manner to ensure that file is always valid and accessible
       for other processes. See systemd-machine-id-setup(1) for details.
       The main use case of this service are systems where /etc/machine-id
       is read-only and initially not initialized. In this case, the system
       manager will generate a transient machine ID file on a memory file
       system, and mount it over /etc/machine-id, during the early boot
       phase. This service is then invoked in a later boot phase, as soon as
       /etc has been remounted writable and the ID may thus be committed to
       disk to make it permanent.
