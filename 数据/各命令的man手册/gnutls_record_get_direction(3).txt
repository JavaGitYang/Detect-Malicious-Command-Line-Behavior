       This function provides information about the internals of the record
       protocol and is only useful if a prior gnutls function call, e.g.
       gnutls_handshake(), was interrupted for some reason. That is, if a
       function returned GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN. In such a
       case, you might want to call select() or poll() before restoring the
       interrupted gnutls function.
       This function's output is unreliable if you are using the same
        session in different threads, for sending and receiving.
