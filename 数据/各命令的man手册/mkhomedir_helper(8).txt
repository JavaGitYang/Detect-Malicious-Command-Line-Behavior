       mkhomedir_helper is a helper program for the pam_mkhomedir module
       that creates home directories and populates them with contents of the
       specified skel directory.
       The default value of umask is 0022 and the default value of
       path-to-skel is /etc/skel.
       The helper is separated from the module to not require direct access
       from login SELinux domains to the contents of user home directories.
       The SELinux domain transition happens when the module is executing
       the mkhomedir_helper.
       The helper never touches home directories if they already exist.
