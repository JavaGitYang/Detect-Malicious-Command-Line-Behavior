       This convenience function finds, for a compiled pattern, the first
       and last entries for a given name in the table that translates
       capturing parenthesis names into numbers. When names are required to
       be unique (PCRE_DUPNAMES is not set), it is usually easier to use
       pcre[16|32]_get_stringnumber() instead.
         code    Compiled regular expression
         name    Name whose entries required
         first   Where to return a pointer to the first entry
         last    Where to return a pointer to the last entry
       The yield of the function is the length of each entry, or
       PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if none are found.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API, including the
       format of the table entries, in the pcreapi page, and a description
       of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
