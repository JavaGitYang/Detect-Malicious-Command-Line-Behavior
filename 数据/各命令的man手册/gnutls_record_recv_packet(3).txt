       This is a lower-level function than gnutls_record_recv() and allows
       to directly receive the whole decrypted packet. That avoids a memory
       copy, and is intended to be used by applications seeking high
       performance.
       The received packet is accessed using gnutls_packet_get() and must be
       deinitialized using gnutls_packet_deinit(). The returned packet will
       be NULL if the return value is zero (EOF).
