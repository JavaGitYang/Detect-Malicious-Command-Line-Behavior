       ldapcompare is a shell-accessible interface to the
       ldap_compare_ext(3) library call.
       ldapcompare opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs
       a compare using specified parameters.   The DN should be a
       distinguished name in the directory.  Attr should be a known
       attribute.  If followed by one colon, the assertion value should be
       provided as a string.  If followed by two colons, the base64 encoding
       of the value is provided.  The result code of the compare is provided
       as the exit code and, unless ran with -z, the program prints TRUE,
       FALSE, or UNDEFINED on standard output.
