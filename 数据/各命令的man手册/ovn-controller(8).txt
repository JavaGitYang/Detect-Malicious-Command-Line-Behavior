       ovn-controller is the local controller daemon for OVN, the Open
       Virtual Network. It connects up to the OVN Southbound database (see
       ovn-sb(5)) over the OVSDB protocol, and down to the Open vSwitch
       database (see ovs-vswitchd.conf.db(5)) over the OVSDB protocol and to
       ovs-vswitchd(8) via OpenFlow. Each hypervisor and software gateway in
       an OVN deployment runs its own independent copy of ovn-controller;
       thus, ovn-controllerâ€™s downward connections are machine-local and do
       not run over a physical network.
