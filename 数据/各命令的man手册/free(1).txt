       free displays the total amount of free and used physical and swap
       memory in the system, as well as the buffers and caches used by the
       kernel. The information is gathered by parsing /proc/meminfo. The
       displayed columns are:
       total  Total installed memory (MemTotal and SwapTotal in
              /proc/meminfo)
       used   Used memory (calculated as total - free - buffers - cache)
       free   Unused memory (MemFree and SwapFree in /proc/meminfo)
       shared Memory used (mostly) by tmpfs (Shmem in /proc/meminfo)
       buffers
              Memory used by kernel buffers (Buffers in /proc/meminfo)
       cache  Memory used by the page cache and slabs (Cached and
              SReclaimable in /proc/meminfo)
       buff/cache
              Sum of buffers and cache
       available
              Estimation of how much memory is available for starting new
              applications, without swapping. Unlike the data provided by
              the cache or free fields, this field takes into account page
              cache and also that not all reclaimable memory slabs will be
              reclaimed due to items being in use (MemAvailable in
              /proc/meminfo, available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels
              2.6.27+, otherwise the same as free)
