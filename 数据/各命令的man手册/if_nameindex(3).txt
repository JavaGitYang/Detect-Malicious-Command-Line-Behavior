       The if_nameindex() function returns an array of if_nameindex
       structures, each containing information about one of the network
       interfaces on the local system.  The if_nameindex structure contains
       at least the following entries:
           unsigned int if_index; /* Index of interface (1, 2, ...) */
           char        *if_name;  /* Null-terminated name ("eth0", etc.) */
       The if_index field contains the interface index.  The if_name field
       points to the null-terminated interface name.  The end of the array
       is indicated by entry with if_index set to zero and if_name set to
       NULL.
       The data structure returned by if_nameindex() is dynamically allo‚Äê
       cated and should be freed using if_freenameindex() when no longer
       needed.
