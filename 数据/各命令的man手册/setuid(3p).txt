       If the process has appropriate privileges, setuid() shall set the
       real user ID, effective user ID, and the saved set-user-ID of the
       calling process to uid.
       If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but uid is equal
       to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID, setuid() shall set the
       effective user ID to uid; the real user ID and saved set-user-ID
       shall remain unchanged.
       The setuid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list
       in any way.
