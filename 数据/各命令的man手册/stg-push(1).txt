       Push one or more patches (defaulting to the first unapplied one) onto
       the stack. The push operation allows patch reordering by commuting
       them with the three-way merge algorithm. If there are conflicts while
       pushing a patch, those conflicts are written to the work tree, and
       the command halts. Conflicts raised during the push operation have to
       be fixed and the git add --update command run (alternatively, you may
       undo the conflicting push with stg undo).
       The command also notifies when the patch becomes empty (fully merged
       upstream) or is modified (three-way merged) by the push operation.
