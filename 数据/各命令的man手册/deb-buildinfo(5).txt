       Each Debian source package build can record the build information in
       a .buildinfo control file, which contains a number of fields.  Each
       field begins with a tag, such as Source or Binary (case insensitive),
       followed by a colon, and the body of the field.  Fields are delimited
       only by field tags.  In other words, field text may be multiple lines
       in length, but the installation tools will generally join lines when
       processing the body of the field (except in case of the multiline
       fields Binary-Only-Changes, Installed-Build-Depends, Environment,
       Checksums-Md5, Checksums-Sha1 and Checksums-Sha256, see below).
       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored
       signature, as specified in RFC4880.
       The name of the .buildinfo file will depend on the type of build and
       will be as specific as necessary but not more; for a build that
       includes any the name will be source-name_source-
       version_arch.buildinfo, or otherwise for a build that includes all
       the name will be source-name_source-version_all.buildinfo, or
       otherwise for a build that includes source the name will be source-
       name_source-version_source.buildinfo.
