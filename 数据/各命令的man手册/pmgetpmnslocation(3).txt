       If an application needs to know where the Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS) is coming from then pmGetPMNSLocation will return
       whether it is from an archive, PMNS_ARCHIVE, or from a local PMNS
       file, PMNS_LOCAL, or from a remote pmcd, PMNS_REMOTE.
       This information may be useful in determining an appropriate error
       message depending on the PMNS' location.
