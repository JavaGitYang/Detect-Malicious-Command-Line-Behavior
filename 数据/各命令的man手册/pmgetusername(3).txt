       Within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) some applications use a special
       (non-root) username to allow access, e.g. to write log files into
       protected directories.
       pmGetUsername returns the name via username.
       The variable name PCP_USER is fetched using pmGetOptionalConfig(3).
       If this succeeds, pmGetUsername returns 1.  Otherwise.  username is
       set to the default value of pcp and pmGetUsername returns 0.
       pmGetUsername is most often used in conjunction with
       pmSetProcessIdentity(3) at process start up.
