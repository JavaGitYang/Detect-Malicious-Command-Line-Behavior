       Don't use these functions under Linux.  Due to a historical mistake,
       under Linux these functions are aliases for raise(3) and signal(2),
       respectively.
       Elsewhere, on System V-like systems, these functions implement
       software signaling, entirely independent of the classical signal(2)
       and kill(2) functions.  The function ssignal() defines the action to
       take when the software signal with number signum is raised using the
       function gsignal(), and returns the previous such action or SIG_DFL.
       The function gsignal() does the following: if no action (or the
       action SIG_DFL) was specified for signum, then it does nothing and
       returns 0.  If the action SIG_IGN was specified for signum, then it
       does nothing and returns 1.  Otherwise, it resets the action to
       SIG_DFL and calls the action function with argument signum, and
       returns the value returned by that function.  The range of possible
       values signum varies (often 1–15 or 1–17).
