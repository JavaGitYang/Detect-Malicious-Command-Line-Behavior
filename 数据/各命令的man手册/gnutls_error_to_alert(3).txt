       Get an alert depending on the error code returned by a gnutls
       function.  All alerts sent by this function should be considered
       fatal.  The only exception is when  err is GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE,
       where a warning alert should be sent to the peer indicating that no
       renegotiation will be performed.
       If there is no mapping to a valid alert the alert to indicate
       internal error is returned.
