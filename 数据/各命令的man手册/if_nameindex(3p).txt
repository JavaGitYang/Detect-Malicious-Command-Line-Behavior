       The if_nameindex() function shall return an array of if_nameindex
       structures, one structure per interface. The end of the array is
       indicated by a structure with an if_index field of zero and an
       if_name field of NULL.
       Applications should call if_freenameindex() to release the memory
       that may be dynamically allocated by this function, after they have
       finished using it.
