       The PASSWD backend to slapd(8) serves up the user account information
       listed in the system passwd(5) file.  This backend is provided for
       demonstration purposes only.  The DN of each entry is
       "uid=<username>,<suffix>".  Note that non-base searches scan the
       entire passwd file, and are best suited for hosts with small passwd
       files.
