       lkbib searches bibliographic databases for references that contain
       the keys key... and prints any references found on the standard
       output.  lkbib will search any databases given by -p options, and
       then a default database.  The default database is taken from the
       REFER environment variable if it is set, otherwise it is
       /usr/dict/papers/Ind.  For each database filename to be searched, if
       an index filename.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be
       searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.
