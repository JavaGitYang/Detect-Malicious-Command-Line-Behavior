       Returns the signature algorithm specified by index that was requested
       by the peer. If the specified index has no data available this
       function returns GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.  If the
       negotiated TLS version does not support signature algorithms then
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned even for the
       first index.  The first index is 0.
       This function is useful in the certificate callback functions to
       assist in selecting the correct certificate.
