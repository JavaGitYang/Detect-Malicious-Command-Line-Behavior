       mke2fs.conf is the configuration file for mke2fs(8).  It controls the
       default parameters used by mke2fs(8) when it is creating ext2, ext3,
       or ext4 filesystems.
       The mke2fs.conf file uses an INI-style format.  Stanzas, or top-level
       sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].  Within each section,
       each line defines a relation, which assigns tags to values, or to a
       subsection, which contains further relations or subsections.  An
       example of the INI-style format used by this configuration file
       follows below:
            [section1]
                 tag1 = value_a
                 tag1 = value_b
                 tag2 = value_c
            [section 2]
                 tag3 = {
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                      subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                 }
                 tag1 = value_d
                 tag2 = value_e
            }
       Comments are delimited by a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character
       at the beginning of the comment, and are terminated by the end of
       line character.
       Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if they contain
       spaces.  Within a quoted string, the standard backslash
       interpretations apply: "\n" (for the newline character), "\t" (for
       the tab character), "\b" (for the backspace character), and "\\" (for
       the backslash character).
       Some relations expect a boolean value.  The parser is quite liberal
       on recognizing ``yes'', '`y'', ``true'', ``t'', ``1'', ``on'', etc.
       as a boolean true value, and ``no'', ``n'', ``false'', ``nil'',
       ``0'', ``off'' as a boolean false value.
       The following stanzas are used in the mke2fs.conf file.  They will be
       described in more detail in future sections of this document.
       [options]
              Contains relations which influence how mke2fs behaves.
       [defaults]
              Contains relations which define the default parameters used by
              mke2fs(8).  In general, these defaults may be overridden by a
              definition in the fs_types stanza, or by a command-line option
              provided by the user.
       [fs_types]
              Contains relations which define defaults that should be used
              for specific file system and usage types.  The file system
              type and usage type can be specified explicitly using the
              -tand-T options to mke2fs(8), respectively.
       [devices]
              Contains relations which define defaults for specific devices.
