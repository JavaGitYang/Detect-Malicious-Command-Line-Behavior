       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiUseContext may be used by applications wishing to
       generate more than one PCP archive concurrently.
       The context argument is a value returned from a previous call to
       pmStart(3) and on successful return from pmiUseContext, the current
       context will have been changed to the one identified by context.
