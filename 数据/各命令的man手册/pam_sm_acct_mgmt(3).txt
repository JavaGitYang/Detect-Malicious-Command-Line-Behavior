       The pam_sm_acct_mgmt function is the service module's implementation
       of the pam_acct_mgmt(3) interface.
       This function performs the task of establishing whether the user is
       permitted to gain access at this time. It should be understood that
       the user has previously been validated by an authentication module.
       This function checks for other things. Such things might be: the time
       of day or the date, the terminal line, remote hostname, etc. This
       function may also determine things like the expiration on passwords,
       and respond that the user change it before continuing.
       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           Return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the database of authentication tokens for
           this authentication mechanism has a NULL entry for the user.
