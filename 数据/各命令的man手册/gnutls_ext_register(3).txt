       This function will register a new extension type. The extension will
       remain registered until gnutls_global_deinit() is called. If the
       extension type is already registered then GNUTLS_E_ALREADY_REGISTERED
       will be returned.
       Each registered extension can store temporary data into the
       gnutls_session_t structure using gnutls_ext_set_data(), and they can
       be retrieved using gnutls_ext_get_data().
       This function is not thread safe.
