       This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the the
       status in the  status variable as a bitwise OR of
       gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
       trusted. Note that value in  status is set only when the return value
       of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a certificate does
       not imply a negative return value).  The default verification flags
       used by this function can be overridden using
       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags(). See the documentation of
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() for details in the verification
       process.
       The acceptable  data types are GNUTLS_DT_DNS_HOSTNAME,
       GNUTLS_DT_RFC822NAME and GNUTLS_DT_KEY_PURPOSE_OID.  The former two
       accept as data a null-terminated hostname or email address, and the
       latter a null-terminated object identifier (e.g.,
       GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER).
       If a DNS hostname is provided then this function will compare the
       hostname in the certificate against the given. If names do not match
       the GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER status flag will be set.  If a key
       purpose OID is provided and the end-certificate contains the extended
       key usage PKIX extension, it will be required to be have the provided
       key purpose or be marked for any purpose, otherwise verification
       status will have the GNUTLS_CERT_SIGNER_CONSTRAINTS_FAILURE flag set.
