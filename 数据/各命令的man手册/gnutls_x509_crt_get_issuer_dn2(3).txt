       This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of issuer of the
       Certificate.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as
       described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
       encoded, depending on the certificate data.
       This function does not output a fully RFC4514 compliant string, if
       that is required see gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_dn3().
