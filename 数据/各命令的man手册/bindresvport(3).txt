       bindresvport() is used to bind the socket referred to by the file
       descriptor sockfd to a privileged anonymous IP port, that is, a port
       number arbitrarily selected from the range 512 to 1023.
       If the bind(2) performed by bindresvport() is successful, and sin is
       not NULL, then sin->sin_port returns the port number actually
       allocated.
       sin can be NULL, in which case sin->sin_family is implicitly taken to
       be AF_INET.  However, in this case, bindresvport() has no way to
       return the port number actually allocated.  (This information can
       later be obtained using getsockname(2).)
