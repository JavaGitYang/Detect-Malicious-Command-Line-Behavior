       keyctl_session_to_parent() changes the session keyring to which the
       calling process's parent subscribes to be the that of the calling
       process.
       The keyring must have link permission available to the calling
       process, the parent process must have the same UIDs/GIDs as the
       calling process, and the LSM must not reject the replacement.
       Furthermore, this may not be used to affect init or a kernel thread.
       Note that the replacement will not take immediate effect upon the
       parent process, but will rather be deferred to the next time it
       returns to userspace from kernel space.
