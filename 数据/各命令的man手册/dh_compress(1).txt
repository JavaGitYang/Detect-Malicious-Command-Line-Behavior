       dh_compress is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       compressing the files in package build directories, and makes sure
       that any symlinks that pointed to the files before they were
       compressed are updated to point to the new files.
       By default, dh_compress compresses files that Debian policy mandates
       should be compressed, namely all files in usr/share/info,
       usr/share/man, files in usr/share/doc that are larger than 4k in
       size, (except the copyright file, .html and other web files, image
       files, and files that appear to be already compressed based on their
       extensions), and all changelog files. Plus PCF fonts underneath
       usr/share/fonts/X11/
