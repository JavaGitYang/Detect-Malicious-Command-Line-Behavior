       This command manages the build-id cache. It can add, remove, update
       and purge files to/from the cache. In the future it should as well
       set upper limits for the space used by the cache, etc. This also
       scans the target binary for SDT (Statically Defined Tracing) and
       record it along with the buildid-cache, which will be used by
       perf-probe. For more details, see perf-probe(1).
