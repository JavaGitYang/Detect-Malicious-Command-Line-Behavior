       vgcfgrestore restores the metadata of a VG from a text back up file
       produced by vgcfgbackup. This writes VG metadata onto the devices
       specifed in back up file.
       A back up file can be specified with --file.  If no backup file is
       specified, the most recent one is used. Use --list for a list of the
       available back up and archive files of a VG.
       WARNING: When a VG contains thin pools, changes to thin metadata
       cannot be reverted, and data loss may occur if thin metadata has
       changed. The force option is required to restore in this case.
