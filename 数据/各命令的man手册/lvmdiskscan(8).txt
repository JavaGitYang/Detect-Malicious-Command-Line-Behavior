       lvmdiskscan scans all SCSI, (E)IDE disks, multiple devices and a
       bunch of other block devices in the system looking for LVM PVs. The
       size reported is the real device size. Define a filter in lvm.conf(5)
       to restrict the scan to avoid a CD ROM, for example.
       This command is deprecated, use pvs instead.
