       The mkstemp() function generates a unique temporary filename from
       template, creates and opens the file, and returns an open file
       descriptor for the file.
       The last six characters of template must be "XXXXXX" and these are
       replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.  Since it will
       be modified, template must not be a string constant, but should be
       declared as a character array.
       The file is created with permissions 0600, that is, read plus write
       for owner only.  The returned file descriptor provides both read and
       write access to the file.  The file is opened with the open(2) O_EXCL
       flag, guaranteeing that the caller is the process that creates the
       file.
       The mkostemp() function is like mkstemp(), with the difference that
       the following bits—with the same meaning as for open(2)—may be
       specified in flags: O_APPEND, O_CLOEXEC, and O_SYNC.  Note that when
       creating the file, mkostemp() includes the values O_RDWR, O_CREAT,
       and O_EXCL in the flags argument given to open(2); including these
       values in the flags argument given to mkostemp() is unnecessary, and
       produces errors on some systems.
       The mkstemps() function is like mkstemp(), except that the string in
       template contains a suffix of suffixlen characters.  Thus, template
       is of the form prefixXXXXXXsuffix, and the string XXXXXX is modified
       as for mkstemp().
       The mkostemps() function is to mkstemps() as mkostemp() is to
       mkstemp().
