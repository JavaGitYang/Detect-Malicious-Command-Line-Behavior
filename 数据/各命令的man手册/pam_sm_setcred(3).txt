       The pam_sm_setcred function is the service module's implementation of
       the pam_setcred(3) interface.
       This function performs the task of altering the credentials of the
       user with respect to the corresponding authorization scheme.
       Generally, an authentication module may have access to more
       information about a user than their authentication token. This
       function is used to make such information available to the
       application. It should only be called after the user has been
       authenticated but before a session has been established.
       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_ESTABLISH_CRED
           Initialize the credentials for the user.
       PAM_DELETE_CRED
           Delete the credentials associated with the authentication
           service.
       PAM_REINITIALIZE_CRED
           Reinitialize the user credentials.
       PAM_REFRESH_CRED
           Extend the lifetime of the user credentials.
       The way the auth stack is navigated in order to evaluate the
       pam_setcred() function call, independent of the pam_sm_setcred()
       return codes, is exactly the same way that it was navigated when
       evaluating the pam_authenticate() library call. Typically, if a stack
       entry was ignored in evaluating pam_authenticate(), it will be
       ignored when libpam evaluates the pam_setcred() function call.
       Otherwise, the return codes from each module specific
       pam_sm_setcred() call are treated as required.
