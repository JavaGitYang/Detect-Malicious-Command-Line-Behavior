       keyctl_read() reads the payload of a key if the key type supports it.
       The caller must have read permission on a key to be able to read it.
       buffer and buflen specify the buffer into which the payload data will
       be placed.  If the buffer is too small, the full size of the payload
       will be returned and no copy will take place.
       keyctl_read_alloc() is similar to keyctl_read() except that it
       allocates a buffer big enough to hold the payload data and places the
       data in it.  If successful, a pointer to the buffer is placed in
       *_buffer.  The caller must free the buffer.
       keyctl_read_alloc() adds a NUL character after the data it retrieves,
       though this is not counted in the size value it returns.
