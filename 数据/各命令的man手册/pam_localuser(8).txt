       pam_localuser is a PAM module to help implementing site-wide login
       policies, where they typically include a subset of the network's
       users and a few accounts that are local to a particular workstation.
       Using pam_localuser and pam_wheel or pam_listfile is an effective way
       to restrict access to either local users and/or a subset of the
       network's users.
       This could also be implemented using pam_listfile.so and a very short
       awk script invoked by cron, but it's common enough to have been
       separated out.
