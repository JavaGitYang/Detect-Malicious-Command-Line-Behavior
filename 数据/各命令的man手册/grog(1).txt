       grog reads the input (file names or standard input) and guesses which
       of the groff(1) options are needed to perform the input with the
       groff program.  A suitable device is now always written as -Tdevice
       including the groff default as -T ps.
       The corresponding groff command is usually displayed in standard
       output.  With the option --run, the generated line is output into
       standard error and the generated groff command is run on the standard
       output.  groffer(1) relies on a perfectly running groff(1).
