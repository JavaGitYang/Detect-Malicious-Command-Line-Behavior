       These system calls are used to access or to change the hostname of
       the current processor.
       sethostname() sets the hostname to the value given in the character
       array name.  The len argument specifies the number of bytes in name.
       (Thus, name does not require a terminating null byte.)
       gethostname() returns the null-terminated hostname in the character
       array name, which has a length of len bytes.  If the null-terminated
       hostname is too large to fit, then the name is truncated, and no
       error is returned (but see NOTES below).  POSIX.1 says that if such
       truncation occurs, then it is unspecified whether the returned buffer
       includes a terminating null byte.
