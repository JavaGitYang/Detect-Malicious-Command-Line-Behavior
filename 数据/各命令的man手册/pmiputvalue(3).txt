       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiPutValue adds a single value to the current output
       record for a given metric and instance.
       The metric's name should match one defined earlier in a call to
       pmiAddMetric(3).
       For singular metrics (those defined with an instance domain of
       PM_INDOM_NULL), the instance should be NULL or an empty string,
       otherwise instance should match the name of an instance defined
       earlier in a call to pmiAddInstance(3) for the metric's instance
       domain.
       The value should be in a format consistent with the metric's type as
       defined in the call to pmiAddMetric(3).
       No data will be written until pmiWrite(3) is called, so multiple
       calls to pmiPutValue or pmiPutValueHandle(3) are typically used to
       accumulate data values for several metric-instance pairs before
       calling pmiWrite(3).
