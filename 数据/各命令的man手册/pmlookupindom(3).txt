       For the instance domain indom, in the current Performance Metrics
       Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) context, locate the
       instance with the external identification given by name, and return
       the internal instance identifier.
       Only the leading non-space characters of name will be used to
       identify the instance.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       pmLookupInDom will return a positive instance identifier on success.
