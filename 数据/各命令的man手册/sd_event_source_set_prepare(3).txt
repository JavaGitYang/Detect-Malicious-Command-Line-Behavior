       sd_event_source_set_prepare() may be used to set a preparation
       callback for the event source object specified as source. The
       callback function specified as callback will be invoked immediately
       before the event loop goes to sleep to wait for incoming events. It
       is invoked with the user data pointer passed when the event source
       was created. The event source will be disabled if the callback
       function returns a negative error code. The callback function may be
       used to reconfigure the precise events to wait for. If the callback
       parameter is passed as NULL the callback function is reset.
       Event source objects have no preparation callback associated when
       they are first created with calls such as sd_event_add_io(3),
       sd_event_add_time(3). Preparation callback functions are supported
       for all event source types with the exception of those created with
       sd_event_add_exit(3). Preparation callback functions are dispatched
       in the order indicated by the event source's priority field, as set
       with sd_event_source_set_priority(3). Preparation callbacks of
       disabled event sources (see sd_event_source_set_enabled(3)) are not
       invoked.
