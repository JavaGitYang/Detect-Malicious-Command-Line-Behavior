       Slapindex is used to regenerate slapd(8) indices based upon the
       current contents of a database.  It opens the given database
       determined by the database number or suffix and updates the indices
       for all values of all attributes of all entries. If a list of
       specific attributes is provided on the command line, only the indices
       for those attributes will be regenerated.  Databases configured as
       subordinate of this one are also re-indexed, unless -g is specified.
       All files eventually created by slapindex will belong to the identity
       slapindex is run as, so make sure you either run slapindex with the
       same identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in slapd(8)), or
       change file ownership before running slapd(8).
