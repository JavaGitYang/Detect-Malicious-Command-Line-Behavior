       This manual page describes the checkmodule command.
       checkmodule is a program that checks and compiles a SELinux security
       policy module into a binary representation.  It can generate either a
       base policy module (default) or a non-base policy module (-m option);
       typically, you would build a non-base policy module to add to an
       existing module store that already has a base module provided by the
       base policy.  Use semodule_package to combine this module with its
       optional file contexts to create a policy package, and then use
       semodule to install the module package into the module store and load
       the resulting policy.
