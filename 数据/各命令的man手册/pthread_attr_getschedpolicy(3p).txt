       The pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() and pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the schedpolicy attribute
       in the attr argument.
       The supported values of policy shall include SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR,
       and SCHED_OTHER, which are defined in the <sched.h> header. When
       threads executing with the scheduling policy SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or
       SCHED_SPORADIC are waiting on a mutex, they shall acquire the mutex
       in priority order when the mutex is unlocked.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() or pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
