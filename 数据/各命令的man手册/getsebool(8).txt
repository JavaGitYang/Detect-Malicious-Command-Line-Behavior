       getsebool reports where a particular SELinux boolean or all SELinux
       booleans are on or off In certain situations a boolean can be in one
       state with a pending change to the other state.  getsebool will
       report this as a pending change.  The pending value indicates the
       value that will be applied upon the next boolean commit.
       The setting of boolean values occurs in two stages; first the pending
       value is changed, then the booleans are committed, causing their
       active values to become their pending values.  This allows a group of
       booleans to be changed in a single transaction, by setting all of
       their pending values as desired and then committing once.
