       The alias utility shall create or redefine alias definitions or write
       the values of existing alias definitions to standard output. An alias
       definition provides a string value that shall replace a command name
       when it is encountered; see Section 2.3.1, Alias Substitution.
       An alias definition shall affect the current shell execution
       environment and the execution environments of the subshells of the
       current shell. When used as specified by this volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008,
       the alias definition shall not affect the parent process of the
       current shell nor any utility environment invoked by the shell; see
       Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment.
