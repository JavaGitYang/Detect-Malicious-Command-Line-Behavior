       sepolicy transition will show all domains that a give SELinux source
       domain can transition to, including the entrypoint.
       If a target domain is given, sepolicy transition will examine policy
       for all transition paths from the source domain to the target domain,
       and will list the paths.  If a transition is possible, this tool will
       print out all transition paths from the source domain to the target
       domain
