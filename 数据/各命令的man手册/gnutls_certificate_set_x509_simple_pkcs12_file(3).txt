       This function sets a certificate/private key pair and/or a CRL in the
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called
       more than once (in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server).
       PKCS12 files with a MAC, encrypted bags and PKCS 8 private keys are
       supported. However, only password based security, and the same
       password for all operations, are supported.
       PKCS12 file may contain many keys and/or certificates, and this
       function will try to auto-detect based on the key ID the certificate
       and key pair to use. If the PKCS12 file contain the issuer of the
       selected certificate, it will be appended to the certificate to form
       a chain.
       If more than one private keys are stored in the PKCS12 file, then
       only one key will be read (and it is undefined which one).
       It is believed that the limitations of this function is acceptable
       for most usage, and that any more flexibility would introduce
       complexity that would make it harder to use this functionality at
       all.
       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
       negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags()
       it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be
       used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.
