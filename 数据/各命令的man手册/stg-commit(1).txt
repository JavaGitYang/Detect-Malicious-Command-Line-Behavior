       Merge one or more patches into the base of the current stack and
       remove them from the series while advancing the base. This is the
       opposite of stg uncommit. Use this command if you no longer want to
       manage a patch with StGIT.
       By default, the bottommost patch is committed. If patch names are
       given, the stack is rearranged so that those patches are at the
       bottom, and then they are committed.
       The -n/--number option specifies the number of applied patches to
       commit (counting from the bottom of the stack). If -a/--all is given,
       all applied patches are committed.
