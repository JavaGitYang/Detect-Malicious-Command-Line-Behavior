       The ctermid() function shall generate a string that, when used as a
       pathname, refers to the current controlling terminal for the current
       process. If ctermid() returns a pathname, access to the file is not
       guaranteed.
       The ctermid() function need not be thread-safe if called with a NULL
       parameter.
