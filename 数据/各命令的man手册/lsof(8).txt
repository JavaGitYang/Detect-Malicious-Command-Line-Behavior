       Lsof revision 4.91 lists on its standard output file information
       about files opened by processes for the following UNIX dialects:
            Apple Darwin 9 and Mac OS X 10.[567]
            FreeBSD 8.[234], 9.0 and 1[012].0 for AMD64-based systems
            Linux 2.1.72 and above for x86-based systems
            Solaris 9, 10 and 11
       (See the DISTRIBUTION section of this manual page for information on
       how to obtain the latest lsof revision.)
       An open file may be a regular file, a directory, a block special
       file, a character special file, an executing text reference, a
       library, a stream or a network file (Internet socket, NFS file or
       UNIX domain socket.)  A specific file or all the files in a file
       system may be selected by path.
       Instead of a formatted display, lsof will produce output that can be
       parsed by other programs.  See the -F, option description, and the
       OUTPUT FOR OTHER PROGRAMS section for more information.
       In addition to producing a single output list, lsof will run in
       repeat mode.  In repeat mode it will produce output, delay, then
       repeat the output operation until stopped with an interrupt or quit
       signal.  See the +|-r [t[m<fmt>]] option description for more
       information.
