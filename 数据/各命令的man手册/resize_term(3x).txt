       This is an extension to the curses library.  It provides callers with
       a hook into the ncurses data to resize windows, primarily for use by
       programs running in an X Window terminal (e.g., xterm).
   resizeterm
       The function resizeterm resizes the standard and current windows to
       the specified dimensions, and adjusts other bookkeeping data used by
       the ncurses library that record the window dimensions such as the
       LINES and COLS variables.
   resize_term
       Most of the work is done by the inner function resize_term.  The
       outer function resizeterm adds bookkeeping for the SIGWINCH handler.
       When resizing the windows, resize_term blank-fills the areas that are
       extended.  The calling application should fill in these areas with
       appropriate data.  The resize_term function attempts to resize all
       windows.  However, due to the calling convention of pads, it is not
       possible to resize these without additional interaction with the
       application.
   is_term_resized
       A support function is_term_resized is provided so that applications
       can check if the resize_term function would modify the window
       structures.  It returns TRUE if the windows would be modified, and
       FALSE otherwise.
