       Clone a git repository into the local directory <dir> (using
       stg-clone(1)) and initialise the local branch "master".
       This operation is for example suitable to start working using the
       "tracking branch" workflow (see 1[1]). Other means to setup an StGit
       stack are stg-init(1) and the --create and --clone commands of
       stg-branch(1).
       The target directory <dir> will be created by this command, and must
       not already exist.
