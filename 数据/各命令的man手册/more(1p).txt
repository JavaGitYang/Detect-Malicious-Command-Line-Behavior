       The more utility shall read files and either write them to the
       terminal on a page-by-page basis or filter them to standard output.
       If standard output is not a terminal device, all input files shall be
       copied to standard output in their entirety, without modification,
       except as specified for the −s option. If standard output is a
       terminal device, the files shall be written a number of lines (one
       screenful) at a time under the control of user commands. See the
       EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
       Certain block-mode terminals do not have all the capabilities
       necessary to support the complete more definition; they are incapable
       of accepting commands that are not terminated with a <newline>.
       Implementations that support such terminals shall provide an
       operating mode to more in which all commands can be terminated with a
       <newline> on those terminals. This mode:
        *  Shall be documented in the system documentation
        *  Shall, at invocation, inform the user of the terminal deficiency
           that requires the <newline> usage and provide instructions on how
           this warning can be suppressed in future invocations
        *  Shall not be required for implementations supporting only fully
           capable terminals
        *  Shall not affect commands already requiring <newline> characters
        *  Shall not affect users on the capable terminals from using more
           as described in this volume of POSIX.1‐2008
