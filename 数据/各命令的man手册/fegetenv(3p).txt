       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fegetenv() function shall attempt to store the current floating-
       point environment in the object pointed to by envp.
       The fesetenv() function shall attempt to establish the floating-point
       environment represented by the object pointed to by envp.  The
       argument envp shall point to an object set by a call to fegetenv() or
       feholdexcept(), or equal a floating-point environment macro. The
       fesetenv() function does not raise floating-point exceptions, but
       only installs the state of the floating-point status flags
       represented through its argument.
