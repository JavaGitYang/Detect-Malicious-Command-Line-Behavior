       The fgetgrent() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the group information from the file referred to by stream.  The first
       time it is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns
       successive entries.  The file referred to by stream must have the
       same format as /etc/group (see group(5)).
       The group structure is defined in <grp.h> as follows:
           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;         /* NULL-terminated array of pointers
                                          to names of group members */
           };
