       pmhttpNewClient allocates and initializes an opaque HTTP client that
       is ready to make requests from a server.
       The URL request interface pmhttpClientFetch issues an HTTP GET
       request to the server specified in the supplied url.  The body of the
       response is returned in the caller supplied bodybuf buffer, of
       bodylen bytes length.  An optional typebuf buffer, of typelen bytes
       length, can also be supplied and (if non-NULL) will contain the value
       of the content-type header returned from the server.
       The url parameter is an RFC1630 format URL.  This will typically be
       prefixed with "http://", however these interfaces also support Unix
       domain sockets.  Those are instead prefixed by "unix://", followed by
       the full filesystem path to the desired Unix domain socket.
       To free up resources associated with an HTTP client, including
       closing any persistent server connection that has been established
       earlier, is accomplished using the pmhttpFreeClient routine.
