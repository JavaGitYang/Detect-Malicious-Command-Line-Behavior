       xfs_scrub_all attempts to read and check all the metadata on all
       mounted XFS filesystems.  The online scrub is performed via the
       xfs_scrub tool, either by running it directly or by using systemd to
       start it in a restricted fashion.  Mounted filesystems are mapped to
       physical storage devices so that scrub operations can be run in
       parallel so long as no two scrubbers access the same device
       simultaneously.
