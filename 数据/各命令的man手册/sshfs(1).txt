       SSHFS (Secure SHell FileSystem) is a file system for Linux (and other
       operating systems with a FUSE implementation, such as Mac OS X or
       FreeBSD) capable of operating on files on a remote computer using
       just a secure shell login on the remote computer. On the local
       computer where the SSHFS is mounted, the implementation makes use of
       the FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) kernel module. The practical
       effect of this is that the end user can seamlessly interact with
       remote files being securely served over SSH just as if they were
       local files on his/her computer. On the remote computer the SFTP
       subsystem of SSH is used.
       If host is a numeric IPv6 address, it needs to be enclosed in square
       brackets.
