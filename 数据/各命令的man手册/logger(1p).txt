       The logger utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and
       format, containing the string operands provided by the user. The
       messages are expected to be evaluated later by personnel performing
       system administration tasks.
       It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales
       other than the POSIX locale are effective.
