       grodvi is a driver for groff that produces TeX DVI format.  Normally
       it should be run by groff -Tdvi.  This will run troff -Tdvi; it will
       also input the macros in /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac/dvi.tmac.
       The DVI file generated by grodvi can be printed by any correctly-
       written DVI driver.  The troff drawing primitives are implemented
       using the tpic version 2 specials.  If the driver does not support
       these, the \D commands will not produce any output.
       There is an additional drawing command available:
       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the
              current position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the
              current position +(dh,dv).  Afterwards the current position
              will be at the opposite corner.  This produces a rule in the
              DVI file and so can be printed even with a driver that does
              not support the tpic specials unlike the other \D commands.
       The groff command \X'anything' is translated into the same command in
       the DVI file as would be produced by \special{anything} in TeX;
       anything may not contain a newline.
       For inclusion of EPS image files, -Tdvi loads pspic.tmac
       automatically, providing the PSPIC macro.  Please check groff_tmac(5)
       for a detailed description.
       Font files for grodvi can be created from tfm files using
       tfmtodit(1).  The font description file should contain the following
       additional commands:
       internalname name
                     The name of the tfm file (without the .tfm extension)
                     is name.
       checksum n    The checksum in the tfm file is n.
       designsize n  The designsize in the tfm file is n.
       These are automatically generated by tfmtodit.
       The default color for \m and \M is black.  Currently, the drawing
       color for \D commands is always black, and fill color values are
       translated to gray.
       In troff the \N escape sequence can be used to access characters by
       their position in the corresponding tfm file; all characters in the
       tfm file can be accessed this way.
       By design, the DVI format doesn't care about physical dimensions of
       the output medium.  Instead, grodvi emits the equivalent to TeX's
       \special{papersize=width,length} on the first page; dvips (and
       possibly other DVI drivers) then sets the page size accordingly.  If
       either the page width or length is not positive, no papersize special
       is output.
