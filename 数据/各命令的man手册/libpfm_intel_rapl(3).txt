       The library supports the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
       energy consumption counters. This is a socket-level set of counters
       which reports energy consumption in Joules. There are up to 3
       counters each measuring only one event. The following events are
       defined:
       RAPL_ENERGY_CORES
              On all processors, the event reports the number of Joules
              consumed by all cores.
               On all processors,
       RAPL_ENERGYC_PKG
              On all processors, th event reports the number of Joules
              consumed by all the cores and Last Level cache (L3).
       RAPL_ENERGY_DRAM
              On server processors, the event reports the number of Joules
              consumed n by the DRAM controller.
              By construction, the events are socket-level and can only be
              measured in system-wide mode. It is necessary and sufficient
              to measure only one CPU per socket to get meaningful results.
