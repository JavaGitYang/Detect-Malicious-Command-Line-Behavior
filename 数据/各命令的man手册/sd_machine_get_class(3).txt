       sd_machine_get_class() may be used to determine the class of a
       locally running virtual machine or container that is registered with
       systemd-machined.service(8). The string returned is either "vm" or
       "container". The returned string needs to be freed with the libc
       free(3) call after use.
       sd_machine_get_ifindices() may be used to determine the numeric
       indices of the network interfaces on the host that are pointing
       towards the specified locally running virtual machine or container
       that is registered with systemd-machined.service(8). The returned
       array needs to be freed with the libc free(3) call after use.
