       The setsockopt() function shall set the option specified by the
       option_name argument, at the protocol level specified by the level
       argument, to the value pointed to by the option_value argument for
       the socket associated with the file descriptor specified by the
       socket argument.
       The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option
       resides. To set options at the socket level, specify the level
       argument as SOL_SOCKET. To set options at other levels, supply the
       appropriate level identifier for the protocol controlling the option.
       For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by the TCP
       (Transport Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP as defined in
       the <netinet/in.h> header.
       The option_name argument specifies a single option to set. It can be
       one of the socket-level options defined in sys_socket.h(0p) and
       described in Section 2.10.16, Use of Options.  If option_name is
       equal to SO_RCVTIMEO or SO_SNDTIMEO and the implementation supports
       setting the option, it is unspecified whether the struct timeval
       pointed to by option_value is stored as provided by this function or
       is rounded up to align with the resolution of the clock being used.
       If setsockopt() is called with option_name equal to SO_ACCEPTCONN,
       SO_ERROR, or SO_TYPE, the behavior is unspecified.
