       logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate
       large numbers of log files.  It allows automatic rotation,
       compression, removal, and mailing of log files.  Each log file may be
       handled daily, weekly, monthly, or when it grows too large.
       Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.  It will not modify a
       log more than once in one day unless the criterion for that log is
       based on the log's size and logrotate is being run more than once
       each day, or unless the -f or --force option is used.
       Any number of config files may be given on the command line. Later
       config files may override the options given in earlier files, so the
       order in which the logrotate config files are listed is important.
       Normally, a single config file which includes any other config files
       which are needed should be used.  See below for more information on
       how to use the include directive to accomplish this.  If a directory
       is given on the command line, every file in that directory is used as
       a config file.
       If no command line arguments are given, logrotate will print version
       and copyright information, along with a short usage summary.  If any
       errors occur while rotating logs, logrotate will exit with non-zero
       status.
