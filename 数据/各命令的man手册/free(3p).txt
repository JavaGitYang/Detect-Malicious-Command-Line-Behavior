       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The free() function shall cause the space pointed to by ptr to be
       deallocated; that is, made available for further allocation. If ptr
       is a null pointer, no action shall occur. Otherwise, if the argument
       does not match a pointer earlier returned by a function in
       POSIX.1‐2008 that allocates memory as if by malloc(), or if the space
       has been deallocated by a call to free() or realloc(), the behavior
       is undefined.
       Any use of a pointer that refers to freed space results in undefined
       behavior.
