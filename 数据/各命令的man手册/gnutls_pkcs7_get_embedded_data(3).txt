       This function will return the data embedded in the signature of the
       PKCS7 structure. If no data are available then
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE will be returned.
       The returned data must be de-allocated using gnutls_free().
       Note, that this function returns the exact same data that are
       authenticated. If the GNUTLS_PKCS7_EDATA_GET_RAW flag is provided,
       the returned data will be including the wrapping tag/value as they
       are encoded in the structure.
