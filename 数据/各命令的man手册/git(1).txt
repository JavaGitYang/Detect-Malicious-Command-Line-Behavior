       Git is a fast, scalable, distributed revision control system with an
       unusually rich command set that provides both high-level operations
       and full access to internals.
       See gittutorial(7) to get started, then see giteveryday(7) for a
       useful minimum set of commands. The Git Userâ€™s Manual[1] has a more
       in-depth introduction.
       After you mastered the basic concepts, you can come back to this page
       to learn what commands Git offers. You can learn more about
       individual Git commands with "git help command". gitcli(7) manual
       page gives you an overview of the command-line command syntax.
