       The chgpasswd command reads a list of group name and password pairs
       from standard input and uses this information to update a set of
       existing groups. Each line is of the format:
       group_name:password
       By default the supplied password must be in clear-text, and is
       encrypted by chgpasswd.
       The default encryption algorithm can be defined for the system with
       the ENCRYPT_METHOD variable of /etc/login.defs, and can be
       overwritten with the -e, -m, or -c options.
       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
