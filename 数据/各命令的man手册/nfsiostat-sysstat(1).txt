       The nfsiostat-sysstat command displays statistics about read and
       write operations on NFS filesystems.
       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The first report contains statistics for the
       time since system startup (boot). Each subsequent report contains
       statistics collected during the interval since the previous report.
       A report consists of an NFS header row followed by a line of
       statistics for each network filesystem that is mounted.  The count
       parameter can be specified in conjunction with the interval
       parameter. If the count parameter is specified, the value of count
       determines the number of reports generated at interval seconds apart.
       If the interval parameter is specified without the count parameter,
       the nfsiostat-sysstat command generates reports continuously.
