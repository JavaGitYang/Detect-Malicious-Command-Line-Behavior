       fputc() writes the character c, cast to an unsigned char, to stream.
       fputs() writes the string s to stream, without its terminating null
       byte ('\0').
       putc() is equivalent to fputc() except that it may be implemented as
       a macro which evaluates stream more than once.
       putchar(c) is equivalent to putc(c, stdout).
       puts() writes the string s and a trailing newline to stdout.
       Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with each other
       and with calls to other output functions from the stdio library for
       the same output stream.
