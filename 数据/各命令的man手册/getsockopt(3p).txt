       The getsockopt() function manipulates options associated with a
       socket.
       The getsockopt() function shall retrieve the value for the option
       specified by the option_name argument for the socket specified by the
       socket argument. If the size of the option value is greater than
       option_len, the value stored in the object pointed to by the
       option_value argument shall be silently truncated. Otherwise, the
       object pointed to by the option_len argument shall be modified to
       indicate the actual length of the value.
       The level argument specifies the protocol level at which the option
       resides. To retrieve options at the socket level, specify the level
       argument as SOL_SOCKET. To retrieve options at other levels, supply
       the appropriate level identifier for the protocol controlling the
       option.  For example, to indicate that an option is interpreted by
       the TCP (Transmission Control Protocol), set level to IPPROTO_TCP as
       defined in the <netinet/in.h> header.
       The socket in use may require the process to have appropriate
       privileges to use the getsockopt() function.
       The option_name argument specifies a single option to be retrieved.
       It can be one of the socket-level options defined in sys_socket.h(0p)
       and described in Section 2.10.16, Use of Options.
