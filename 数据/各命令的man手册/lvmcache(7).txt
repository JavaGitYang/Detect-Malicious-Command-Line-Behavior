       An lvm(8) cache Logical Volume (LV) uses a small and fast LV to
       improve the performance of a large and slow LV.  It does this by
       storing the frequently used blocks on the faster LV.  LVM refers to
       the small fast LV as a cache pool LV.  The large slow LV is called
       the origin LV.  Due to requirements from dm-cache (the kernel
       driver), LVM further splits the cache pool LV into two devices - the
       cache data LV and cache metadata LV.  The cache data LV is where
       copies of data blocks are kept from the origin LV to increase speed.
       The cache metadata LV holds the accounting information that specifies
       where data blocks are stored (e.g.  on the origin LV or on the cache
       data LV).  Users should be familiar with these LVs if they wish to
       create the best and most robust cached LVs.  All of these associated
       LVs must be in the same Volume Group (VG).
