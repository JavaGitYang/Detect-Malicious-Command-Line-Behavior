       ldappasswd is a tool to set the password of an LDAP user.  ldappasswd
       uses the LDAPv3 Password Modify (RFC 3062) extended operation.
       ldappasswd sets the password of associated with the user [or an
       optionally specified user].  If the new password is not specified on
       the command line and the user doesn't enable prompting, the server
       will be asked to generate a password for the user.
       ldappasswd is neither designed nor intended to be a replacement for
       passwd(1) and should not be installed as such.
