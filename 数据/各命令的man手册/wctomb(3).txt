       If s is not NULL, the wctomb() function converts the wide character
       wc to its multibyte representation and stores it at the beginning of
       the character array pointed to by s.  It updates the shift state,
       which is stored in a static anonymous variable known only to the
       wctomb() function, and returns the length of said multibyte
       representation, that is, the number of bytes written at s.
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least MB_CUR_MAX
       bytes at s.
       If s is NULL, the wctomb() function resets the shift state, known
       only to this function, to the initial state, and returns nonzero if
       the encoding has nontrivial shift state, or zero if the encoding is
       stateless.
