       The blkid program is the command-line interface to working with the
       libblkid(3) library.  It can determine the type of content (e.g.
       filesystem or swap) that a block device holds, and also the
       attributes (tokens, NAME=value pairs) from the content metadata (e.g.
       LABEL or UUID fields).
       It is recommended to use lsblk(8) command to get information about
       block devices, or lsblk --fs to get an overview of filesystems, or
       findmnt(8) to search in already mounted filesystems.
              lsblk(8) provides more information, better control on output
              formatting, easy to use in scripts and it does not require
              root permissions to get actual information.  blkid reads
              information directly from devices and for non-root users it
              returns cached unverified information.  blkid is mostly
              designed for system services and to test libblkid
              functionality.
       When device is specified, tokens from only this device are displayed.
       It is possible to specify multiple device arguments on the command
       line.  If none is given, all devices which appear in /proc/partitions
       are shown, if they are recognized.
       blkid has two main forms of operation: either searching for a device
       with a specific NAME=value pair, or displaying NAME=value pairs for
       one or more specified devices.
       For security reasons blkid silently ignores all devices where the
       probing result is ambivalent (multiple colliding filesystems are
       detected).  The low-level probing mode (-p) provides more information
       and extra return code in this case.  It's recommended to use
       wipefs(8) to get a detailed overview and to erase obsolete stuff
       (magic strings) from the device.
