       sched_rr_get_interval() writes into the timespec structure pointed to
       by tp the round-robin time quantum for the process identified by pid.
       The specified process should be running under the SCHED_RR scheduling
       policy.
       The timespec structure has the following form:
           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;    /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;   /* nanoseconds */
           };
       If pid is zero, the time quantum for the calling process is written
       into *tp.
