       The pthread_attr_setinheritsched() function sets the inherit-
       scheduler attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by
       attr to the value specified in inheritsched.  The inherit-scheduler
       attribute determines whether a thread created using the thread
       attributes object attr will inherit its scheduling attributes from
       the calling thread or whether it will take them from attr.
       The following scheduling attributes are affected by the inherit-
       scheduler attribute: scheduling policy
       (pthread_attr_setschedpolicy(3)), scheduling priority
       (pthread_attr_setschedparam(3)), and contention scope
       (pthread_attr_setscope(3)).
       The following values may be specified in inheritsched:
       PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED
              Threads that are created using attr inherit scheduling
              attributes from the creating thread; the scheduling attributes
              in attr are ignored.
       PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED
              Threads that are created using attr take their scheduling
              attributes from the values specified by the attributes object.
       The default setting of the inherit-scheduler attribute in a newly
       initialized thread attributes object is PTHREAD_INHERIT_SCHED.
       The pthread_attr_getinheritsched() returns the inherit-scheduler
       attribute of the thread attributes object attr in the buffer pointed
       to by inheritsched.
