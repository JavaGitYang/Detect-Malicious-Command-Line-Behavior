       pmParseInterval parses the argument string specifying an interval of
       time and fills in the tv_sec and tv_usec components of the rslt
       structure to represent that interval.
       The input string is most commonly the argument following a -t command
       line option to a PCP application, and the syntax is fully described
       in PCPIntro(1).
