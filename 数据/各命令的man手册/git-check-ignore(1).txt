       For each pathname given via the command-line or from a file via
       --stdin, check whether the file is excluded by .gitignore (or other
       input files to the exclude mechanism) and output the path if it is
       excluded.
       By default, tracked files are not shown at all since they are not
       subject to exclude rules; but see ‘--no-index’.
