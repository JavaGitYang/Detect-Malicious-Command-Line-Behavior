       systemd-volatile-root.service is a service that replaces the root
       directory with a volatile memory file system ("tmpfs"), mounting the
       original (non-volatile) /usr inside it read-only. This way, vendor
       data from /usr is available as usual, but all configuration data in
       /etc, all state data in /var and all other resources stored directly
       under the root directory are reset on boot and lost at shutdown,
       enabling fully stateless systems.
       This service is only enabled if full volatile mode is selected, for
       example by specifying "systemd.volatile=yes" on the kernel command
       line. This service runs only in the initial RAM disk ("initrd"),
       before the system transitions to the host's root directory. Note that
       this service is not used if "systemd.volatile=state" is used, as in
       that mode the root directory is non-volatile.
