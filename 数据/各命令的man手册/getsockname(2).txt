       getsockname() returns the current address to which the socket sockfd
       is bound, in the buffer pointed to by addr.  The addrlen argument
       should be initialized to indicate the amount of space (in bytes)
       pointed to by addr.  On return it contains the actual size of the
       socket address.
       The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too
       small; in this case, addrlen will return a value greater than was
       supplied to the call.
