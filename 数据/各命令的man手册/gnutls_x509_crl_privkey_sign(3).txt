       This function will sign the CRL with the issuer's private key, and
       will copy the issuer's information into the CRL.
       This must be the last step in a certificate CRL since all the
       previously set parameters are now signed.
       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed CRL will
       not be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification), until it
       is exported an re-imported.
       After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  dig may be GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN, and
       in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be
       selected.
