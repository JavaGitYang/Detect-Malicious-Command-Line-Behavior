       systemd-bootchart is a tool, usually run at system startup, that
       collects the CPU load, disk load, memory usage, as well as
       per-process information from a running system. Collected results are
       output as an SVG graph. Normally, systemd-bootchart is invoked by the
       kernel by passing init=/usr/lib/systemd/systemd-bootchart on the
       kernel command line. systemd-bootchart will then fork the real init
       off to resume normal system startup, while monitoring and logging
       startup information in the background.
       After collecting a certain amount of data (usually 15â€“30 seconds,
       default 20 s) the logging stops and a graph is generated from the
       logged information. This graph contains vital clues as to which
       resources are being used, in which order, and where possible problems
       exist in the startup sequence of the system. It is essentially a more
       detailed version of the systemd-analyze plot function.
       Of course, bootchart can also be used at any moment in time to
       collect and graph some data for an amount of time. It is recommended
       to use the --rel switch in this case.
       Bootchart does not require root privileges, and will happily run as a
       normal user.
       Bootchart graphs are by default written time-stamped in /run/log and
       saved to the journal with
       MESSAGE_ID=9f26aa562cf440c2b16c773d0479b518. Journal field BOOTCHART=
       contains the bootchart in SVG format.
