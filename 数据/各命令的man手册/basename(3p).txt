       The basename() function shall take the pathname pointed to by path
       and return a pointer to the final component of the pathname, deleting
       any trailing '/' characters.
       If the string pointed to by path consists entirely of the '/'
       character, basename() shall return a pointer to the string "/".  If
       the string pointed to by path is exactly "//", it is implementation-
       defined whether '/' or "//" is returned.
       If path is a null pointer or points to an empty string, basename()
       shall return a pointer to the string ".".
       The basename() function may modify the string pointed to by path, and
       may return a pointer to internal storage. The returned pointer might
       be invalidated or the storage might be overwritten by a subsequent
       call to basename().
       The basename() function need not be thread-safe.
