       Most of the interaction with PCI devices is already handled by the
       kernel PCI layer, and thus these calls should not normally need to be
       accessed from user space.
       pciconfig_read()
              Reads to buf from device dev at offset off value.
       pciconfig_write()
              Writes from buf to device dev at offset off value.
       pciconfig_iobase()
              You pass it a bus/devfn pair and get a physical address for
              either the memory offset (for things like prep, this is
              0xc0000000), the IO base for PIO cycles, or the ISA holes if
              any.
