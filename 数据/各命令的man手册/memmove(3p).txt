       The memmove() function shall copy n bytes from the object pointed to
       by s2 into the object pointed to by s1.  Copying takes place as if
       the n bytes from the object pointed to by s2 are first copied into a
       temporary array of n bytes that does not overlap the objects pointed
       to by s1 and s2, and then the n bytes from the temporary array are
       copied into the object pointed to by s1.
