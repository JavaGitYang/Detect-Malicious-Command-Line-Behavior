       The patch utility shall read a source (patch) file containing any of
       four forms of difference (diff) listings produced by the diff utility
       (normal, copied context, unified context, or in the style of ed) and
       apply those differences to a file. By default, patch shall read from
       the standard input.
       The patch utility shall attempt to determine the type of the diff
       listing, unless overruled by a −c, −e, −n, or −u option.
       If the patch file contains more than one patch, patch shall attempt
       to apply each of them as if they came from separate patch files. (In
       this case, the application shall ensure that the name of the patch
       file is determinable for each diff listing.)
