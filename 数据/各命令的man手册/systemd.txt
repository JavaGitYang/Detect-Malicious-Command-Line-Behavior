       Unit configuration files for services, sockets, mount points, and
       swap devices share a subset of configuration options which define the
       execution environment of spawned processes.
       This man page lists the configuration options shared by these four
       unit types. See systemd.unit(5) for the common options of all unit
       configuration files, and systemd.service(5), systemd.socket(5),
       systemd.swap(5), and systemd.mount(5) for more information on the
       specific unit configuration files. The execution specific
       configuration options are configured in the [Service], [Socket],
       [Mount], or [Swap] sections, depending on the unit type.
       In addition, options which control resources through Linux Control
       Groups (cgroups) are listed in systemd.resource-control(5). Those
       options complement options listed here.
