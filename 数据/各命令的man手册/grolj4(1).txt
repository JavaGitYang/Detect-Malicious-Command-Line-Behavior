       grolj4 is a driver for groff that produces output in PCL5 format
       suitable for an HP Laserjet 4 printer.
       There is an additional drawing command available:
       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at the
              current position, and the diagonally opposite corner at the
              current position +(dh,dv).  Afterwards the current position
              will be at the opposite corner.  This generates a PCL fill
              rectangle command, and so will work on printers that do not
              support HPGL/2 unlike the other \D commands.
