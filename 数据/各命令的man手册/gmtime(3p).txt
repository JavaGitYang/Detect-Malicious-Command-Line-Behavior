       For gmtime(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The gmtime() function shall convert the time in seconds since the
       Epoch pointed to by timer into a broken-down time, expressed as
       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).
       The relationship between a time in seconds since the Epoch used as an
       argument to gmtime() and the tm structure (defined in the <time.h>
       header) is that the result shall be as specified in the expression
       given in the definition of seconds since the Epoch (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 4.15, Seconds Since the
       Epoch), where the names in the structure and in the expression
       correspond.
       The same relationship shall apply for gmtime_r().
       The gmtime() function need not be thread-safe.
       The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime() functions shall
       return values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time
       structure and an array of type char.  Execution of any of the
       functions may overwrite the information returned in either of these
       objects by any of the other functions.
       The gmtime_r() function shall convert the time in seconds since the
       Epoch pointed to by timer into a broken-down time expressed as
       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).  The broken-down time is stored in
       the structure referred to by result.  The gmtime_r() function shall
       also return the address of the same structure.
