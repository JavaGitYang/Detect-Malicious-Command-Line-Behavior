       Exports a commit from Git to a CVS checkout, making it easier to
       merge patches from a Git repository into a CVS repository.
       Specify the name of a CVS checkout using the -w switch or execute it
       from the root of the CVS working copy. In the latter case GIT_DIR
       must be defined. See examples below.
       It does its best to do the safe thing, it will check that the files
       are unchanged and up to date in the CVS checkout, and it will not
       autocommit by default.
       Supports file additions, removals, and commits that affect binary
       files.
       If the commit is a merge commit, you must tell git cvsexportcommit
       what parent the changeset should be done against.
