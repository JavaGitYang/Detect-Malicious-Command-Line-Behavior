       Cryptsetup-reencrypt can be used to change reencryption parameters
       which otherwise require full on-disk data change (re-encryption).
       You can regenerate volume key (the real key used in on-disk
       encryption unclocked by passphrase), cipher, cipher mode.
       Cryptsetup-reencrypt reencrypts data on LUKS device in-place. During
       reencryption process the LUKS device is marked unavailable.
       WARNING: The cryptsetup-reencrypt program is not resistant to
       hardware or kernel failures during reencryption (you can lose your
       data in this case).
       ALWAYS BE SURE YOU HAVE RELIABLE BACKUP BEFORE USING THIS TOOL.
       The reencryption can be temporarily suspended (by TERM signal or by
       using ctrl+c) but you need to retain temporary files named
       LUKS-<uuid>.[log|org|new].  LUKS device is unavailable until
       reencryption is finished though.
       Current working directory must by writable and temporary files
       created during reencryption must be present.
       For more info about LUKS see cryptsetup(8).
