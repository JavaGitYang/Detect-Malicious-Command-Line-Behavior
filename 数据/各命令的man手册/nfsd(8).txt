       The rpc.nfsd program implements the user level part of the NFS
       service. The main functionality is handled by the nfsd kernel module.
       The user space program merely specifies what sort of sockets the
       kernel service should listen on, what NFS versions it should support,
       and how many kernel threads it should use.
       The rpc.mountd server provides an ancillary service needed to satisfy
       mount requests by NFS clients.
