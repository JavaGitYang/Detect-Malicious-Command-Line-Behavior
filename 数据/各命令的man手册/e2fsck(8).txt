       e2fsck is used to check the ext2/ext3/ext4 family of file systems.
       For ext3 and ext4 filesystems that use a journal, if the system has
       been shut down uncleanly without any errors, normally, after
       replaying the committed transactions  in the journal, the file system
       should be marked as clean.   Hence, for filesystems that use
       journalling, e2fsck will normally replay the journal and exit, unless
       its superblock indicates that further checking is required.
       device is a block device (e.g., /dev/sdc1) or file containing the
       file system.
       Note that in general it is not safe to run e2fsck on mounted
       filesystems.  The only exception is if the -n option is specified,
       and -c, -l, or -L options are not specified.   However, even if it is
       safe to do so, the results printed by e2fsck are not valid if the
       filesystem is mounted.   If e2fsck asks whether or not you should
       check a filesystem which is mounted, the only correct answer is
       ``no''.  Only experts who really know what they are doing should
       consider answering this question in any other way.
       If e2fsck is run in interactive mode (meaning that none of -y, -n, or
       -p are specified), the program will ask the user to fix each problem
       found in the filesystem.  A response of 'y' will fix the error; 'n'
       will leave the error unfixed; and 'a' will fix the problem and all
       subsequent problems; pressing Enter will proceed with the default
       response, which is printed before the question mark.  Pressing
       Control-C terminates e2fsck immediately.
