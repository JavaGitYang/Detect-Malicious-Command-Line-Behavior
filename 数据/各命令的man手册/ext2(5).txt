       The second, third, and fourth extended file systems, or ext2, ext3,
       and ext4 as they are commonly known, are Linux file systems that have
       historically been the default file system for many Linux
       distributions.  They are general purpose file systems that have been
       designed for extensibility and backwards compatibility.  In
       particular, file systems previously intended for use with the ext2
       and ext3 file systems can be mounted using the ext4 file system
       driver, and indeed in many modern Linux distributions, the ext4 file
       system driver has been configured to handle mount requests for ext2
       and ext3 file systems.
