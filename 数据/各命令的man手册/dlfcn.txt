       The <dlfcn.h> header shall define at least the following symbolic
       constants for use in the construction of a dlopen() mode argument:
       RTLD_LAZY     Relocations are performed at an implementation-defined
                     time.
       RTLD_NOW      Relocations are performed when the object is loaded.
       RTLD_GLOBAL   All symbols are available for relocation processing of
                     other modules.
       RTLD_LOCAL    All symbols are not made available for relocation
                     processing by other modules.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int    dlclose(void *);
           char  *dlerror(void);
           void  *dlopen(const char *, int);
           void  *dlsym(void *restrict, const char *restrict);
       The following sections are informative.
