       Each Debian binary package contains the master control file, which
       contains a number of fields.  Each field begins with a tag, such as
       Package or Version (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the
       body of the field.  Fields are delimited only by field tags. In other
       words, field text may be multiple lines in length, but the
       installation tools will generally join lines when processing the body
       of the field (except in the case of the Description field, see
       below).
