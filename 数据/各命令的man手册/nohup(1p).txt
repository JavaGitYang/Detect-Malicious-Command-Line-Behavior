       The nohup utility shall invoke the utility named by the utility
       operand with arguments supplied as the argument operands. At the time
       the named utility is invoked, the SIGHUP signal shall be set to be
       ignored.
       If standard input is associated with a terminal, the nohup utility
       may redirect standard input from an unspecified file.
       If the standard output is a terminal, all output written by the named
       utility to its standard output shall be appended to the end of the
       file nohup.out in the current directory. If nohup.out cannot be
       created or opened for appending, the output shall be appended to the
       end of the file nohup.out in the directory specified by the HOME
       environment variable. If neither file can be created or opened for
       appending, utility shall not be invoked. If a file is created, the
       file's permission bits shall be set to S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.
       If standard error is a terminal and standard output is open but is
       not a terminal, all output written by the named utility to its
       standard error shall be redirected to the same open file description
       as the standard output. If standard error is a terminal and standard
       output either is a terminal or is closed, the same output shall
       instead be appended to the end of the nohup.out file as described
       above.
