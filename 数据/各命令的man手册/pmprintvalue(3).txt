       The value of a single performance metric (as identified by val) is
       printed on the standard I/O stream identified by f.
       The value of the performance metric is interpreted according to the
       format of val as defined by valfmt (from a pmValueSet within a
       pmResult structure; see pmFetch(3)) and the generic description of
       the metrics type passed in via type.
       The value for type is typically extracted from a pmDesc structure,
       following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
       metric.
       The output will be optionally padded to be at least minwidth
       characters wide.
       pmPrintValue is most useful for displaying values of performance
       metrics from pmFetch(3) (which returns a set of valfmt and val pairs
       for each requested metric), based upon the metrics type as returned
       from pmLookupDesc(3).
