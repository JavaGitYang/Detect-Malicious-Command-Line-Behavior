       ipcrm removes System V inter-process communication (IPC) objects and
       associated data structures from the system.  In order to delete such
       objects, you must be superuser, or the creator or owner of the
       object.
       System V IPC objects are of three types: shared memory, message
       queues, and semaphores.  Deletion of a message queue or semaphore
       object is immediate (regardless of whether any process still holds an
       IPC identifier for the object).  A shared memory object is only
       removed after all currently attached processes have detached
       (shmdt(2)) the object from their virtual address space.
       Two syntax styles are supported.  The old Linux historical syntax
       specifies a three-letter keyword indicating which class of object is
       to be deleted, followed by one or more IPC identifiers for objects of
       this type.
       The SUS-compliant syntax allows the specification of zero or more
       objects of all three types in a single command line, with objects
       specified either by key or by identifier (see below).  Both keys and
       identifiers may be specified in decimal, hexadecimal (specified with
       an initial '0x' or '0X'), or octal (specified with an initial '0').
       The details of the removes are described in shmctl(2), msgctl(2), and
       semctl(2).  The identifiers and keys can be found by using ipcs(1).
