       The fgetws() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       fgets(3) function.  It reads a string of at most n-1 wide characters
       into the wide-character array pointed to by ws, and adds a
       terminating null wide character (L'\0').  It stops reading wide
       characters after it has encountered and stored a newline wide
       character.  It also stops when end of stream is reached.
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide
       characters at ws.
       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).
