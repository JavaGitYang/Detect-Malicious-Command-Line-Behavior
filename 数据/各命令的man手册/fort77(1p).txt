       The fort77 utility is the interface to the FORTRAN compilation
       system; it shall accept the full FORTRAN-77 language defined by the
       ANSI X3.9‐1978 standard. The system conceptually consists of a
       compiler and link editor. The files referenced by operands are
       compiled and linked to produce an executable file. It is unspecified
       whether the linking occurs entirely within the operation of fort77;
       some implementations may produce objects that are not fully resolved
       until the file is executed.
       If the −c option is present, for all pathname operands of the form
       file.f, the files:
           $(basename pathname.f).o
       shall be created or overwritten as the result of successful
       compilation. If the −c option is not specified, it is unspecified
       whether such .o files are created or deleted for the file.f operands.
       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as −c) and
       all operands compile and link without error, the resulting executable
       file shall be written into the file named by the −o option (if
       present) or to the file a.out.  The executable file shall be created
       as specified in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008, except
       that the file permissions shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG |
       S_IRWXU
       and that the bits specified by the umask of the process shall be
       cleared.
