       “stat overrides” are a way to tell dpkg(1) to use a different owner
       or mode for a path when a package is installed (this applies to any
       filesystem object that dpkg handles, including directories, devices,
       etc.). This can be used to force programs that are normally setuid to
       be install without a setuid flag, or only executable by a certain
       group.
       dpkg-statoverride is a utility to manage the list of stat overrides.
       It has three basic functions: adding, removing and listing overrides.
