       This function will add the given certificate authorities to the
       trusted list. PKCS 11 URLs are also accepted, instead of files, by
       this function. A PKCS 11 URL implies a trust database (a specially
       marked module in p11-kit); the URL "pkcs11:" implies all trust
       databases in the system. Only a single URL specifying trust databases
       can be set; they cannot be stacked with multiple calls.
