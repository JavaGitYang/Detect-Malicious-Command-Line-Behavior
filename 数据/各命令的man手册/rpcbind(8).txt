     The rpcbind utility is a server that converts RPC program numbers into
     universal addresses.  It must be running on the host to be able to make
     RPC calls on a server on that machine.
     When an RPC service is started, it tells rpcbind the address at which
     it is listening, and the RPC program numbers it is prepared to serve.
     When a client wishes to make an RPC call to a given program number, it
     first contacts rpcbind on the server machine to determine the address
     where RPC requests should be sent.
     The rpcbind utility should be started before any other RPC service.
     Normally, standard RPC servers are started by port monitors, so rpcbind
     must be started before port monitors are invoked.
     When rpcbind is started, it checks that certain name-to-address trans‐
     lation-calls function correctly.  If they fail, the network configura‐
     tion databases may be corrupt.  Since RPC services cannot function cor‐
     rectly in this situation, rpcbind reports the condition and terminates.
     The rpcbind utility can only be started by the super-user.
