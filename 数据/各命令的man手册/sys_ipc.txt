       The <sys/ipc.h> header is used by three mechanisms for XSI
       interprocess communication (IPC): messages, semaphores, and shared
       memory. All use a common structure type, ipc_perm, to pass
       information used in determining permission to perform an IPC
       operation.
       The <sys/ipc.h> header shall define the ipc_perm structure, which
       shall include the following members:
           uid_t    uid    Owner's user ID.
           gid_t    gid    Owner's group ID.
           uid_t    cuid   Creator's user ID.
           gid_t    cgid   Creator's group ID.
           mode_t   mode   Read/write permission.
       The <sys/ipc.h> header shall define the uid_t, gid_t, mode_t, and
       key_t types as described in <sys/types.h>.
       The <sys/ipc.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants.
       Mode bits:
       IPC_CREAT   Create entry if key does not exist.
       IPC_EXCL    Fail if key exists.
       IPC_NOWAIT  Error if request must wait.
       Keys:
       IPC_PRIVATE Private key.
       Control commands:
       IPC_RMID    Remove identifier.
       IPC_SET     Set options.
       IPC_STAT    Get options.
       The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
       as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
           key_t  ftok(const char *, int);
