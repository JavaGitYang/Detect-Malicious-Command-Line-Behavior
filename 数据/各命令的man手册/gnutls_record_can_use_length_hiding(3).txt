       If the session supports length-hiding padding, you can invoke
       gnutls_range_send_message() to send a message whose length is hidden
       in the given range. If the session does not support length hiding
       padding, you can use the standard gnutls_record_send() function, or
       gnutls_range_send_message() making sure that the range is the same as
       the length of the message you are trying to send.
