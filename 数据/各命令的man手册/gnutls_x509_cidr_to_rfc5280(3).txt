       This function will convert text CIDR range with prefix (such as
       '10.0.0.0/8') to RFC5280 (IP address in network byte order followed
       by its network mask).  Works for both IPv4 and IPv6.
       The resulting object is directly usable for IP name constraints
       usage, for example in functions
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_permitted or
       gnutls_x509_name_constraints_add_excluded.
       The data in datum needs to be deallocated using gnutls_free().
