       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       If the end-of-file indicator for the input stream pointed to by
       stream is not set and a next byte is present, the fgetc() function
       shall obtain the next byte as an unsigned char converted to an int,
       from the input stream pointed to by stream, and advance the
       associated file position indicator for the stream (if defined). Since
       fgetc() operates on bytes, reading a character consisting of multiple
       bytes (or ``a multi-byte character'') may require multiple calls to
       fgetc().
       The fgetc() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), fscanf(), getc(), getchar(),
       getdelim(), getline(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that returns
       data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().
