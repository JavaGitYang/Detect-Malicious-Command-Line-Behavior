       error() is a general error-reporting function.  It flushes stdout,
       and then outputs to stderr the program name, a colon and a space, the
       message specified by the printf(3)-style format string format, and,
       if errnum is nonzero, a second colon and a space followed by the
       string given by strerror(errnum).  Any arguments required for format
       should follow format in the argument list.  The output is terminated
       by a newline character.
       The program name printed by error() is the value of the global
       variable program_invocation_name(3).  program_invocation_name
       initially has the same value as main()'s argv[0].  The value of this
       variable can be modified to change the output of error().
       If status has a nonzero value, then error() calls exit(3) to
       terminate the program using the given value as the exit status.
       The error_at_line() function is exactly the same as error(), except
       for the addition of the arguments filename and linenum.  The output
       produced is as for error(), except that after the program name are
       written: a colon, the value of filename, a colon, and the value of
       linenum.  The preprocessor values __LINE__ and __FILE__ may be useful
       when calling error_at_line(), but other values can also be used.  For
       example, these arguments could refer to a location in an input file.
       If the global variable error_one_per_line is set nonzero, a sequence
       of error_at_line() calls with the same value of filename and linenum
       will result in only one message (the first) being output.
       The global variable error_message_count counts the number of messages
       that have been output by error() and error_at_line().
       If the global variable error_print_progname is assigned the address
       of a function (i.e., is not NULL), then that function is called
       instead of prefixing the message with the program name and colon.
       The function should print a suitable string to stderr.
