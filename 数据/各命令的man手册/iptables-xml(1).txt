       iptables-xml is used to convert the output of iptables-save into an
       easily manipulatable XML format to STDOUT.  Use I/O-redirection
       provided by your shell to write to a file.
       -c, --combine
              combine consecutive rules with the same matches but different
              targets. iptables does not currently support more than one
              target per match, so this simulates that by collecting the
              targets from consecutive iptables rules into one action tag,
              but only when the rule matches are identical. Terminating
              actions like RETURN, DROP, ACCEPT and QUEUE are not combined
              with subsequent targets.
       -v, --verbose
              Output xml comments containing the iptables line from which
              the XML is derived
       iptables-xml does a mechanistic conversion to a very expressive xml
       format; the only semantic considerations are for -g and -j targets in
       order to discriminate between <call> <goto> and <nane-of-target> as
       it helps xml processing scripts if they can tell the difference
       between a target like SNAT and another chain.
       Some sample output is:
       <iptables-rules>
         <table name="mangle">
           <chain name="PREROUTING" policy="ACCEPT" packet-count="63436"
       byte-count="7137573">
             <rule>
              <conditions>
               <match>
                 <p>tcp</p>
               </match>
               <tcp>
                 <sport>8443</sport>
               </tcp>
              </conditions>
              <actions>
               <call>
                 <check_ip/>
               </call>
               <ACCEPT/>
              </actions>
             </rule>
           </chain>
         </table> </iptables-rules>
       Conversion from XML to iptables-save format may be done using the
       iptables.xslt script and xsltproc, or a custom program using
       libxsltproc or similar; in this fashion:
       xsltproc iptables.xslt my-iptables.xml | iptables-restore
