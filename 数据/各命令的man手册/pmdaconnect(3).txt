       pmdaConnect initializes an IPC channel between a PMDA(3) and the
       pmcd(1) process on the local host.  The type of the connection is
       dependent on the e_io field of the pmdaExt structure:
       pmdaPipe       Use stdin/stdout to communicate; assumes this is a
                      pipe created by pmcd before the PMDA(3) was launched.
       pmdaInet       Assume pmcd(1) will establish a connection to an IPv4
                      internet domain socket set up by the PMDA(3).  The
                      name or number of the port must be specified in the
                      e_sockname or e_port fields of the pmdaExt structure,
                      respectively.
       pmdaIPv6       Assume pmcd(1) will establish a connection to an IPv6
                      internet domain socket set up by the PMDA(3).  The
                      name or number of the port must be specified in the
                      e_sockname or e_port fields of the pmdaExt structure,
                      respectively.
       pmdaUnix       Assume pmcd(1) will establish a connection to a unix
                      domain socket set up by the PMDA(3).  The port number
                      must be specified in the e_port field of the pmdaExt
                      structure.
       pmdaUnknown    The initial value of e_io which defaults to using
                      stdin/stdout.
       The relevant pmdaExt fields are initialized by pmdaDaemon(3) and set
       by pmdaGetOpt(3) or pmdaGetOptions(3) so most PMDAs should not need
       to access or modify them.
       Traditionally most PMDAs have called pmdaConnect after calls to
       pmdaDaemon(3), pmdaGetOptions(3) (or pmdaGetOpt(3)) and pmdaInit(3).
       If the PMDA requires significant processing at startup to identify
       the available metrics and/or instance domains before pmdaInit(3) can
       be called, then it risks timing out during the handshake protocol
       that starts as soon as pmcd(1) launches the PMDA and does not
       conclude until pmdaConnect is called.  In this case, it is advisable
       to move the pmdaConnect call, so that it comes after the call to
       pmdaGetOptions(3) (or pmdaGetOpt(3)) and before the call to
       pmdaInit(3).
