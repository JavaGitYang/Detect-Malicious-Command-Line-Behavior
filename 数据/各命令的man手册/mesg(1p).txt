       The mesg utility shall control whether other users are allowed to
       send messages via write, talk, or other utilities to a terminal
       device. The terminal device affected shall be determined by searching
       for the first terminal in the sequence of devices associated with
       standard input, standard output, and standard error, respectively.
       With no arguments, mesg shall report the current state without
       changing it. Processes with appropriate privileges may be able to
       send messages to the terminal independent of the current state.
