       The ldap_delete_s() routine is used to perform an LDAP delete
       operation synchronously. It takes dn, the DN of the entry to be
       deleted.  It returns an LDAP error code, indicating the success or
       failure of the operation.
       The ldap_delete() routine is used to perform an LDAP delete operation
       asynchronously. It takes the same parameters as ldap_delete_s(), but
       returns the message id of the request it initiated. The result of the
       delete can be obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).
       The ldap_delete_ext() routine  allows  server  and client controls to
       be specified to extend the delete request. This routine is
       asynchronous like ldap_delete(), but its return value is an LDAP
       error code. It stores the message id of the request in the integer
       pointed to by msgidp.
       The ldap_delete_ext_s() routine is the synchronous version of
       ldap_delete_ext().  It also returns an LDAP error code indicating
       success or failure of the operation.
