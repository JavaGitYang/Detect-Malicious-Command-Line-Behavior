       A character set description (charmap) defines all available
       characters and their encodings in a character set.  localedef(1) can
       use charmaps to create locale variants for different character sets.
   Syntax
       The charmap file starts with a header that may consist of the
       following keywords:
       <code_set_name>
              is followed by the name of the character map.
       <comment_char>
              is followed by a character that will be used as the comment
              character for the rest of the file.  It defaults to the number
              sign (#).
       <escape_char>
              is followed by a character that should be used as the escape
              character for the rest of the file to mark characters that
              should be interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the
              backslash (\).
       <mb_cur_max>
              is followed by the maximum number of bytes for a character.
              The default value is 1.
       <mb_cur_min>
              is followed by the minimum number of bytes for a character.
              This value must be less than or equal than <mb_cur_max>.  If
              not specified, it defaults to <mb_cur_max>.
       The character set definition section starts with the keyword CHARMAP
       in the first column.
       The following lines may have one of the two following forms to define
       the character set:
       <character> byte-sequence comment
              This form defines exactly one character and its byte sequence,
              comment being optional.
       <character>..<character> byte-sequence comment
              This form defines a character range and its byte sequence,
              comment being optional.
       The character set definition section ends with the string END
       CHARMAP.
       The character set definition section may optionally be followed by a
       section to define widths of characters.
       The WIDTH_DEFAULT keyword can be used to define the default width for
       all characters not explicitly listed.  The default character width is
       1.
       The width section for individual characters starts with the keyword
       WIDTH in the first column.
       The following lines may have one of the two following forms to define
       the widths of the characters:
       <character> width
              This form defines the width of exactly one character.
       <character>...<character> width
              This form defines the width for all the characters in the
              range.
       The width definition section ends with the string END WIDTH.
