       This document describes the groff program, the main front-end for the
       groff document formatting system.  The groff program and macro suite
       is the implementation of a roff(7) system within the free software
       collection GNU ⟨http://www.gnu.org⟩.  The groff system has all fea‐
       tures of the classical roff, but adds many extensions.
       The groff program allows control of the whole groff system by com‐
       mand-line options.  This is a great simplification in comparison to
       the classical case (which uses pipes only).
