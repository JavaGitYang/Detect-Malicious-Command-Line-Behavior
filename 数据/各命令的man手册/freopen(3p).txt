       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The freopen() function shall first attempt to flush the stream
       associated with stream as if by a call to fflush(stream).  Failure to
       flush the stream successfully shall be ignored. If pathname is not a
       null pointer, freopen() shall close any file descriptor associated
       with stream.  Failure to close the file descriptor successfully shall
       be ignored.  The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream
       shall be cleared.
       The freopen() function shall open the file whose pathname is the
       string pointed to by pathname and associate the stream pointed to by
       stream with it. The mode argument shall be used just as in fopen().
       The original stream shall be closed regardless of whether the
       subsequent open succeeds.
       If pathname is a null pointer, the freopen() function shall attempt
       to change the mode of the stream to that specified by mode, as if the
       name of the file currently associated with the stream had been used.
       In this case, the file descriptor associated with the stream need not
       be closed if the call to freopen() succeeds. It is implementation-
       defined which changes of mode are permitted (if any), and under what
       circumstances.
       After a successful call to the freopen() function, the orientation of
       the stream shall be cleared, the encoding rule shall be cleared, and
       the associated mbstate_t object shall be set to describe an initial
       conversion state.
       If pathname is not a null pointer, or if pathname is a null pointer
       and the specified mode change necessitates the file descriptor
       associated with the stream to be closed and reopened, the file
       descriptor associated with the reopened stream shall be allocated and
       opened as if by a call to open() with the following flags:
                  ┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
                  │ freopen() Mode  │       open() Flags        │
                  ├─────────────────┼───────────────────────────┤
