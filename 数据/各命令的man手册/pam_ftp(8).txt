       pam_ftp is a PAM module which provides a pluggable anonymous ftp mode
       of access.
       This module intercepts the user's name and password. If the name is
       ftp or anonymous, the user's password is broken up at the @ delimiter
       into a PAM_RUSER and a PAM_RHOST part; these pam-items being set
       accordingly. The username (PAM_USER) is set to ftp. In this case the
       module succeeds. Alternatively, the module sets the PAM_AUTHTOK item
       with the entered password and fails.
       This module is not safe and easily spoofable.
