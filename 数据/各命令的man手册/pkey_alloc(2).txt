       pkey_alloc() allocates a protection key (pkey) and allows it to be
       passed to pkey_mprotect(2).
       The pkey_alloc() flags is reserved for future use and currently must
       always be specified as 0.
       The pkey_alloc() access_rights  argument may contain zero or more
       disable operations:
       PKEY_DISABLE_ACCESS
              Disable all data access to memory covered by the returned
              protection key.
       PKEY_DISABLE_WRITE
              Disable write access to memory covered by the returned
              protection key.
       pkey_free() frees a protection key and makes it available for later
       allocations.  After a protection key has been freed, it may no longer
       be used in any protection-key-related operations.
       An application should not call pkey_free() on any protection key
       which has been assigned to an address range by pkey_mprotect(2) and
       which is still in use.  The behavior in this case is undefined and
       may result in an error.
