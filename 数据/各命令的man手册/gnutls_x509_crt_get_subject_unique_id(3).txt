       This function will extract the subjectUniqueID value (if present) for
       the given certificate.
       If the user allocated memory buffer is not large enough to hold the
       full subjectUniqueID, then a GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER error will
       be returned, and buf_size will be set to the actual length.
       This function had a bug prior to 3.4.8 that prevented the setting of
       NULL  buf to discover the  buf_size . To use this function safely
       with the older versions the  buf must be a valid buffer that can hold
       at least a single byte if  buf_size is zero.
