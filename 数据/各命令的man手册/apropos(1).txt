       Each manual page has a short description available within it.
       apropos searches the descriptions for instances of keyword.
       keyword is usually a regular expression, as if (-r) was used, or may
       contain wildcards (-w), or match the exact keyword (-e).  Using these
       options, it may be necessary to quote the keyword or escape (\) the
       special characters to stop the shell from interpreting them.
       The standard matching rules allow matches to be made against the page
       name and word boundaries in the description.
       The database searched by apropos is updated by the mandb program.
       Depending on your installation, this may be run by a periodic cron
       job, or may need to be run manually after new manual pages have been
       installed.
