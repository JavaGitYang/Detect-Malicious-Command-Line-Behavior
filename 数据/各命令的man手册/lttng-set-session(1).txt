       The lttng set-session command sets the current tracing session.
       SESSION is the name of an existing tracing session. lttng list
       outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see lttng-list(1)).
       The current tracing session is used by default when a session can be
       specified in other commands. See lttng-create(1) for more information
       about the current tracing session.
