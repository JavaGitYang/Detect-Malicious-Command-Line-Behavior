       Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the new
       tree object is printed to standard output.
       The index must be in a fully merged state.
       Conceptually, git write-tree sync()s the current index contents into
       a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is actually in
       your directory right now, you need to have done a git update-index
       phase before you did the git write-tree.
