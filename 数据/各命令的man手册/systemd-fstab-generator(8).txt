       systemd-fstab-generator is a generator that translates /etc/fstab
       (see fstab(5) for details) into native systemd units early at boot
       and when configuration of the system manager is reloaded. This will
       instantiate mount and swap units as necessary.
       The passno field is treated like a simple boolean, and the ordering
       information is discarded. However, if the root file system is
       checked, it is checked before all the other file systems.
       See systemd.mount(5) and systemd.swap(5) for more information about
       special /etc/fstab mount options this generator understands.
       systemd-fstab-generator implements systemd.generator(7).
