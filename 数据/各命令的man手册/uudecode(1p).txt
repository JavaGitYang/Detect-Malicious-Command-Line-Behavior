       The uudecode utility shall read a file, or standard input if no file
       is specified, that includes data created by the uuencode utility. The
       uudecode utility shall scan the input file, searching for data
       compatible with one of the formats specified in uuencode, and attempt
       to create or overwrite the file described by the data (or overridden
       by the −o option). The pathname shall be contained in the data or
       specified by the −o option. The file access permission bits and
       contents for the file to be produced shall be contained in that data.
       The mode bits of the created file (other than standard output) shall
       be set from the file access permission bits contained in the data;
       that is, other attributes of the mode, including the file mode
       creation mask (see umask), shall not affect the file being produced.
       If either of the op characters '+' and '−' (see chmod) are specified
       in symbolic mode, the initial mode on which those operations are
       based is unspecified.
       If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and the user does
       not have write permission on that file, uudecode shall terminate with
       an error. If the pathname of the file to be produced exists, and the
       user has write permission on that file, the existing file shall be
       overwritten.
       If the input data was produced by uuencode on a system with a
       different number of bits per byte than on the target system, the
       results of uudecode are unspecified.
