       avc_compute_create() is used to compute a SID to use for labeling a
       new object in a particular class based on a SID pair.  This call is
       identical to security_compute_create(), but does not require
       converting from userspace SID's to contexts and back again.
       avc_compute_member() is used to compute a SID to use for labeling a
       polyinstantiated object instance of a particular class based on a SID
       pair.  This call is identical to security_compute_member(), but does
       not require converting from userspace SID's to contexts and back
       again.
       These functions return a SID for the computed context in the memory
       referenced by sid.
