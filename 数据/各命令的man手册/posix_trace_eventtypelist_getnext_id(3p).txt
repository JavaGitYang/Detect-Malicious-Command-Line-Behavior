       The first time posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() is called, the
       function shall return in the variable pointed to by event the first
       trace event type identifier of the list of trace events of the trace
       stream identified by the trid argument. Successive calls to
       posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id() return in the variable pointed
       to by event the next trace event type identifier in that same list.
       Each time a trace event type identifier is successfully written into
       the variable pointed to by the event argument, the variable pointed
       to by the unavailable argument shall be set to zero. When no more
       trace event type identifiers are available, and so none is returned,
       the variable pointed to by the unavailable argument shall be set to a
       value different from zero.
       The posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind() function shall reset the next
       trace event type identifier to be read to the first trace event type
       identifier from the list of trace events used in the trace stream
       identified by trid.
