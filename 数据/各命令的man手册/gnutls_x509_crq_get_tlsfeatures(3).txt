       This function will get the X.509 TLS features extension structure
       from the certificate request.  The returned structure needs to be
       freed using gnutls_x509_tlsfeatures_deinit().
       When the  flags is set to GNUTLS_EXT_FLAG_APPEND, then if the
       features structure is empty this function will behave identically as
       if the flag was not set. Otherwise if there are elements in the
       features structure then they will be merged with.
       Note that  features must be initialized prior to calling this
       function.
