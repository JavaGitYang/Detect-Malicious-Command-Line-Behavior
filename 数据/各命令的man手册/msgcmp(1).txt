       Compare two Uniforum style .po files to check that both contain the
       same set of msgid strings.  The def.po file is an existing PO file
       with the translations.  The ref.pot file is the last created PO file,
       or a PO Template file (generally created by xgettext).  This is
       useful for checking that you have translated each and every message
       in your program.  Where an exact match cannot be found, fuzzy
       matching is used to produce better diagnostics.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.
   Input file location:
       def.po translations
       ref.pot
              references to the sources
       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
              add DIRECTORY to list for input files search
   Operation modifiers:
       -m, --multi-domain
              apply ref.pot to each of the domains in def.po
       -N, --no-fuzzy-matching
              do not use fuzzy matching
       --use-fuzzy
              consider fuzzy entries
       --use-untranslated
              consider untranslated entries
   Input file syntax:
       -P, --properties-input
              input files are in Java .properties syntax
       --stringtable-input
              input files are in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings syntax
   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit
       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
