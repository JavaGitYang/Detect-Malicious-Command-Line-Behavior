       Wait for data to be received from the provided socket ( ptr ) within
       a timeout period in milliseconds, using select() on the provided  ptr
       .
       This function is provided as a helper for constructing custom
       callbacks for gnutls_transport_set_pull_timeout_function(), which can
       be used if you rely on socket file descriptors.
       Returns -1 on error, 0 on timeout, positive value if data are
       available for reading.
