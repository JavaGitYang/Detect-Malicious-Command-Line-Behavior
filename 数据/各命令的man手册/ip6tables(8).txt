       Iptables and ip6tables are used to set up, maintain, and inspect the
       tables of IPv4 and IPv6 packet filter rules in the Linux kernel.
       Several different tables may be defined.  Each table contains a
       number of built-in chains and may also contain user-defined chains.
       Each chain is a list of rules which can match a set of packets.  Each
       rule specifies what to do with a packet that matches.  This is called
       a `target', which may be a jump to a user-defined chain in the same
       table.
