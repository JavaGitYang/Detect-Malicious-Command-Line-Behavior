       The getrpcent(), getrpcbyname(), and getrpcbynumber() functions each
       return a pointer to an object with the following structure containing
       the broken-out fields of an entry in the RPC program number data
       base.
           struct rpcent {
               char  *r_name;     /* name of server for this RPC program */
               char **r_aliases;  /* alias list */
               long   r_number;   /* RPC program number */
           };
       The members of this structure are:
           r_name      The name of the server for this RPC program.
           r_aliases   A NULL-terminated list of alternate names for the RPC
                       program.
           r_number    The RPC program number for this service.
       The getrpcent() function reads the next entry from the database.  A
       connection is opened to the database if necessary.
       The setrpcent() function opens a connection to the database, and sets
       the next entry to the first entry.  If stayopen is nonzero, then the
       connection to the database will not be closed between calls to one of
       the getrpc*() functions.
       The endrpcent() function closes the connection to the database.
       The getrpcbyname() and getrpcbynumber() functions sequentially search
       from the beginning of the file until a matching RPC program name or
       program number is found, or until end-of-file is encountered.
