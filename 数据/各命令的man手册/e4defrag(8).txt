       e4defrag reduces fragmentation of extent based file. The file
       targeted by e4defrag is created on ext4 filesystem made with "-O
       extent" option (see mke2fs(8)).  The targeted file gets more
       contiguous blocks and improves the file access speed.
       target is a regular file, a directory, or a device that is mounted as
       ext4 filesystem.  If target is a directory, e4defrag reduces
       fragmentation of all files in it. If target is a device, e4defrag
       gets the mount point of it and reduces fragmentation of all files in
       this mount point.
