       The pam_get_authtok function returns the cached authentication token,
       or prompts the user if no token is currently cached. It is intended
       for internal use by Linux-PAM and PAM service modules. Upon
       successful return, authtok contains a pointer to the value of the
       authentication token. Note, this is a pointer to the actual data and
       should not be free()'ed or over-written!
       The prompt argument specifies a prompt to use if no token is cached.
       If a NULL pointer is given, pam_get_authtok uses pre-defined prompts.
       The following values are supported for item:
       PAM_AUTHTOK
           Returns the current authentication token. Called from
           pam_sm_chauthtok(3)pam_get_authtok will ask the user to confirm
           the new token by retyping it. If a prompt was specified, "Retype"
           will be used as prefix.
       PAM_OLDAUTHTOK
           Returns the previous authentication token when changing
           authentication tokens.
       The pam_get_authtok_noverify function can only be used for changing
       the password (from pam_sm_chauthtok(3)). It returns the cached
       authentication token, or prompts the user if no token is currently
       cached. The difference to pam_get_authtok is, that this function does
       not ask a second time for the password to verify it. Upon successful
       return, authtok contains a pointer to the value of the authentication
       token. Note, this is a pointer to the actual data and should not be
       free()'ed or over-written!
       The pam_get_authtok_verify function can only be used to verify a
       password for mistypes gotten by pam_get_authtok_noverify(3). This
       function asks a second time for the password and verify it with the
       password provided by authtok argument. In case of an error, the value
       of authtok is undefined. Else this argument will point to the actual
       data and should not be free()'ed or over-written!
