       The wcsncasecmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       strncasecmp(3) function.  It compares the wide-character string
       pointed to by s1 and the wide-character string pointed to by s2, but
       at most n wide characters from each string, ignoring case differences
       (towupper(3), towlower(3)).
