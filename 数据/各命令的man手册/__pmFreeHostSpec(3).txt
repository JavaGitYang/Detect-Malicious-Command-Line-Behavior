       __pmParseHostSpec accepts a string specifying the location of a PCP
       performance metric collector daemon.  The syntax of the various
       formats of this string is described in PCPIntro(1) where several
       examples are also presented.
       The syntax allows the initial pmcd(1) hostname to be optionally
       followed by a list of port numbers, which will be tried in order when
       connecting to pmcd on that host.  The portlist is separated from the
       hostname using a colon, and each port in the list is comma-separated.
       In addition, one or more optional pmproxy(1) hosts can be specified
       (currently, only one proxy host is supported by the PCP protocols).
       These are separated from each other and from the pmcd component using
       the @ character.  These may also be followed by an optional port
       list, using the same comma-separated syntax as before.
       __pmParseHostSpec takes a null-terminated host specification string
       and returns an array of pmHostSpec structures, where the array has
       count entries.
       These pmHostSpec structures that are returned via hostsp represent
       each individual host in the specification string and has the
       following declaration:
           typedef struct {
               char    *name;       /* hostname (always valid) */
               int     *ports;      /* array of host port numbers */
               int     nports;      /* number of ports in host port array */
           } pmHostSpec;
       __pmUnparseHostSpec performs the inverse operation, creating a string
       representation from a number of hosts structures.  Where the count of
       structures indicated by hosts is greater than one, the proxy syntax
       is used to indicate a chain of proxied hosts.  The size of the
       supplied string buffer must be provided by the caller using the size
       parameter.
