       soelim reads files and replaces lines of the form
              .so file
       by the contents of file.  It is useful if files included with .so
       need to be preprocessed.  Normally, soelim should be invoked with the
       -s option of groff.
       To embed ‘\’ in the file name, write ‘\\’ or ‘\e’.  To embed a space,
       write ‘\ ’.  Any other escape sequence in file makes soelim ignore
       the whole line.
       Note that there must be no whitespace between the leading dot and the
       two characters ‘s’ and ‘o’.  Otherwise, only groff interprets the .so
       request (and soelim ignores it).
