       To send a message to a batch job is to request that a server write a
       message string into one or more output files of the batch job. A
       message is sent to a batch job by a request to the batch server that
       manages the batch job. The qmsg utility is a user-accessible batch
       client that requests the sending of messages to one or more batch
       jobs.
       The qmsg utility shall write messages into the files of batch jobs by
       sending a Job Message Request to the batch server that manages the
       batch job. The qmsg utility shall not directly write the message into
       the files of the batch job.
       The qmsg utility shall send a Job Message Request for those batch
       jobs, and only those batch jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is
       presented to the utility.
       The qmsg utility shall send Job Message Requests for batch jobs in
       the order in which their batch job_identifiers are presented to the
       utility.
       If the qmsg utility fails to process any batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qmsg utility shall not exit before a Job Message Request has been
       sent to the server that manages the batch job that corresponds to
       each successfully processed batch job_identifier.
