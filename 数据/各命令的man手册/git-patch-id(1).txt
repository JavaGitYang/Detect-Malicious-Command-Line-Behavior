       Read a patch from the standard input and compute the patch ID for it.
       A "patch ID" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs
       associated with a patch, with whitespace and line numbers ignored. As
       such, itâ€™s "reasonably stable", but at the same time also reasonably
       unique, i.e., two patches that have the same "patch ID" are almost
       guaranteed to be the same thing.
       IOW, you can use this thing to look for likely duplicate commits.
       When dealing with git diff-tree output, it takes advantage of the
       fact that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit,
       and outputs two 40-byte hexadecimal strings. The first string is the
       patch ID, and the second string is the commit ID. This can be used to
       make a mapping from patch ID to commit ID.
