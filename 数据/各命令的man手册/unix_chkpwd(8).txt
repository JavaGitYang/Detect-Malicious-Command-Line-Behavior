       unix_chkpwd is a helper program for the pam_unix module that verifies
       the password of the current user. It also checks password and account
       expiration dates in shadow. It is not intended to be run directly
       from the command line and logs a security violation if done so.
       It is typically installed setuid root or setgid shadow.
       The interface of the helper - command line options, and input/output
       data format are internal to the pam_unix module and it should not be
       called directly from applications.
