       This function will store the provided hash commitment to the list of
       stored public keys. The key with the given hash will be considered
       valid until the provided expiration time.
       The  store variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the
       storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file backend will
       be used.
       Note that this function is not thread safe with the default backend.
