       The pthread_mutexattr_destroy() function shall destroy a mutex
       attributes object; the object becomes, in effect, uninitialized. An
       implementation may cause pthread_mutexattr_destroy() to set the
       object referenced by attr to an invalid value.
       A destroyed attr attributes object can be reinitialized using
       pthread_mutexattr_init(); the results of otherwise referencing the
       object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
       The pthread_mutexattr_init() function shall initialize a mutex
       attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.
       Results are undefined if pthread_mutexattr_init() is called
       specifying an already initialized attr attributes object.
       After a mutex attributes object has been used to initialize one or
       more mutexes, any function affecting the attributes object (including
       destruction) shall not affect any previously initialized mutexes.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_mutexattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized mutex
       attributes object.
