       msync() flushes changes made to the in-core copy of a file that was
       mapped into memory using mmap(2) back to the filesystem.  Without use
       of this call, there is no guarantee that changes are written back
       before munmap(2) is called.  To be more precise, the part of the file
       that corresponds to the memory area starting at addr and having
       length length is updated.
       The flags argument should specify exactly one of MS_ASYNC and
       MS_SYNC, and may additionally include the MS_INVALIDATE bit.  These
       bits have the following meanings:
       MS_ASYNC
              Specifies that an update be scheduled, but the call returns
              immediately.
       MS_SYNC
              Requests an update and waits for it to complete.
       MS_INVALIDATE
              Asks to invalidate other mappings of the same file (so that
              they can be updated with the fresh values just written).
