       pcp-shping samples and reports on the shell-ping service metrics
       exported by the pmdashping(1) agent.
       The default report from pcp-shping shows two columns for each service
       tag, the first showing service status (zero indicating success) and
       the second service response time, for the last pmdashping command
       refresh cycle.
       When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
       -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and several
       other options become indirectly available.
   Options
       The -c/--status switch displays a summary of the current shell-ping
       collector - information about service refresh interval, the current
       command timeout setting, count of refreshes, and the full command
       line associated with each tag.
       The -l/--tags switch displays the valid tags.
