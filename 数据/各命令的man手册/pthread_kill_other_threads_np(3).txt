       pthread_kill_other_threads_np() has an effect only in the
       LinuxThreads threading implementation.  On that implementation,
       calling this function causes the immediate termination of all threads
       in the application, except the calling thread.  The cancellation
       state and cancellation type of the to-be-terminated threads are
       ignored, and the cleanup handlers are not called in those threads.
