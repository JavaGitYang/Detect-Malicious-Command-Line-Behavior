       This function obtains a certificate in the trust list and advances
       the iterator to the next certificate. The certificate returned in
       crt must be deallocated with gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().
       When past the last element is accessed
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned and the iterator is
       reset.
       The iterator is deinitialized and reset to NULL automatically by this
       function after iterating through all elements until
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned. If the iteration
       is aborted early, it must be manually deinitialized using
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_iter_deinit().
