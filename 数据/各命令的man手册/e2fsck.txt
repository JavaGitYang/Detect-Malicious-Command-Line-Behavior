       e2fsck.conf is the configuration file for e2fsck(8).  It controls the
       default behavior of e2fsck(8) while it is checking ext2, ext3, or
       ext4 filesystems.
       The e2fsck.conf file uses an INI-style format.  Stanzas, or top-level
       sections, are delimited by square braces: [ ].  Within each section,
       each line defines a relation, which assigns tags to values, or to a
       subsection, which contains further relations or subsections.  An
       example of the INI-style format used by this configuration file
       follows below:
            [section1]
                 tag1 = value_a
                 tag1 = value_b
                 tag2 = value_c
            [section 2]
                 tag3 = {
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_a
                      subtag1 = subtag_value_b
                      subtag2 = subtag_value_c
                 }
                 tag1 = value_d
                 tag2 = value_e
            }
       Comments are delimited by a semicolon (';') or a hash ('#') character
       at the beginning of the comment, and are terminated by the end of
       line character.
       Tags and values must be quoted using double quotes if they contain
       spaces.  Within a quoted string, the standard backslash
       interpretations apply: "\n" (for the newline character), "\t" (for
       the tab character), "\b" (for the backspace character), and "\\" (for
       the backslash character).
       The following stanzas are used in the e2fsck.conf file.  They will be
       described in more detail in future sections of this document.
       [options]
              This stanza contains general configuration parameters for
              e2fsck's behavior.
       [defaults]
              Contains relations which define the default parameters used by
              e2fsck(8).  In general, these defaults may be overridden by
              command-line options provided by the user.
       [problems]
              This stanza allows the administrator to reconfigure how e2fsck
              handles various filesystem inconsistencies.
       [scratch_files]
              This stanza controls when e2fsck will attempt to use scratch
              files to reduce the need for memory.
