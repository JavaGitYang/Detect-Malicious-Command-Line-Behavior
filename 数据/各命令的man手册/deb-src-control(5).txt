       Each Debian source package contains the master «control» file, which
       contains at least 2 paragraphs, separated by a blank line.  The first
       paragraph lists all information about the source package in general,
       while each following paragraph describes exactly one binary package.
       Each paragraph consists of at least one field. A field starts with a
       fieldname, such as Package or Section (case insensitive), followed by
       a colon, the body of the field and a newline.  Multi-line fields are
       also allowed, but each supplementary line, without a fieldname,
       should start with at least one space. The content of the multi-line
       fields is generally joined to a single line by the tools (except in
       the case of the Description field, see below). To insert empty lines
       into a multi-line field, insert a dot after the space.  Lines
       starting with a ‘#’ are treated as comments.
