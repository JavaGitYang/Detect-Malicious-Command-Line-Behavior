       The posix_fallocate() function shall ensure that any required storage
       for regular file data starting at offset and continuing for len bytes
       is allocated on the file system storage media. If posix_fallocate()
       returns successfully, subsequent writes to the specified file data
       shall not fail due to the lack of free space on the file system
       storage media.
       If the offset+len is beyond the current file size, then
       posix_fallocate() shall adjust the file size to offset+len.
       Otherwise, the file size shall not be changed.
       It is implementation-defined whether a previous posix_fadvise() call
       influences allocation strategy.
       Space allocated via posix_fallocate() shall be freed by a successful
       call to creat() or open() that truncates the size of the file. Space
       allocated via posix_fallocate() may be freed by a successful call to
       ftruncate() that reduces the file size to a size smaller than
       offset+len.
