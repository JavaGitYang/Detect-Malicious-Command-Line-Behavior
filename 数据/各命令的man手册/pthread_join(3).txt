       The pthread_join() function waits for the thread specified by thread
       to terminate.  If that thread has already terminated, then
       pthread_join() returns immediately.  The thread specified by thread
       must be joinable.
       If retval is not NULL, then pthread_join() copies the exit status of
       the target thread (i.e., the value that the target thread supplied to
       pthread_exit(3)) into the location pointed to by retval.  If the
       target thread was canceled, then PTHREAD_CANCELED is placed in the
       location pointed to by retval.
       If multiple threads simultaneously try to join with the same thread,
       the results are undefined.  If the thread calling pthread_join() is
       canceled, then the target thread will remain joinable (i.e., it will
       not be detached).
