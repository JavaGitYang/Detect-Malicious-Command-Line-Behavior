       This function sets the minimum accepted number of bits, for use in an
       SRP key exchange.  If zero, the default 2048 bits will be used.
       In the client side it sets the minimum accepted number of bits.  If a
       server sends a prime with less bits than that
       GNUTLS_E_RECEIVED_ILLEGAL_PARAMETER will be returned by the
       handshake.
       This function has no effect in server side.
