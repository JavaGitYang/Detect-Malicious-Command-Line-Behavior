       The getenv() function searches the environment list to find the
       environment variable name, and returns a pointer to the corresponding
       value string.
       The GNU-specific secure_getenv() function is just like getenv()
       except that it returns NULL in cases where "secure execution" is
       required.  Secure execution is required if one of the following
       conditions was true when the program run by the calling process was
       loaded:
       *  the process's effective user ID did not match its real user ID or
          the process's effective group ID did not match its real group ID
          (typically this is the result of executing a set-user-ID or set-
          group-ID program);
       *  the effective capability bit was set on the executable file; or
       *  the process has a nonempty permitted capability set.
       Secure execution may also be required if triggered by some Linux
       security modules.
       The secure_getenv() function is intended for use in general-purpose
       libraries to avoid vulnerabilities that could occur if set-user-ID or
       set-group-ID programs accidentally trusted the environment.
