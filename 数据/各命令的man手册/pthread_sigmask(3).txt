       The pthread_sigmask() function is just like sigprocmask(2), with the
       difference that its use in multithreaded programs is explicitly
       specified by POSIX.1.  Other differences are noted in this page.
       For a description of the arguments and operation of this function,
       see sigprocmask(2).
