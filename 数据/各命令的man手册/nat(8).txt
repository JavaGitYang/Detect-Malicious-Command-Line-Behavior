       The nat action allows to perform NAT without the overhead of
       conntrack, which is desirable if the number of flows or addresses to
       perform NAT on is large. This action is best used in combination with
       the u32 filter to allow for efficient lookups of a large number of
       stateless NAT rules in constant time.
