       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaProfile is the default callback which handles the
       receipt of a pmProfile from pmcd(1).  A profile describes the
       instances that pmcd requires in the pmResult structure returned by
       the next fetch.  pmdaProfile simply stores the new profile.
