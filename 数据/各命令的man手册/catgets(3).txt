       catgets() reads the message message_number, in set set_number, from
       the message catalog identified by catalog, where catalog is a catalog
       descriptor returned from an earlier call to catopen(3).  The fourth
       argument, message, points to a default message string which will be
       returned by catgets() if the identified message catalog is not
       currently available.  The message-text is contained in an internal
       buffer area and should be copied by the application if it is to be
       saved or modified.  The return string is always terminated with a
       null byte ('\0').
