       sigsuspend() temporarily replaces the signal mask of the calling
       process with the mask given by mask and then suspends the process
       until delivery of a signal whose action is to invoke a signal handler
       or to terminate a process.
       If the signal terminates the process, then sigsuspend() does not
       return.  If the signal is caught, then sigsuspend() returns after the
       signal handler returns, and the signal mask is restored to the state
       before the call to sigsuspend().
       It is not possible to block SIGKILL or SIGSTOP; specifying these
       signals in mask, has no effect on the process's signal mask.
