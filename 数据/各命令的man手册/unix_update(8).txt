       unix_update is a helper program for the pam_unix module that updates
       the password of a given user. It is not intended to be run directly
       from the command line and logs a security violation if done so.
       The purpose of the helper is to enable tighter confinement of login
       and password changing services. The helper is thus called only when
       SELinux is enabled on the system.
       The interface of the helper - command line options, and input/output
       data format are internal to the pam_unix module and it should not be
       called directly from applications.
