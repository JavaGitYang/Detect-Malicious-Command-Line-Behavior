       These routines insert a wchar_t character string (as many characters
       as will fit on the line) before the character under the cursor.  All
       characters to the right of the cursor are shifted right, with the
       possibility of the rightmost characters on the line being lost.  No
       wrapping is performed.  The cursor position does not change (after
       moving to y, x, if specified).  The four routines with n as the last
       argument insert a leading substring of at most n wchar_t characters.
       If n is less than 1, the entire string is inserted.
       If a character in wstr is a tab, newline, carriage return or
       backspace, the cursor is moved appropriately within the window.  A
       newline also does a clrtoeol before moving.  Tabs are considered to
       be at every eighth column.  If a character in wstr is another control
       character, it is drawn in the ^X notation.  Calling win_wch after
       adding a control character (and moving to it, if necessary) does not
       return the control character, but instead returns a character in the
       ^-representation of the control character.
