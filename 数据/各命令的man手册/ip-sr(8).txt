       The ip sr command is used to configure IPv6 Segment Routing (SRv6)
       internal parameters.
       Those parameters include the mapping between an HMAC key ID and its
       associated hashing algorithm and secret, and the IPv6 address to use
       as source for encapsulated packets.
       The ip sr hmac set command prompts for a passphrase that will be used
       as the HMAC secret for the corresponding key ID. A blank passphrase
       removes the mapping.  The currently supported algorithms for ALGO are
       sha1 and sha256.
       If the tunnel source is set to the address :: (which is the default),
       then an address of the egress interface will be selected. As this
       operation may hinder performances, it is recommended to set a non-
       default address.
