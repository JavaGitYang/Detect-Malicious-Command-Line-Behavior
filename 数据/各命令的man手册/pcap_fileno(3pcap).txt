       If p refers to a network device that was opened for a live capture
       using a combination of pcap_create() and pcap_activate(), or using
       pcap_open_live(), pcap_fileno() returns the file descriptor from
       which captured packets are read.
       If p refers to a ``savefile'' that was opened using functions such as
       pcap_open_offline() or pcap_fopen_offline(), a ``dead'' pcap_t opened
       using pcap_open_dead(), or a pcap_t that was created with
       pcap_create() but that has not yet been activated with
       pcap_activate(), it returns -1.
