       The file contexts backend maps from pathname/mode combinations into
       security contexts. It is used to find the appropriate context for
       each file when relabeling a file system. The returned context must be
       freed using freecon(3).
       selabel_lookup(3) describes the function with its return and error
       codes, however the following errno is clarified further for the file
       contexts backend:
              ENOENT No context corresponding to the path and mode was found
                     - This will also be returned when the file contexts
                     series of files have a context of <<none>> against the
                     path (see the FILE FORMAT section).
       The path argument should be set to the full pathname of the file
       whose assigned context is being checked. The mode argument should be
       set to the mode bits of the file, as determined by lstat(2). mode may
       be zero, however full matching may not occur.
       Any messages generated by selabel_lookup(3) are sent to stderr by
       default, although this can be changed by selinux_set_callback(3).
       selabel_lookup_raw(3) behaves identically to selabel_lookup(3) but
       does not perform context translation.
       The FILES section details the configuration files used to determine a
       file context.
