       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaPMID is the generic callback for translating a dynamic
       metric name into a PMID (pmid).
       Because implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
       PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a PMDA
       (most PMDAs do not support dynamic performance metrics), pmdaPMID is
       a skeleton implementation that returns PM_ERR_NAME.
       A PMDA that supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a
       private callback that replaces pmdaPMID (by assignment to
       version.four.pmid of the pmdaInterface structure) and implements the
       translation from a dynamic performance metric name into the
       associated pmid.
