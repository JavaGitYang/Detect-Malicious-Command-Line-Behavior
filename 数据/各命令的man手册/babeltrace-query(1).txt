       The query command queries the object named OBJECT from the component
       class COMPCLS of the type TYPE found in the Babeltrace plugin PLUGIN
       and prints the results.
       See babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace project
       and its core concepts.
       The available values for TYPE are:
       source, src
           Source component class.
       filter, flt
           Filter component class.
       sink
           Sink component class.
       The exact object names and the parameters that a given component
       class expects are described in its documentation. babeltrace-help(1)
       can generally provide this information.
       You can use the --params=PARAMS option to pass parameters to the
       component class’s query function. See Parameters format for the exact
       format of PARAMS.
       The output of the query command looks like YAML, although it is not
       guaranteed that it is YAML-compliant.
       See EXAMPLES for usage examples.
   Parameters format
       The format of the PARAMS option’s argument is a comma-separated list
       of NAME=VALUE assignments:
           NAME=VALUE[,NAME=VALUE]...
       NAME
           Parameter name (C identifier plus the :, ., and - characters).
       VALUE
           One of:
           ·   null, nul, NULL: null value.
           ·   true, TRUE, yes, YES: true boolean value.
           ·   false, FALSE, no, NO: false boolean value.
           ·   Binary (0b prefix), octal (0 prefix), decimal, or hexadecimal
               (0x prefix) signed 64-bit integer.
           ·   Double precision floating point number (scientific notation
               is accepted).
           ·   Unquoted string with no special characters, and not matching
               any of the null and boolean value symbols above.
           ·   Double-quoted string (accepts escape characters).
           You may put whitespaces around the individual = (assignment) and
           , (separator) characters.
       Example:
           babeltrace ... --params='many=null, fresh=yes, condition=false,
                                    squirrel=-782329, observe=3.14,
                                    simple=beef, needs-quotes="some string",
                                    escape.chars-are:allowed="a \" quote"'
           Important
           Like in the example above, make sure to single-quote the whole
           argument when you run this command from a shell.
   Plugin path
       This command loads Babeltrace plugins to perform its operation. The
       search path for Babeltrace plugins is, in this order:
        1. The colon-separated list of directories in the
           BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
        2. The colon-separated list of directories in the --plugin-path
           option.
        3. If the --omit-home-plugin-path option is absent:
           $HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
        4. If the --omit-system-plugin-path option is absent:
           /usr/local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
       You can use the babeltrace-list-plugins(1) command to dynamically
       list the available plugins.
