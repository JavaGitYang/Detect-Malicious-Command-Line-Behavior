       iptraf is an ncurses-based IP LAN monitor that generates various
       network statistics including TCP info, UDP counts, ICMP and OSPF
       information, Ethernet load info, node stats, IP checksum errors, and
       others.
       If the iptraf command is issued without any command-line options, the
       program comes up in interactive mode, with the various facilities
       accessed through the main menu.
