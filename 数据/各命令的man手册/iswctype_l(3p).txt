       For iswctype(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The iswctype() and iswctype_l() functions shall determine whether the
       wide-character code wc has the character class charclass, returning
       true or false. The iswctype() and iswctype_l() functions are defined
       on WEOF and wide-character codes corresponding to the valid character
       encodings in the current locale, or in the locale represented by
       locale, respectively. If the wc argument is not in the domain of the
       function, the result is undefined.  If the value of charclass is
       invalid (that is, not obtained by a call to wctype() or charclass is
       invalidated by a subsequent call to setlocale() that has affected
       category LC_CTYPE) the result is unspecified.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to iswctype_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
