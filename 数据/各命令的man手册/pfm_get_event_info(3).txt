       This function returns in info information about a specific event
       designated by its opaque unique identifier in idx for the operating
       system specified in os.
       The pfm_event_info_t structure is defined as follows:
       typedef struct {
               const char              *name;
               const char              *desc;
               const char              *equiv;
               size_t           size;
               uint64_t                code;
               pfm_pmu_t               pmu;
               pfm_dtype_t             dtype
               int                     idx;
               int                     nattrs;
               struct {
                 unsigned int is_precise:1;
                 unsigned int reserved_bits:31;
               };
       } pfm_event_info_t;
       The fields of this structure are defined as follows:
       name   This is the name of the event. This is a read-only string.
       desc   This is the description of the event. This is a read-only
              string. It may contain multiple sentences.
       equiv  Certain events may be just variations of actual events. They
              may be provided as handy shortcuts to avoid supplying a long
              list of attributes. For those events, this field is not NULL
              and contains the complete equivalent event string.
       code   This is the raw event code. It should not be confused with the
              encoding of the event. This field represents only the event
              selection code, it does not include any unit mask or attribute
              settings.
       pmu    This is the identification of the PMU model this event belongs
              to. It is of type pfm_pmu_t. Using this value and the
              pfm_get_pmu_info function, it is possible to get PMU
              information.
       dtype  This field returns the representation of the event data. By
              default, it is PFM_DATA_UINT64.
              idx This is the event unique opaque identifier. It is
              identical to the idx passed to the call and is provided for
              completeness.
       nattrs This is the number of attributes supported by this event.
              Attributes may be unit masks or modifiers. If the event has
              not attribute, then the value of this field is simply 0.
       size   This field contains the size of the struct passed. This field
              is used to provide for extensibility of the struct without
              compromising backward compatibility.  The value should be set
              to sizeof(pfm_event_info_t). If instead, a value of 0 is
              specified, the library assumes the struct passed is identical
              to the first ABI version which size is PFM_EVENT_INFO_ABI0.
              Thus, if fields were added after the first ABI, they will not
              be set by the library. The library does check that bytes
              beyond what is implemented are zeroes.
       is_precise
              This bitfield indicates whether or not the event support
              precise sampling.  Precise sampling is a hardware mechanism
              that avoids instruction address skid when using interrupt-
              based sampling. When the event has umasks, this field means
              that at least one umask supports precise sampling. On Intel
              X86 processors, this indicates whether the event supports
              Precise Event-Based Sampling (PEBS).
       The pfm_os_t enumeration provides the following choices:
       PFM_OS_NONE
              The returned information pertains only to what the PMU
              hardware exports.  No operating system attributes is taken
              into account.
       PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT
              The returned information includes the actual PMU hardware and
              the additional attributes exported by the perf_events kernel
              interface.  The perf_event attributes pertain only the PMU
              hardware.  In case perf_events is not detected, an error is
              returned.
       PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT_EXT
              The returned information includes all of what is already
              provided by PFM_OS_PERF_EVENT plus all the software attributes
              controlled by perf_events, such as sampling period, precise
              sampling.
