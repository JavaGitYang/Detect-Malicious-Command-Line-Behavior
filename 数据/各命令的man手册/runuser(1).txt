       runuser allows to run commands with a substitute user and group ID.
       If the option -u is not given, it falls back to su-compatible
       semantics and a shell is executed.  The difference between the
       commands runuser and su is that runuser does not ask for a password
       (because it may be executed by the root user only) and it uses a
       different PAM configuration.  The command runuser does not have to be
       installed with set-user-ID permissions.
       If the PAM session is not required then recommended solution is to
       use setpriv(1) command.
       When called without arguments, runuser defaults to running an
       interactive shell as root.
       For backward compatibility, runuser defaults to not change the
       current directory and to only set the environment variables HOME and
       SHELL (plus USER and LOGNAME if the target user is not root).  This
       version of runuser uses PAM for session management.
