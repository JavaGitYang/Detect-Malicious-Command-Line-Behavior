       pdfmom is a wrapper around groff that facilitates the production of
       PDF documents from files formatted with the mom macros.
       pdfmom prints to stdout, so output must be redirected to a
       destination file.  The size of the final PDF can be reduced by piping
       the output through ps2pdf.
       If called with the -Tpdf option (which is the default), pdfmom
       processes files using groff's native PDF driver, gropdf.  If -Tps is
       given, processing is passed over to pdfroff, which uses groff's
       PostScript driver.  In either case, multiple runs of the source file
       are performed in order to satisfy any forward references in the
       document.
       pdfmom accepts all the same options as groff.  If -Tps is given, the
       options associated with pdfroff are accepted as well.  Please note
       that when pdfmom calls pdfroff, the
              -mpdfmark -mom --no-toc
       options are implied and should not be given on the command line.
       Equally, it is not necessary to supply the -mom or -m mom options
       when -Tps is absent.
       PDF integration with the mom macros is discussed in full in the PDF
       manual, Producing PDFs with groff and mom.
