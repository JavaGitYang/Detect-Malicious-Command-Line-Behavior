       The ldap_first_attribute() and ldap_next_attribute() routines are
       used to step through the attributes in an LDAP entry.
       ldap_first_attribute() takes an entry as returned by
       ldap_first_entry(3) or ldap_next_entry(3) and returns a pointer to
       character string containing the first attribute description in the
       entry.  ldap_next_attribute() returns the next attribute description
       in the entry.
       It also returns, in berptr, a pointer to a BerElement it has
       allocated to keep track of its current position.  This pointer should
       be passed to subsequent calls to ldap_next_attribute() and is used to
       effectively step through the entry's attributes.  The caller is
       solely responsible for freeing the BerElement pointed to by berptr
       when it is no longer needed by calling ber_free(3).  When calling
       ber_free(3) in this instance, be sure the second argument is 0.
       The attribute names returned are suitable for inclusion in a call to
       ldap_get_values(3) to retrieve the attribute's values.
