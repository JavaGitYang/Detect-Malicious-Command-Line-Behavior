       Sends an alert to the peer depending on the error code returned by a
       gnutls function. This function will call gnutls_error_to_alert() to
       determine the appropriate alert to send.
       This function may also return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN, or
       GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED.
       If the return value is GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST, then no alert has
       been sent to the peer.
