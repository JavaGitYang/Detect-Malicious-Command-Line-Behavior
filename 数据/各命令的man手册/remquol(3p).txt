       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       The remquo(), remquof(), and remquol() functions shall compute the
       same remainder as the remainder(), remainderf(), and remainderl()
       functions, respectively. In the object pointed to by quo, they store
       a value whose sign is the sign of x/y and whose magnitude is
       congruent modulo 2n to the magnitude of the integral quotient of x/y,
       where n is an implementation-defined integer greater than or equal to
       3. If y is zero, the value stored in the object pointed to by quo is
       unspecified.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
