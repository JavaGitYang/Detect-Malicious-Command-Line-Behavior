       Adds, removes, or reads notes attached to objects, without touching
       the objects themselves.
       By default, notes are saved to and read from refs/notes/commits, but
       this default can be overridden. See the OPTIONS, CONFIGURATION, and
       ENVIRONMENT sections below. If this ref does not exist, it will be
       quietly created when it is first needed to store a note.
       A typical use of notes is to supplement a commit message without
       changing the commit itself. Notes can be shown by git log along with
       the original commit message. To distinguish these notes from the
       message stored in the commit object, the notes are indented like the
       message, after an unindented line saying "Notes (<refname>):" (or
       "Notes:" for refs/notes/commits).
       Notes can also be added to patches prepared with git format-patch by
       using the --notes option. Such notes are added as a patch commentary
       after a three dash separator line.
       To change which notes are shown by git log, see the
       "notes.displayRef" configuration in git-log(1).
       See the "notes.rewrite.<command>" configuration for a way to carry
       notes across commands that rewrite commits.
