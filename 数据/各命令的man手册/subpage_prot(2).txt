       The PowerPC-specific subpage_prot() system call provides the facility
       to control the access permissions on individual 4 kB subpages on
       systems configured with a page size of 64 kB.
       The protection map is applied to the memory pages in the region
       starting at addr and continuing for len bytes.  Both of these
       arguments must be aligned to a 64-kB boundary.
       The protection map is specified in the buffer pointed to by map.  The
       map has 2 bits per 4 kB subpage; thus each 32-bit word specifies the
       protections of 16 4 kB subpages inside a 64 kB page (so, the number
       of 32-bit words pointed to by map should equate to the number of
       64-kB pages specified by len).  Each 2-bit field in the protection
       map is either 0 to allow any access, 1 to prevent writes, or 2 or 3
       to prevent all accesses.
