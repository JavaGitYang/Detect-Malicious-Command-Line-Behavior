       The mq_setattr() function shall set attributes associated with the
       open message queue description referenced by the message queue
       descriptor specified by mqdes.
       The message queue attributes corresponding to the following members
       defined in the mq_attr structure shall be set to the specified values
       upon successful completion of mq_setattr():
       mq_flags    The value of this member is the bitwise-logical OR of
                   zero or more of O_NONBLOCK and any implementation-defined
                   flags.
       The values of the mq_maxmsg, mq_msgsize, and mq_curmsgs members of
       the mq_attr structure shall be ignored by mq_setattr().
       If omqstat is non-NULL, the mq_setattr() function shall store, in the
       location referenced by omqstat, the previous message queue attributes
       and the current queue status.  These values shall be the same as
       would be returned by a call to mq_getattr() at that point.
