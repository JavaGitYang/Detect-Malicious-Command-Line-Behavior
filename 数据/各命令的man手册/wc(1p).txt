       The wc utility shall read one or more input files and, by default,
       write the number of <newline> characters, words, and bytes contained
       in each input file to the standard output.
       The utility also shall write a total count for all named files, if
       more than one input file is specified.
       The wc utility shall consider a word to be a non-zero-length string
       of characters delimited by white space.
