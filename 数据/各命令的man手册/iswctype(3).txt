       If wc is a wide character having the character property designated by
       desc (or in other words: belongs to the character class designated by
       desc), the iswctype() function returns nonzero.  Otherwise, it
       returns zero.  If wc is WEOF, zero is returned.
       desc must be a character property descriptor returned by the
       wctype(3) function.
