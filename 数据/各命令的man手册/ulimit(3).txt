       Warning: this routine is obsolete.  Use getrlimit(2), setrlimit(2),
       and sysconf(3) instead.  For the shell command ulimit(), see bash(1).
       The ulimit() call will get or set some limit for the calling process.
       The cmd argument can have one of the following values.
       UL_GETFSIZE
              Return the limit on the size of a file, in units of 512 bytes.
       UL_SETFSIZE
              Set the limit on the size of a file.
       3      (Not implemented for Linux.)  Return the maximum possible
              address of the data segment.
       4      (Implemented but no symbolic constant provided.)  Return the
              maximum number of files that the calling process can open.
