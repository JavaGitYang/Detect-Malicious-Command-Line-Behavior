       fsfreeze suspends or resumes access to a filesystem.
       fsfreeze halts any new access to the filesystem and creates a stable
       image on disk.  fsfreeze is intended to be used with hardware RAID
       devices that support the creation of snapshots.
       fsfreeze is unnecessary for device-mapper devices.  The device-mapper
       (and LVM) automatically freezes a filesystem on the device when a
       snapshot creation is requested.  For more details see the dmsetup(8)
       man page.
       The mountpoint argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted.  The filesystem must be mounted to be frozen
       (see mount(8)).
       Note that access-time updates are also suspended if the filesystem is
       mounted with the traditional atime behavior (mount option
       strictatime, for more details see mount(8)).
