       Edit the description and author information of the given patch (or
       the current patch if no patch name was given). With --diff, also edit
       the diff.
       The editor is invoked with the following contents:
           From: A U Thor <author@example.com>
           Date: creation date
           Patch description
       If --diff was specified, the diff appears at the bottom, after a
       separator:
           ---
           Diff text
       Command-line options can be used to modify specific information
       without invoking the editor. (With the --edit option, the editor is
       invoked even if such command-line options are given.)
       If the patch diff is edited but does not apply, no changes are made
       to the patch at all. The edited patch is saved to a file which you
       can feed to "stg edit --file", once you have made sure it does apply.
       With --set-tree you set the git tree of the patch to the specified
       TREE-ISH without changing the tree of any other patches. When used on
       the top patch, the index and work tree will be updated to match the
       tree. This low-level option is primarily meant to be used by tools
       built on top of StGit, such as the Emacs mode. See also the
       --set-tree flag of stg push.
