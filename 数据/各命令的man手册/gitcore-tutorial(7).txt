       This tutorial explains how to use the "core" Git commands to set up
       and work with a Git repository.
       If you just need to use Git as a revision control system you may
       prefer to start with "A Tutorial Introduction to Git" (‐
       gittutorial(7)) or the Git User Manual[1].
       However, an understanding of these low-level tools can be helpful if
       you want to understand Git’s internals.
       The core Git is often called "plumbing", with the prettier user
       interfaces on top of it called "porcelain". You may not want to use
       the plumbing directly very often, but it can be good to know what the
       plumbing does when the porcelain isn’t flushing.
       Back when this document was originally written, many porcelain
       commands were shell scripts. For simplicity, it still uses them as
       examples to illustrate how plumbing is fit together to form the
       porcelain commands. The source tree includes some of these scripts in
       contrib/examples/ for reference. Although these are not implemented
       as shell scripts anymore, the description of what the plumbing layer
       commands do is still valid.
           Note
           Deeper technical details are often marked as Notes, which you can
           skip on your first reading.
