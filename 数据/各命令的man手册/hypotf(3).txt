       These functions return sqrt(x*x+y*y).  This is the length of the
       hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle with sides of length x and y,
       or the distance of the point (x,y) from the origin.
       The calculation is performed without undue overflow or underflow
       during the intermediate steps of the calculation.
