       A package can perform several pre-removal actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable prerm file in its control archive
       (i.e. DEBIAN/prerm during package creation).
       The script can be called in the following ways:
       prerm remove
              Before the package is removed.
       old-prerm upgrade new-version
              Before an upgrade.
       new-prerm failed-upgrade old-version new-version
              If the above upgrade fails.
       prerm deconfigure in-favour new-package new-version
           [ removing old-package old-version ]
              Before package is deconfigured while dependency is replaced
              due to conflict.
       prerm remove in-favour new-package new-version
              Before the package is replaced due to conflict.
