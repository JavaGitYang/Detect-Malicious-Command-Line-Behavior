       lpadmin configures printer and class queues provided by CUPS.  It can
       also be used to set the server default printer or class.
       When specified before the -d, -p, or -x options, the -E option forces
       encryption when connecting to the server.
       The first form of the command (-d) sets the default printer or class
       to destination.  Subsequent print jobs submitted via the lp(1) or
       lpr(1) commands will use this destination unless the user specifies
       otherwise with the lpoptions(1) command.
       The second form of the command (-p) configures the named printer or
       class.  The additional options are described below.
       The third form of the command (-x) deletes the printer or class
       destination.  Any jobs that are pending for the destination will be
       removed and any job that is currently printed will be aborted.
