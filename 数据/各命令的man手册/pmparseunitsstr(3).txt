       pmParseUnitsStr is designed to encapsulate the interpretation of a
       units (dimension and scale) specification in command line switches
       for use by the PCP client tools.
       This function expects to be called with the unit/scale specification
       as string.  This specification takes the general form produced by
       pmUnitsStr(3).  Briefly, the format allows /-separated divisor and
       dividend, each listing space-separated dimensions/scales along the
       space, time, and count axes.  There are also a few extra
       possibilities:
       First, multiple equivalent sets of keywords are accepted for the time
       and space dimensions, insensitive to case.  For example,
       "microseconds", "microsecond", "microsec", "us" are considered
       synonymous, as are "kilobytes", "KB", "KiB", "kiloByte", and so on.
       Second, units may be offered in any order, e.g., ms kb count x 10^3
       or count x 10^3 kb ms.  They may not be repeated within the
       denominator or within the numerator.  Each scale/unit keyword may be
       immediately followed by positive or negative exponents, e.g., ^-4.
       Third, numerical scaling factors may be supplied.  These are factored
       together with implicit scale conversions into the final outMult
       result.
       The out and outMult values must both be allocated before calling
       pmParseUnitsStr(3).  If the conversion is successful, pmParseUnitsStr
       returns 0, and fills in out and outMult with the unit/scales defined
       by the input parameter.  If the argument strings could not be parsed,
       it returns a negative status code.
