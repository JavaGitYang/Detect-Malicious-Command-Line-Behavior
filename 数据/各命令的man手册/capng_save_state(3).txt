       capng_save_state is a function that returns a pointer to the internal
       state of the libcap-ng library. It should be considered opaque and
       not for alteration directly. This function should be used when you
       suspect a third party library may use libcap-ng also and want to make
       sure it doesn't alter something important. This function is not
       available in the python bindings.
