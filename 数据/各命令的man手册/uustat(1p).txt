       The uustat utility shall display the status of, or cancel, previously
       specified uucp requests, or provide general status on uucp
       connections to other systems.
       When no options are given, uustat shall write to standard output the
       status of all uucp requests issued by the current user.
       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
       configured to use the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008,
       Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface, but other communications
       means may be used. On systems where there are no available
       communications means (either temporarily or permanently), this
       utility shall write an error message describing the problem and exit
       with a non-zero exit status.
