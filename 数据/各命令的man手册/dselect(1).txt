       dselect is one of the primary user interfaces for managing packages
       on a Debian system. At the dselect main menu, the system
       administrator can:
        - Update the list of available package versions,
        - View the status of installed and available packages,
        - Alter package selections and manage dependencies,
        - Install new packages or upgrade to newer versions.
       dselect operates as a front-end to dpkg(1), the low-level debian
       package handling tool. It features a full-screen package selections
       manager with package depends and conflicts resolver. When run with
       administrator privileges, packages can be installed, upgraded and
       removed. Various access methods can be configured to retrieve
       available package version information and installable packages from
       package repositories.  Depending on the used access method, these
       repositories can be public archive servers on the internet, local
       archive servers or cdroms.  The recommended access method is apt,
       which is provided by the package apt.
       Normally dselect is invoked without parameters. An interactive menu
       is presented, offering the user a list of commands. If a command is
       given as argument, then that command is started immediately. Several
       command line parameters are still available to modify the running
       behaviour of dselect or show additional information about the
       program.
