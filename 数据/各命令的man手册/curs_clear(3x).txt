       The erase and werase routines copy blanks to every position in the
       window, clearing the screen.
       The clear and wclear routines are like erase and werase, but they
       also call clearok, so that the screen is cleared completely on the
       next call to wrefresh for that window and repainted from scratch.
       The clrtobot and wclrtobot routines erase from the cursor to the end
       of screen.  That is, they erase all lines below the cursor in the
       window.  Also, the current line to the right of the cursor,
       inclusive, is erased.
       The clrtoeol and wclrtoeol routines erase the current line to the
       right of the cursor, inclusive, to the end of the current line.
       Blanks created by erasure have the current background rendition (as
       set by wbkgdset) merged into them.
