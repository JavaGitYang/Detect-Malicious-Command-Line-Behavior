       gettid() returns the caller's thread ID (TID).  In a single-threaded
       process, the thread ID is equal to the process ID (PID, as returned
       by getpid(2)).  In a multithreaded process, all threads have the same
       PID, but each one has a unique TID.  For further details, see the
       discussion of CLONE_THREAD in clone(2).
