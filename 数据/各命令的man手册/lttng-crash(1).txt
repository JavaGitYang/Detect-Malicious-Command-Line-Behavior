       The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation <http://lttng.org/> is an
       open source software package used for correlated tracing of the Linux
       kernel, user applications, and user libraries.
       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and
       dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and library
       tracing).
       The lttng-crash command-line tool is used to recover and view LTTng
       trace buffers in the event of a system crash.
