       The fdopen() function shall associate a stream with a file
       descriptor.
       The mode argument is a character string having one of the following
       values:
       r or rb       Open a file for reading.
       w or wb       Open a file for writing.
       a or ab       Open a file for writing at end-of-file.
       r+ or rb+ or r+b
                     Open a file for update (reading and writing).
       w+ or wb+ or w+b
                     Open a file for update (reading and writing).
       a+ or ab+ or a+b
                     Open a file for update (reading and writing) at end-of-
                     file.
       The meaning of these flags is exactly as specified in fopen(), except
       that modes beginning with w shall not cause truncation of the file.
       Additional values for the mode argument may be supported by an
       implementation.
       The application shall ensure that the mode of the stream as expressed
       by the mode argument is allowed by the file access mode of the open
       file description to which fildes refers. The file position indicator
       associated with the new stream is set to the position indicated by
       the file offset associated with the file descriptor.
       The error and end-of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.
       The fdopen() function may cause the last data access timestamp of the
       underlying file to be marked for update.
       If fildes refers to a shared memory object, the result of the
       fdopen() function is unspecified.
       If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the fdopen()
       function is unspecified.
       The fdopen() function shall preserve the offset maximum previously
       set for the open file description corresponding to fildes.
