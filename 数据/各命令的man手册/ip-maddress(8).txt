       maddress objects are multicast addresses.
   ip maddress show - list multicast addresses
       dev NAME (default)
              the device name.
       ip maddress add - add a multicast address
       ip maddress delete - delete a multicast address
              These commands attach/detach a static link-layer multicast
              address to listen on the interface.  Note that it is
              impossible to join protocol multicast groups statically. This
              command only manages link-layer addresses.
              address LLADDRESS (default)
                     the link-layer multicast address.
              dev NAME
                     the device to join/leave this multicast address.
