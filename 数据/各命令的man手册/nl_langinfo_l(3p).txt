       The nl_langinfo() and nl_langinfo_l() functions shall return a
       pointer to a string containing information relevant to the particular
       language or cultural area defined in the current locale, or in the
       locale represented by locale, respectively (see <langinfo.h>).  The
       manifest constant names and values of item are defined in
       <langinfo.h>.  For example:
           nl_langinfo(ABDAY_1)
       would return a pointer to the string "Dom" if the identified language
       was Portuguese, and "Sun" if the identified language was English.
           nl_langinfo_l(ABDAY_1, loc)
       would return a pointer to the string "Dom" if the identified language
       of the locale represented by loc was Portuguese, and "Sun" if the
       identified language of the locale represented by loc was English.
       The nl_langinfo() function need not be thread-safe.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to nl_langinfo_l()
       is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid
       locale object handle.
