       If status is non zero, this function will order gnutls not to send
       the rdnSequence in the certificate request message. That is the
       server will not advertise its trusted CAs to the peer. If status is
       zero then the default behaviour will take effect, which is to
       advertise the server's trusted CAs.
       This function has no effect in clients, and in authentication methods
       other than certificate with X.509 certificates.
