       This function will provide information on the MAC algorithm used in a
       PKCS 12 structure. If the structure algorithms are unknown the code
       GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_HASH_ALGORITHM will be returned, and only  oid ,
       will be set. That is,  oid will be set on structures with a MAC
       whether supported or not. It must be deinitialized using
       gnutls_free().  The other variables are only set on supported
       structures.
