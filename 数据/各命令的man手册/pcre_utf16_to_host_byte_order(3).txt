       This function, which exists only in the 16-bit library, converts a
       UTF-16 string to the correct order for the current host, taking
       account of any byte order marks (BOMs) within the string. Its
       arguments are:
         output           pointer to output buffer, may be the same as input
         input            pointer to input buffer
         length           number of 16-bit units in the input, or negative
       for
                            a zero-terminated string
         host_byte_order  a NULL value or a non-zero value pointed to means
                            start in host byte order
         keep_boms        if non-zero, BOMs are copied to the output string
       The result of the function is the number of 16-bit units placed into
       the output buffer, including the zero terminator if the string was
       zero-terminated.
       If host_byte_order is not NULL, it is set to indicate the byte order
       that is current at the end of the string.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
