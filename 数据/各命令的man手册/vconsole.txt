       The /etc/vconsole.conf file configures the virtual console, i.e.
       keyboard mapping and console font. It is applied at boot by udev
       using 90-vconsole.rules file. You can safely mask this file if you
       want to avoid this kind of initialization.
       The basic file format of the vconsole.conf is a newline-separated
       list of environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is
       possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however,
       beyond mere variable assignments no shell features are supported,
       allowing applications to read the file without implementing a shell
       compatible execution engine.
       Note that the kernel command line options vconsole.keymap=,
       vconsole.keymap_toggle=, vconsole.font=, vconsole.font_map=,
       vconsole.font_unimap= may be used to override the console settings at
       boot.
       Depending on the operating system other configuration files might be
       checked for configuration of the virtual console as well, however
       only as fallback.
       /etc/vconsole.conf is usually created and updated using
       systemd-localed.service(8).  localectl(1) may be used to instruct
       systemd-localed.service to query or update configuration.
