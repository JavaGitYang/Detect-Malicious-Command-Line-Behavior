       yum-debug-dump is a program which creates a gzipped file containing a
       lot of information useful to developers trying to debug a problem.
       By default it will output a file to the current working directory
       named yum_debug_dump-<hostname>-<time>.txt.gz. This file contains no
       private information but does contain a complete list of all packages
       you have installed, all packages available in any repository,
       important configuration and system information.  You can view this
       file using the 'zless' command.
       You can use the coresponding program yum-debug-restore to act on this
       file and restore a set of packages (much like dump/restore).
