       pam_lastlog is a PAM module to display a line of information about
       the last login of the user. In addition, the module maintains the
       /var/log/lastlog file.
       Some applications may perform this function themselves. In such
       cases, this module is not necessary.
       If the module is called in the auth or account phase, the accounts
       that were not used recently enough will be disallowed to log in. The
       check is not performed for the root account so the root is never
       locked out.
