       The rmdel utility shall remove the delta specified by the SID from
       each named SCCS file. The delta to be removed shall be the most
       recent delta in its branch in the delta chain of each named SCCS
       file. In addition, the application shall ensure that the SID
       specified is not that of a version being edited for the purpose of
       making a delta; that is, if a p-file (see get(1p)) exists for the
       named SCCS file, the SID specified shall not appear in any entry of
       the p-file.
       Removal of a delta shall be restricted to:
        1. The user who made the delta
        2. The owner of the SCCS file
        3. The owner of the directory containing the SCCS file
