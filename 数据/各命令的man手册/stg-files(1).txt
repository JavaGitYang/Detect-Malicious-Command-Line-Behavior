       List the files modified by the given patch (defaulting to the current
       one). Passing the --stat option shows the diff statistics for the
       given patch. Note that this command doesnâ€™t show the files modified
       in the working tree and not yet included in the patch by a refresh
       command. Use the diff or status commands for these files.
