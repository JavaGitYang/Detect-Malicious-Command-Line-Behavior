       The shm_unlink() function shall remove the name of the shared memory
       object named by the string pointed to by name.
       If one or more references to the shared memory object exist when the
       object is unlinked, the name shall be removed before shm_unlink()
       returns, but the removal of the memory object contents shall be
       postponed until all open and map references to the shared memory
       object have been removed.
       Even if the object continues to exist after the last shm_unlink(),
       reuse of the name shall subsequently cause shm_open() to behave as if
       no shared memory object of this name exists (that is, shm_open() will
       fail if O_CREAT is not set, or will create a new shared memory object
       if O_CREAT is set).
