       The pthread_attr_setstacksize() function sets the stack size
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in stacksize.
       The stack size attribute determines the minimum size (in bytes) that
       will be allocated for threads created using the thread attributes
       object attr.
       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() function returns the stack size
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the
       buffer pointed to by stacksize.
