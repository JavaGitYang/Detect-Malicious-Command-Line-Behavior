       This command outputs the length of an iso9660 filesystem that is
       contained in the specified file.  This file may be a normal file or a
       block device (e.g. /dev/hdd or /dev/sr0).  In the absence of any
       options (and errors), it will output the size of the iso9660
       filesystem in bytes.  This can now be a large number (>> 4 GB).
