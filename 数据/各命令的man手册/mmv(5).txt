       The files in $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv are generated either by the
       mmv_stats_init(3) and mmv_stats2_init(3) functions from the
       libpcp_mmv library, or by a native language module such as Parfait
       (Java), Speed (Golang) or Hornet (Rust).
       There could be multiple files in this directory, each file
       representing a single source of the performance metrics.  The metrics
       are harvested by pmdammv(1) which exports them to the rest of the
       Performance Co-Pilot infrastructure.
