       This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the user's
       PSK credentials.  The callback's function form is: int
       (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, const char* username, gnutls_datum_t*
       key);
        username contains the actual username.  The  key must be filled in
       using the gnutls_malloc().
       In case the callback returned a negative number then gnutls will
       assume that the username does not exist.
       The callback function will only be called once per handshake.  The
       callback function should return 0 on success, while -1 indicates an
       error.
