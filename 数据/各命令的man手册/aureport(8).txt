       aureport is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit system
       logs. The aureport utility can also take input from stdin as long as
       the input is the raw log data. The reports have a column label at the
       top to help with interpretation of the various fields. Except for the
       main summary report, all reports have the audit event number. You can
       subsequently lookup the full event with ausearch -a event number. You
       may need to specify start & stop times if you get multiple hits. The
       reports produced by aureport can be used as building blocks for more
       complicated analysis.
