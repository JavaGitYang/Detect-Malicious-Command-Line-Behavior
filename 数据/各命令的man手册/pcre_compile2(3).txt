       This function compiles a regular expression into an internal form. It
       is the same as pcre[16|32]_compile(), except for the addition of the
       errorcodeptr argument. The arguments are:
         pattern       A zero-terminated string containing the
                         regular expression to be compiled
         options       Zero or more option bits
         errorcodeptr  Where to put an error code
         errptr        Where to put an error message
         erroffset     Offset in pattern where error was found
         tableptr      Pointer to character tables, or NULL to
                         use the built-in default
       The option bits are:
         PCRE_ANCHORED           Force pattern anchoring
         PCRE_AUTO_CALLOUT       Compile automatic callouts
         PCRE_BSR_ANYCRLF        \R matches only CR, LF, or CRLF
         PCRE_BSR_UNICODE        \R matches all Unicode line endings
         PCRE_CASELESS           Do caseless matching
         PCRE_DOLLAR_ENDONLY     $ not to match newline at end
         PCRE_DOTALL             . matches anything including NL
         PCRE_DUPNAMES           Allow duplicate names for subpatterns
         PCRE_EXTENDED           Ignore white space and # comments
         PCRE_EXTRA              PCRE extra features
                                   (not much use currently)
         PCRE_FIRSTLINE          Force matching to be before newline
         PCRE_JAVASCRIPT_COMPAT  JavaScript compatibility
         PCRE_MULTILINE          ^ and $ match newlines within data
         PCRE_NEVER_UTF          Lock out UTF, e.g. via (*UTF)
         PCRE_NEWLINE_ANY        Recognize any Unicode newline sequence
         PCRE_NEWLINE_ANYCRLF    Recognize CR, LF, and CRLF as newline
                                   sequences
         PCRE_NEWLINE_CR         Set CR as the newline sequence
         PCRE_NEWLINE_CRLF       Set CRLF as the newline sequence
         PCRE_NEWLINE_LF         Set LF as the newline sequence
         PCRE_NO_AUTO_CAPTURE    Disable numbered capturing paren-
                                   theses (named ones available)
         PCRE_NO_AUTO_POSSESS    Disable auto-possessification
         PCRE_NO_START_OPTIMIZE  Disable match-time start optimizations
         PCRE_NO_UTF16_CHECK     Do not check the pattern for UTF-16
                                   validity (only relevant if
                                   PCRE_UTF16 is set)
         PCRE_NO_UTF32_CHECK     Do not check the pattern for UTF-32
                                   validity (only relevant if
                                   PCRE_UTF32 is set)
         PCRE_NO_UTF8_CHECK      Do not check the pattern for UTF-8
                                   validity (only relevant if
                                   PCRE_UTF8 is set)
         PCRE_UCP                Use Unicode properties for \d, \w, etc.
         PCRE_UNGREEDY           Invert greediness of quantifiers
         PCRE_UTF16              Run pcre16_compile() in UTF-16 mode
         PCRE_UTF32              Run pcre32_compile() in UTF-32 mode
         PCRE_UTF8               Run pcre_compile() in UTF-8 mode
       PCRE must be built with UTF support in order to use PCRE_UTF8/16/32
       and PCRE_NO_UTF8/16/32_CHECK, and with UCP support if PCRE_UCP is
       used.
       The yield of the function is a pointer to a private data structure
       that contains the compiled pattern, or NULL if an error was detected.
       Note that compiling regular expressions with one version of PCRE for
       use with a different version is not guaranteed to work and may cause
       crashes.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
