       The zbxpcp loadable module extends Zabbix agent by making Performance
       Co-Pilot (PCP) metrics available to it.  With the zbxpcp module
       configured in zabbix_agentd.conf all the PCP metrics are available
       from the Zabbix agent like any other agent items.  As a loadable
       module (DSO) zbxpcp does not rely on any external programs but
       directly uses the PCP APIs to fetch PCP metrics when requested.
       A typical Linux PCP installation offers over 1,000 metrics by default
       and is in turn extensible with its own plugins, or PMDAs
       (``Performance Metrics Domain Agents'').  In addition to very
       complete /proc based statistics, readily available PCP PMDAs provide
       support for such system and application level components as 389
       Directory Server, Apache, containers, HAProxy, GFS2, Gluster,
       libvirt, MySQL, NFS, Oracle, Postfix, PostgreSQL, Samba, and
       Sendmail, among others.  PCP also runs on many platforms, including
       Linux, Mac OS X, FreeBSD, NetBSD, Solaris, and Windows.
       For PCP introduction, see PCPIntro(1).  To investigate the available
       PCP metrics, use for example pminfo(1).  The PCP Quick Reference
       Guide is available at the PCP home page http://pcp.io/.

       zbxpcp is compatible with the Zabbix module API version 1.
