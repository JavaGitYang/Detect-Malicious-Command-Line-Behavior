       The io_cancel() system call attempts to cancel an asynchronous I/O
       operation previously submitted with io_submit(2).  The iocb argument
       describes the operation to be canceled and the ctx_id argument is the
       AIO context to which the operation was submitted.  If the operation
       is successfully canceled, the event will be copied into the memory
       pointed to by result without being placed into the completion queue.
