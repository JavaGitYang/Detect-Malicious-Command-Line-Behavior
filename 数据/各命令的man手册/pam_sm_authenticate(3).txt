       The pam_sm_authenticate function is the service module's
       implementation of the pam_authenticate(3) interface.
       This function performs the task of authenticating the user.
       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           Return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the database of authentication tokens for
           this authentication mechanism has a NULL entry for the user.
           Without this flag, such a NULL token will lead to a success
           without the user being prompted.
