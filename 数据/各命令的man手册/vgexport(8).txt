       vgexport makes inactive VGs unknown to the system. In this state, all
       the PVs in the VG can be moved to a different system, from which
       vgimport(8) can then be run.
       Most LVM tools ignore exported VGs.
       vgexport clears the VG system ID, and vgimport sets the VG system ID
       to match the host running vgimport (if the host has a system ID).
