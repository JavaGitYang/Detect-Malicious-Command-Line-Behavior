       sd_journal_enumerate_fields() may be used to iterate through all
       field names used in the opened journal files. On each invocation the
       next field name is returned. The order of the returned field names is
       not defined. It takes two arguments: the journal context object, plus
       a pointer to a constant string pointer where the field name is stored
       in. The returned data is in a read-only memory map and is only valid
       until the next invocation of sd_journal_enumerate_fields(). Note that
       this call is subject to the data field size threshold as controlled
       by sd_journal_set_data_threshold().
       sd_journal_restart_fields() resets the field name enumeration index
       to the beginning of the list. The next invocation of
       sd_journal_enumerate_fields() will return the first field name again.
       The SD_JOURNAL_FOREACH_FIELD() macro may be used as a handy wrapper
       around sd_journal_restart_fields() and sd_journal_enumerate_fields().
       These functions currently are not influenced by matches set with
       sd_journal_add_match() but this might change in a later version of
       this software.
       To retrieve the possible values a specific field can take use
       sd_journal_query_unique(3).
