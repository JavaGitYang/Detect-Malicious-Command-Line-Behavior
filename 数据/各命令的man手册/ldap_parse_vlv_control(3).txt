       The ldap_parse_vlv_control is used to decode the information returned
       from a search operation that used a VLV (virtual list view)control.
       It takes a null terminated array of LDAPControl structures, usually
       obtained by a call to the ldap_parse_resultfunction, a target_pos
       which points to the list index of the target entry. If this parameter
       is NULL, the target position is not returned. The index returned is
       an approximation of the position of the target entry. It is not
       guaranteed to be exact. The parameter list_countp points to the
       server's estimate of the size of the list. If this parameter is NULL,
       the size is not returned. contextp is a pointer to the address of a
       berval structure that contains a server-generated context identifier
       if server returns one. If server does not return a context
       identifier, the server returns a NULL in this parameter. If this
       parameter is set to NULL, the context identifier is not returned. You
       should use this returned context in the next call to create a VLV
       control. When the berval structure is no longer needed, you should
       free the memory by calling the ber_bvfree function.e errcodep is an
       output parameter, which points to the result code returned by the
       server. If this parameter is NULL, the result code is not returned.
       See ldap.h for a list of possible return codes.
