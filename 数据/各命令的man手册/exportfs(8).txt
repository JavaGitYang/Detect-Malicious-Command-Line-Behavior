       An NFS server maintains a table of local physical file systems that
       are accessible to NFS clients.  Each file system in this table is
       referred to as an exported file system, or export, for short.
       The exportfs command maintains the current table of exports for the
       NFS server.  The master export table is kept in a file named
       /var/lib/nfs/etab.  This file is read by rpc.mountd when a client
       sends an NFS MOUNT request.
       Normally the master export table is initialized with the contents of
       /etc/exports and files under /etc/exports.d by invoking exportfs -a.
       However, a system administrator can choose to add or delete exports
       without modifying /etc/exports or files under /etc/exports.d by using
       the exportfs command.
       exportfs and its partner program rpc.mountd work in one of two modes:
       a legacy mode which applies to 2.4 and earlier versions of the Linux
       kernel, and a new mode which applies to 2.6 and later versions,
       providing the nfsd virtual filesystem has been mounted at
       /proc/fs/nfsd or /proc/fs/nfs.  On 2.6 kernels, if this filesystem is
       not mounted, the legacy mode is used.
       In the new mode, exportfs does not give any information to the
       kernel, but provides it only to rpc.mountd through the
       /var/lib/nfs/etab file.  rpc.mountd then manages kernel requests for
       information about exports, as needed.
       In the legacy mode, exports which identify a specific host, rather
       than a subnet or netgroup, are entered directly into the kernel's
       export table, as well as being written to /var/lib/nfs/etab.
       Further, exports listed in /var/lib/nfs/rmtab which match a non host-
       specific export request will cause an appropriate export entry for
       the host given in rmtab to be added to the kernel's export table.
