     rpcinfo makes an RPC call to an RPC server and reports what it finds.
     In the first synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the registered RPC services
     with rpcbind on host.  If host is not specified, the local host is the
     default.  If -s is used, the information is displayed in a concise for‐
     mat.
     In the second synopsis, rpcinfo lists all the RPC services registered
     with rpcbind, version 2.  Also note that the format of the information
     is different in the first and the second synopsis.  This is because the
     second synopsis is an older protocol used to collect the information
     displayed (version 2 of the rpcbind protocol).
     The third synopsis makes an RPC call to procedure 0 of prognum and
     versnum on the specified host and reports whether a response was
     received.  transport is the transport which has to be used for contact‐
     ing the given service.  The remote address of the service is obtained
     by making a call to the remote rpcbind.
     The prognum argument is a number that represents an RPC program number.
     If a versnum is specified, rpcinfo attempts to call that version of the
     specified prognum.  Otherwise, rpcinfo attempts to find all the regis‐
     tered version numbers for the specified prognum by calling version 0,
     which is presumed not to exist; if it does exist, rpcinfo attempts to
     obtain this information by calling an extremely high version number
     instead, and attempts to call each registered version.  Note: the ver‐
     sion number is required for -b and -d options.
