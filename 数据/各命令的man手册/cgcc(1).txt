       cgcc provides a wrapper around a C compiler (cc by default) which
       also invokes the Sparse static analysis tool.
       cgcc accepts all Sparse command-line options, such as warning
       options, and passes all other options through to the compiler.
       By providing the same interface as the C compiler, cgcc allows
       projects to run Sparse as part of their build without modifying their
       build system, by using cgcc as the compiler.  For many projects,
       setting CC=cgcc on the make command-line will work.
