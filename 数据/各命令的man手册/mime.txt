       The mime.convs file defines the filters that are available for
       converting files from one format to another.  The standard filters
       support text, PDF, PostScript, and many types of image files.
       Additional filters are specified in files with the extension .convs
       in the CUPS configuration directory.
       Each line in the mime.convs file is a comment, blank, or filter line.
       Comment lines start with the # character.  Filter lines specify the
       source and destination MIME types along with a relative cost
       associated with the filter and the filter to run:
           source/type destination/type cost filter
       The source/type field specifies the source MIME media type that is
       consumed by the filter.
       The destination/type field specifies the destination MIME media type
       that is produced by the filter.
       The cost field specifies the relative cost for running the filter.  A
       value of 100 means that the filter uses a large amount of resources
       while a value of 0 means that the filter uses very few resources.
       The filter field specifies the filter program filename.  Filenames
       are relative to the CUPS filter directory.
