       curvetun is a lightweight, high-speed ECDH multiuser IP tunnel for
       Linux that is based on epoll(2). curvetun uses the Linux TUN/TAP
       interface and supports {IPv4, IPv6} over {IPv4, IPv6} with UDP or TCP
       as carrier protocols.
       It has an integrated packet forwarding tree, thus multiple users with
       different IPs can be handled via a single tunnel device on the server
       side, and flows are scheduled for processing in a CPU efficient way,
       at least in the case of TCP as the carrier protocol.
       For key management, public-key cryptography based on elliptic curves
       are used and packets are encrypted end-to-end by the symmetric stream
       cipher Salsa20 and authenticated by the MAC Poly1305, where keys have
       previously been computed with the ECDH key agreement protocol
       Curve25519.
       Cryptography is based on Daniel J. Bernstein's networking and
       cryptography library “NaCl”. By design, curvetun does not provide any
       particular pattern or default port numbers that gives certainty that
       the connection from a particular flow is actually running curvetun.
       However, if you have a further need to bypass censorship, you can try
       using curvetun in combination with Tor's obfsproxy or Telex.
       Furthermore, curvetun also protects you against replay attacks and DH
       man-in-the-middle attacks.  Additionally, server-side syslog event
       logging can also be disabled to avoid revealing critical user
       connection data.
