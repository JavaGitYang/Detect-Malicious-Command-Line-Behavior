       A Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive consists of multiple files as
       created by pmlogger(1).  pmlogmv allows all the files of a single PCP
       archive to be moved or renamed as a group in a single operation.
       The oldname argument identifies the target archive, and may be either
       the basename that is common to all files in that archive or one of
       the archive's files.  The new archive's basename is newname.
       The -N option performs a dry-run, checking and reporting what changes
       would be made without making any changes.
       Additional reporting verbosity may be requested with the -V option.
       Because PCP archives are important records of system activity,
       special care is taken to ensure the integrity of an archive's files.
       For recoverable problems encountered during the execution of pmlogmv,
       all the files associated with oldname will be preserved, and no new
       files with the newname prefix will be created.  ``Recoverable
       problems'' include signals that can be caught (such as SIGHUP,
       SIGINT, SIGQUIT and SIGTERM), permissions issues, new files already
       existing, file system full events, etc.
       The implementation of pmlogmv uses hard links in the file system and
       so follows the semantic restrictions of ln(2) which for most systems
       means the directories containing both the oldname and the newname PCP
       archive files need to be writeable and within the same file system.
