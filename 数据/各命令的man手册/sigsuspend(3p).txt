       The sigsuspend() function shall replace the current signal mask of
       the calling thread with the set of signals pointed to by sigmask and
       then suspend the thread until delivery of a signal whose action is
       either to execute a signal-catching function or to terminate the
       process. This shall not cause any other signals that may have been
       pending on the process to become pending on the thread.
       If the action is to terminate the process then sigsuspend() shall
       never return. If the action is to execute a signal-catching function,
       then sigsuspend() shall return after the signal-catching function
       returns, with the signal mask restored to the set that existed prior
       to the sigsuspend() call.
       It is not possible to block signals that cannot be ignored. This is
       enforced by the system without causing an error to be indicated.
