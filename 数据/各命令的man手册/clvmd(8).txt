       clvmd is the daemon that distributes LVM metadata updates around a
       cluster.  It must be running on all nodes in the cluster and will
       give an error if a node in the cluster does not have this daemon
       running.
       Also see lvmlockd(8) for a newer method of using LVM on shared
       storage.
