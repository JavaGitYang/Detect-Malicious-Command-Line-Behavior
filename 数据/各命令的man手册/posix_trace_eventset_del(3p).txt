       These primitives manipulate sets of trace event types. They operate
       on data objects addressable by the application, not on the current
       trace event filter of any trace stream.
       The posix_trace_eventset_add() and posix_trace_eventset_del()
       functions, respectively, shall add or delete the individual trace
       event type specified by the value of the argument event_id to or from
       the trace event type set pointed to by the argument set.  Adding a
       trace event type already in the set or deleting a trace event type
       not in the set shall not be considered an error.
       The posix_trace_eventset_empty() function shall initialize the trace
       event type set pointed to by the set argument such that all trace
       event types defined, both system and user, shall be excluded from the
       set.
       The posix_trace_eventset_fill() function shall initialize the trace
       event type set pointed to by the argument set, such that the set of
       trace event types defined by the argument what shall be included in
       the set. The value of the argument what shall consist of one of the
       following values, as defined in the <trace.h> header:
       POSIX_TRACE_WOPID_EVENTS
             All the process-independent implementation-defined system trace
             event types are included in the set.
       POSIX_TRACE_SYSTEM_EVENTS
             All the implementation-defined system trace event types are
             included in the set, as are those defined in POSIX.1‚Äê2008.
       POSIX_TRACE_ALL_EVENTS
             All trace event types defined, both system and user, are
             included in the set.
       Applications shall call either posix_trace_eventset_empty() or
       posix_trace_eventset_fill() at least once for each object of type
       trace_event_set_t prior to any other use of that object. If such an
       object is not initialized in this way, but is nonetheless supplied as
       an argument to any of the posix_trace_eventset_add(),
       posix_trace_eventset_del(), or posix_trace_eventset_ismember()
       functions, the results are undefined.
       The posix_trace_eventset_ismember() function shall test whether the
       trace event type specified by the value of the argument event_id is a
       member of the set pointed to by the argument set.  The value returned
       in the object pointed to by ismember argument is zero if the trace
       event type identifier is not a member of the set and a value
       different from zero if it is a member of the set.
