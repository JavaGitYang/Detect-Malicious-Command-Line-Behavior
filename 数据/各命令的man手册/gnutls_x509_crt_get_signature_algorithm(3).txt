       This function will return a value of the gnutls_sign_algorithm_t
       enumeration that is the signature algorithm that has been used to
       sign this certificate.
       Since 3.6.0 this function never returns a negative error code.  Error
       cases and unknown/unsupported signature algorithms are mapped to
       GNUTLS_SIGN_UNKNOWN.
