       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wmemcpy() function shall copy n wide characters from the object
       pointed to by ws2 to the object pointed to by ws1.  This function
       shall not be affected by locale and all wchar_t values shall be
       treated identically. The null wide character and wchar_t values not
       corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated specially.
       If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and ws2 are valid
       pointers, and the function shall copy zero wide characters.
