       sd_bus_process() drives the connection between the message bus and
       the client. That is, it handles connecting, authentication, and
       message processing. It should be called in a loop until no further
       progress can be made or an error occurs.
       Once no further progress can be made, sd_bus_wait(3) should be
       called. Alternatively the user can wait for incoming data on the file
       descriptor returned by sd_bus_get_fd(3).
       sd_bus_process processes at most one incoming message per call. If
       the parameter r is not NULL and the call processed a message, *r is
       set to this message. The caller owns a reference to this message and
       should call sd_bus_message_unref(3) when the message is no longer
       needed. If r is not NULL, progress was made, but no message was
       processed, *r is set to NULL.
