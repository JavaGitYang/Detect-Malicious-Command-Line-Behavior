       The encoding of a performance metric's dimensionality and scale uses
       a pmUnits structure; see pmLookupDesc(3).
       As an aid to labeling graphs and tables, or for error messages,
       pmUnitsStr will take a dimension and scale specification as per pu,
       and return the corresponding text string.  The pmUnitsStr_r function
       does the same, but stores the result in a user-supplied buffer buf of
       length buflen, which should have room for at least 60 bytes.  If
       buflen is less than 60 then pmUnitsStr_r returns NULL and buf is not
       changed.
       For example {1, -2, 0, PM_SPACE_MBYTE, PM_TIME_SEC, 0}, as the value
       of *pu gives the result string Mbyte / sec^2.
       The string value result from pmUnitsStr is held in a single static
       buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the next call to
       pmUnitsStr.
       If the ``count'' dimension is non-zero, and the ``count'' scale is
       not zero, then the text string will include a decimal scaling factor,
       eg.  count x 10^6.
       As a special case, if all components of the dimension are zero, then
       the ``count'' scale is used to produce the text.  If this scale is
       zero the result is an empty string, otherwise the result is of the
       form x1 0^2.
