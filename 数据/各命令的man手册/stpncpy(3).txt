       The stpncpy() function copies at most n characters from the string
       pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte ('\0'), to the
       array pointed to by dest.  Exactly n characters are written at dest.
       If the length strlen(src) is smaller than n, the remaining characters
       in the array pointed to by dest are filled with null bytes ('\0'), If
       the length strlen(src) is greater than or equal to n, the string
       pointed to by dest will not be null-terminated.
       The strings may not overlap.
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n
       characters at dest.
