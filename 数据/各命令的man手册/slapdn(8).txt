       Slapdn is used to check the conformance of a DN based on the schema
       defined in slapd(8) and that loaded via slapd.conf(5).  It opens the
       slapd.conf(5) configuration file or the slapd-config (5) backend,
       reads in the schema definitions, and then parses the DN list given on
       the command-line.
