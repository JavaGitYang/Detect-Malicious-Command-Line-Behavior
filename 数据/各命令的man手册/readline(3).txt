       readline will read a line from the terminal and return it, using
       prompt as a prompt.  If prompt is NULL or the empty string, no prompt
       is issued.  The line returned is allocated with malloc(3); the caller
       must free it when finished.  The line returned has the final newline
       removed, so only the text of the line remains.
       readline offers editing capabilities while the user is entering the
       line.  By default, the line editing commands are similar to those of
       emacs.  A vi-style line editing interface is also available.
       This manual page describes only the most basic use of readline.  Much
       more functionality is available; see The GNU Readline Library and The
       GNU History Library for additional information.
