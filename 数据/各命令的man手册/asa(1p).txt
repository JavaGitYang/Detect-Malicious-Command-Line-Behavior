       The asa utility shall write its input files to standard output,
       mapping carriage-control characters from the text files to line-
       printer control sequences in an implementation-defined manner.
       The first character of every line shall be removed from the input,
       and the following actions are performed.
       If the character removed is:
       <space>   The rest of the line is output without change.
       0         A <newline> is output, then the rest of the input line.
       1         One or more implementation-defined characters that causes
                 an advance to the next page shall be output, followed by
                 the rest of the input line.
       +         The <newline> of the previous line shall be replaced with
                 one or more implementation-defined characters that causes
                 printing to return to column position 1, followed by the
                 rest of the input line. If the '+' is the first character
                 in the input, it shall be equivalent to <space>.
       The action of the asa utility is unspecified upon encountering any
       character other than those listed above as the first character in a
       line.
