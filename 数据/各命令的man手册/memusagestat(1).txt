       memusagestat creates a PNG file containing a graphical representation
       of the memory profiling data in the file datafile; that file is
       generated via the -d (or --data) option of memusage(1).
       The red line in the graph shows the heap usage (allocated memory) and
       the green line shows the stack usage.  The x-scale is either the
       number of memory-handling function calls or (if the -t option is
       specified) time.
