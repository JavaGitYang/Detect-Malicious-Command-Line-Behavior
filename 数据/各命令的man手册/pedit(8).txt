       The pedit action can be used to change arbitrary packet data. The
       location of data to change can either be specified by giving an
       offset and size as in RAW_OP, or for header values by naming the
       header and field to edit the size is then chosen automatically based
       on the header field size. Currently this is supported only for IPv4
       headers.
