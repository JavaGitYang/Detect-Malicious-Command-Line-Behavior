       The mkfifo utility shall create the FIFO special files specified by
       the operands, in the order specified.
       For each file operand, the mkfifo utility shall perform actions
       equivalent to the mkfifo() function defined in the System Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008, called with the following arguments:
        1. The file operand is used as the path argument.
        2. The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR, S_IWUSR,
           S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is used as the mode
           argument. (If the −m option is specified, the value of the
           mkfifo() mode argument is unspecified, but the FIFO shall at no
           time have permissions less restrictive than the −m mode option-
           argument.)
