       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaAttribute is the generic callback for responding to
       client connection attributes.  These attributes include client
       credential information, such as user ID and group ID.
       A PMDA that supports connection attributes will provide a private
       pmdaAttribute callback by assignment to version.six.attribute of the
       pmdaInterface structure, and implement custom logic for any of the
       attribute key-value pairs of interest to it.
       All attributes are associated with a specific client context, and
       these can be uniquely identified using the ctx first argument.  The
       PMDA should track client connections, and disconnections using the
       pmdaSetEndContextCallBack(3) interface, as a result.  The
       pmdaGetContext(3) interface may be particularly helpful also.
       All attributes are passed as key-value pairs and the value is always
       passed as a null-terminated string of given length.  This includes
       numeric attributes like the user ID.
       The most commonly used attributes would be PCP_ATTR_USERID and
       PCP_ATTR_GROUPID but others may also be optionally passed (such as
       PCP_ATTR_USERNAME) if they are available.  Some attributes will be
       consumed by pmcd and never through passed to PMDAs, such as
       PCP_ATTR_PASSWORD.  A complete list of all possible attributes can be
       found in the headers listed above, all are prefixed by PCP_ATTR.
