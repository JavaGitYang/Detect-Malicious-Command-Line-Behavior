       pmParseTimeWindow is designed to encapsulate the interpretation of
       the -S, -T, -A and -O command line options used by Performance Co-
       Pilot (PCP) applications to define a time window of interest.  The
       time window is defined by a start time and an end time that
       constrains the time interval during which the PCP application will
       retrieve and display performance metrics.  In the absence of the -O
       and -A options to specify an initial sample time origin and time
       alignment (see below), the PCP application will retrieve the first
       sample at the start of the time window.
       The syntax and meaning of the various argument formats for these
       options is described in PCPIntro(1).
