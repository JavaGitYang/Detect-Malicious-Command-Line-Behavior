       pcap_file() returns the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile,'' if a
       ``savefile'' was opened with pcap_open_offline(), or NULL, if a
       network device was opened with pcap_create() and pcap_activate(), or
       with pcap_open_live().
       Note that the Packet Capture library is usually built with large file
       support, so the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile'' might refer
       to a file larger than 2 gigabytes; applications that use pcap_file()
       should, if possible, use calls that support large files on the return
       value of pcap_file() or the value returned by fileno() when passed
       the return value of pcap_file().
