       __ppc_get_timebase() reads the current value of the Time Base
       Register and returns its value, while __ppc_get_timebase_freq()
       returns the frequency in which the Time Base Register is updated.
       The Time Base Register is a 64-bit register provided by Power
       Architecture processors.  It stores a monotonically incremented value
       that is updated at a system-dependent frequency that may be different
       from the processor frequency.
