       pam_listfile is a PAM module which provides a way to deny or allow
       services based on an arbitrary file.
       The module gets the item of the type specified -- user specifies the
       username, PAM_USER; tty specifies the name of the terminal over which
       the request has been made, PAM_TTY; rhost specifies the name of the
       remote host (if any) from which the request was made, PAM_RHOST; and
       ruser specifies the name of the remote user (if available) who made
       the request, PAM_RUSER -- and looks for an instance of that item in
       the file=filename.  filename contains one line per item listed. If
       the item is found, then if sense=allow, PAM_SUCCESS is returned,
       causing the authorization request to succeed; else if sense=deny,
       PAM_AUTH_ERR is returned, causing the authorization request to fail.
       If an error is encountered (for instance, if filename does not exist,
       or a poorly-constructed argument is encountered), then if
       onerr=succeed, PAM_SUCCESS is returned, otherwise if onerr=fail,
       PAM_AUTH_ERR or PAM_SERVICE_ERR (as appropriate) will be returned.
       An additional argument, apply=, can be used to restrict the
       application of the above to a specific user (apply=username) or a
       given group (apply=@groupname). This added restriction is only
       meaningful when used with the tty, rhost and shell items.
       Besides this last one, all arguments should be specified; do not
       count on any default behavior.
       No credentials are awarded by this module.
