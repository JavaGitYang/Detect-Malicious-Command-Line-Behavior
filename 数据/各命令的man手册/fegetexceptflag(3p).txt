       The fegetexceptflag() function shall attempt to store an
       implementation-defined representation of the states of the floating-
       point status flags indicated by the argument excepts in the object
       pointed to by the argument flagp.
       The fesetexceptflag() function shall attempt to set the floating-
       point status flags indicated by the argument excepts to the states
       stored in the object pointed to by flagp.  The value pointed to by
       flagp shall have been set by a previous call to fegetexceptflag()
       whose second argument represented at least those floating-point
       exceptions represented by the argument excepts.  This function does
       not raise floating-point exceptions, but only sets the state of the
       flags.
