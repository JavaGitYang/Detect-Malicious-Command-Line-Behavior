       The mysql_tzinfo_to_sql program loads the time zone tables in the
       mysql database. It is used on systems that have a zoneinfo database
       (the set of files describing time zones). Examples of such systems
       are Linux, FreeBSD, Solaris, and Mac OS X. One likely location for
       these files is the /usr/share/zoneinfo directory
       (/usr/share/lib/zoneinfo on Solaris).
       mysql_tzinfo_to_sql can be invoked several ways:
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_dir
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_file tz_name
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap tz_file
       For the first invocation syntax, pass the zoneinfo directory path
       name to mysql_tzinfo_to_sql and send the output into the mysql
       program. For example:
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql /usr/share/zoneinfo | mysql -u root mysql
       mysql_tzinfo_to_sql reads your systemÂ´s time zone files and generates
       SQL statements from them.  mysql processes those statements to load
       the time zone tables.
       The second syntax causes mysql_tzinfo_to_sql to load a single time
       zone file tz_file that corresponds to a time zone name tz_name:
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql tz_file tz_name | mysql -u root mysql
       If your time zone needs to account for leap seconds, invoke
       mysql_tzinfo_to_sql using the third syntax, which initializes the
       leap second information.  tz_file is the name of your time zone file:
           shell> mysql_tzinfo_to_sql --leap tz_file | mysql -u root mysql
       After running mysql_tzinfo_to_sql, it is best to restart the server
       so that it does not continue to use any previously cached time zone
       data.
