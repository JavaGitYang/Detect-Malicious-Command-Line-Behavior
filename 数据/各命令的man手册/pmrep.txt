       pmrep is a customizable performance metrics reporting tool.  Any
       available performance metric, live or archived, system and/or
       application, can be selected for reporting using one of the available
       output alternatives together with applicable formatting options.
       The metrics of interest are named in the metricspec argument(s) on
       the pmrep command line.  These metricspecs define individual metrics
       or pre-defined performance metricsets to be read from the
       configuration file described below.  For command line argument
       details see pmrep(1).
       The pmrep.conf configuration file allows setting default runtime
       values and defining any number of custom metricsets for pmrep.  A
       metricset is a user-defined set of arbitrary performance metrics.
       This allows the user to create specifically crafted metricsets
       particularly relevant for their application or environment.  Instead
       of being dependent on what existing tools provide or collecting the
       needed data with several disjoint utilities the user can create and
       modify custom metricsets by editing pmrep.conf.  See below for the
       metricset specification.
       Options via environment values (see pmGetOptions(3)) override the
       corresponding built-in default values (if any).  Configuration file
       options override the corresponding environment variables (if any).
       Command line options override the corresponding configuration file
       options (if any).
