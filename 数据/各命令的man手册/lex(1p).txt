       The lex utility shall generate C programs to be used in lexical
       processing of character input, and that can be used as an interface
       to yacc.  The C programs shall be generated from lex source code and
       conform to the ISO C standard, without depending on any undefined,
       unspecified, or implementation-defined behavior, except in cases
       where the code is copied directly from the supplied source, or in
       cases that are documented by the implementation. Usually, the lex
       utility shall write the program it generates to the file lex.yy.c;
       the state of this file is unspecified if lex exits with a non-zero
       exit status. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section for a complete
       description of the lex input language.
