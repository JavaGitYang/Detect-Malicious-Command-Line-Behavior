       The tunnel_key action combined with a shared IP tunnel device, allows
       to perform IP tunnel en- or decapsulation on a packet, reflected by
       the operation modes UNSET and SET.  The UNSET mode is optional - even
       without using it, the metadata information will be released
       automatically when packet processing will be finished.  UNSET
       function could be used in cases when traffic is forwarded between two
       tunnels, where the metadata from the first tunnel will be used for
       encapsulation done by the second tunnel.  SET mode requires the
       source and destination ip ADDRESS and the tunnel key id KEY_ID which
       will be used by the ip tunnel shared device to create the tunnel
       header. The tunnel_key action is useful only in combination with a
       mirred redirect action to a shared IP tunnel device which will use
       the metadata (for SET ) and unset the metadata created by it (for
       UNSET ).
