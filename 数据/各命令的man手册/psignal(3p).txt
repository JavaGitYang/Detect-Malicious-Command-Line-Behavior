       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall print a message out on
       stderr associated with a signal number. If message is not null and is
       not the empty string, then the string pointed to by the message
       argument shall be printed first, followed by a <colon>, a <space>,
       and the signal description string indicated by signum, or by the
       signal associated with pinfo.  If the message argument is null or
       points to an empty string, then only the signal description shall be
       printed. For psiginfo(), the argument pinfo references a valid
       siginfo_t structure. For psignal(), if signum is not a valid signal
       number, the behavior is implementation-defined.
       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall not change the
       orientation of the standard error stream.
       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall mark for update the last
       data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file
       associated with the standard error stream at some time between their
       successful completion and exit(), abort(), or the completion of
       fflush() or fclose() on stderr.
       The psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall not change the setting
       of errno if successful.
       On error, the psiginfo() and psignal() functions shall set the error
       indicator for the stream to which stderr points, and shall set errno
       to indicate the error.
       Since no value is returned, an application wishing to check for error
       situations should set errno to 0, then call psiginfo() or psignal(),
       then check errno.
