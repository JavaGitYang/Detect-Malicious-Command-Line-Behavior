       The pam_access PAM module is mainly for access management. It
       provides logdaemon style login access control based on login names,
       host or domain names, internet addresses or network numbers, or on
       terminal line names, X $DISPLAY values, or PAM service names in case
       of non-networked logins.
       By default rules for access management are taken from config file
       /etc/security/access.conf if you don't specify another file.
       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report
       when it denies access based on origin (host, tty, etc.).
