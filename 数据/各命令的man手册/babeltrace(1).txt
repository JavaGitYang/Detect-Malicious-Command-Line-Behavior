       babeltrace is an open-source trace converter and processor. The tool
       can convert from one trace format to another, possibly with one or
       more filters in the conversion path, and perform other operations
       depending on the command CMD.
       See babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace project
       and its core concepts.
       Most of the babeltrace commands load Babeltrace plugins to perform
       their operation. The search path for Babeltrace plugins is, in this
       order:
        1. The colon-separated list of directories in the
           BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
        2. The colon-separated list of directories in the specific commandâ€™s
           --plugin-path option.
        3. $HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
        4. /usr/local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
       You can use the babeltrace-list-plugins(1) command to dynamically
       list the available plugins and what they offer. See PLUGINS for a
       list of plugins shipped with Babeltrace.
