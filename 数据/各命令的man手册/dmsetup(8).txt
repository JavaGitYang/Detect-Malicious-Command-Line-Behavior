       dmsetup manages logical devices that use the device-mapper driver.
       Devices are created by loading a table that specifies a target for
       each sector (512 bytes) in the logical device.
       The first argument to dmsetup is a command.  The second argument is
       the logical device name or uuid.
       Invoking the dmsetup tool as devmap_name (which is not normally
       distributed and is supported only for historical reasons) is
       equivalent to dmsetup info -c --noheadings -j major -m minor.
