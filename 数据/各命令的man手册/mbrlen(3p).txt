       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       If s is not a null pointer, mbrlen() shall determine the number of
       bytes constituting the character pointed to by s.  It shall be
       equivalent to:
           mbstate_t internal;
           mbrtowc(NULL, s, n, ps != NULL ? ps : &internal);
       If ps is a null pointer, the mbrlen() function shall use its own
       internal mbstate_t object, which is initialized at program start-up
       to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the mbstate_t object
       pointed to by ps shall be used to completely describe the current
       conversion state of the associated character sequence. The
       implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008 calls mbrlen().
       The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of
       the current locale.
       The mbrlen() function need not be thread-safe if called with a NULL
       ps argument.
       The mbrlen() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
