       The fstatvfs() function shall obtain information about the file
       system containing the file referenced by fildes.
       The statvfs() function shall obtain information about the file system
       containing the file named by path.
       For both functions, the buf argument is a pointer to a statvfs
       structure that shall be filled. Read, write, or execute permission of
       the named file is not required.
       The following flags can be returned in the f_flag member:
       ST_RDONLY   Read-only file system.
       ST_NOSUID   Setuid/setgid bits ignored by exec.
       It is unspecified whether all members of the statvfs structure have
       meaningful values on all file systems.
