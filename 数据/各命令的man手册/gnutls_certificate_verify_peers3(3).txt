       This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the the
       status in the  status variable as a bitwise OR of
       gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
       trusted. Note that value in  status is set only when the return value
       of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a certificate does
       not imply a negative return value).  The default verification flags
       used by this function can be overridden using
       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags(). See the documentation of
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2() for details in the verification
       process.
       If the  hostname provided is non-NULL then this function will compare
       the hostname in the certificate against it. The comparison will
       follow the RFC6125 recommendations. If names do not match the
       GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER status flag will be set.
       In order to verify the purpose of the end-certificate (by checking
       the extended key usage), use gnutls_certificate_verify_peers().
