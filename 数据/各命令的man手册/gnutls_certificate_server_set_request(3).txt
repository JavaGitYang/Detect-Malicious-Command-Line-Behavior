       This function specifies if we (in case of a server) are going to send
       a certificate request message to the client. If  req is
       GNUTLS_CERT_REQUIRE then the server will return an error if the peer
       does not provide a certificate. If you do not call this function then
       the client will not be asked to send a certificate.
