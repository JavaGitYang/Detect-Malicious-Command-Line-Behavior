       cupsd is the scheduler for CUPS. It implements a printing system
       based upon the Internet Printing Protocol, version 2.1, and supports
       most of the requirements for IPP Everywhere. If no options are
       specified on the command-line then the default configuration file
       /etc/cups/cupsd.conf will be used.
