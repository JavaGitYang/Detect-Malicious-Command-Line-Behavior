       The pthread_spin_unlock() function shall release the spin lock
       referenced by lock which was locked via the pthread_spin_lock() or
       pthread_spin_trylock() functions.
       The results are undefined if the lock is not held by the calling
       thread.
       If there are threads spinning on the lock when pthread_spin_unlock()
       is called, the lock becomes available and an unspecified spinning
       thread shall acquire the lock.
       The results are undefined if this function is called with an
       uninitialized thread spin lock.
