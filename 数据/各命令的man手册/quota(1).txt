       quota displays users' disk usage and limits.  By default only the
       user quotas are printed. By default space usage and limits are shown
       in kbytes (and are named blocks for historical reasons).
       quota reports the quotas of all the filesystems listed in /etc/mtab.
       For filesystems that are NFS-mounted a call to the rpc.rquotad on the
       server machine is performed to get the information.
