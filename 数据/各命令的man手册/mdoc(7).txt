     The -mdoc package is a set of content-based and domain-based macros
     used to format the BSD man pages.  The macro names and their meanings
     are listed below for quick reference; for a detailed explanation on
     using the package, see groff_mdoc(7) and the tutorial sampler
     mdoc.samples(7).
     Note that this is not the usual macro package for Linux documentation,
     although it is used for documentation of several widely used programs;
     see man(7).
     The macros are described in two groups, the first includes the struc‚Äê
     tural and physical page layout macros.  The second contains the manual
     and general text domain macros which differentiate the -mdoc package
     from other troff formatting packages.
