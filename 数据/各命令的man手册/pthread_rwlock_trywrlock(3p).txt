       The pthread_rwlock_trywrlock() function shall apply a write lock like
       the pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function, with the exception that the
       function shall fail if any thread currently holds rwlock (for reading
       or writing).
       The pthread_rwlock_wrlock() function shall apply a write lock to the
       read-write lock referenced by rwlock.  The calling thread acquires
       the write lock if no other thread (reader or writer) holds the read-
       write lock rwlock.  Otherwise, the thread shall block until it can
       acquire the lock. The calling thread may deadlock if at the time the
       call is made it holds the read-write lock (whether a read or write
       lock).
       Implementations may favor writers over readers to avoid writer
       starvation.
       Results are undefined if any of these functions are called with an
       uninitialized read-write lock.
       If a signal is delivered to a thread waiting for a read-write lock
       for writing, upon return from the signal handler the thread resumes
       waiting for the read-write lock for writing as if it was not
       interrupted.
