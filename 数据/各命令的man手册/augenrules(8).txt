       augenrules is a script that merges all component audit rules files,
       found in the audit rules directory, /etc/audit/rules.d, placing the
       merged file in /etc/audit/audit.rules. Component audit rule files,
       must end in .rules in order to be processed. All other files in
       /etc/audit/rules.d are ignored.
       The files are concatenated in order, based on their natural sort (see
       -v option of ls(1)) and stripped of empty and comment (#) lines.
       The last processed -D directive without an option, if present, is
       always emitted as the first line in the resultant file. Those with an
       option are replicated in place.  The last processed -b directive, if
       present, is always emitted as the second line in the resultant file.
       The last processed -f directive, if present, is always emitted as the
       third line in the resultant file.  The last processed -e directive,
       if present, is always emitted as the last line in the resultant file.
       The generated file is only copied to /etc/audit/audit.rules, if it
       differs.
