       capng_have_capabilities will check the selected internal capabilities
       sets to see what the status is. The capabilities sets must be
       previously setup with calls to capng_get_caps_process,
       capng_get_caps_fd, or in some other way setup. The options are
       CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS for the traditional capabilities,
       CAPNG_SELECT_BOUNDS for the bounding set, or CAPNG_SELECT_BOTH if
       clearing both is desired.
