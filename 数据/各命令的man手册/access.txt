       The /etc/security/access.conf file specifies (user/group, host),
       (user/group, network/netmask), (user/group, tty), (user/group,
       X-$DISPLAY-value), or (user/group, pam-service-name) combinations for
       which a login will be either accepted or refused.
       When someone logs in, the file access.conf is scanned for the first
       entry that matches the (user/group, host) or (user/group,
       network/netmask) combination, or, in case of non-networked logins,
       the first entry that matches the (user/group, tty) combination, or in
       the case of non-networked logins without a tty, the first entry that
       matches the (user/group, X-$DISPLAY-value) or (user/group,
       pam-service-name/) combination. The permissions field of that table
       entry determines whether the login will be accepted or refused.
       Each line of the login access control table has three fields
       separated by a ":" character (colon):
       permission:users/groups:origins
       The first field, the permission field, can be either a "+" character
       (plus) for access granted or a "-" character (minus) for access
       denied.
       The second field, the users/group field, should be a list of one or
       more login names, group names, or ALL (which always matches). To
       differentiate user entries from group entries, group entries should
       be written with brackets, e.g.  (group).
       The third field, the origins field, should be a list of one or more
       tty names (for non-networked logins), X $DISPLAY values or PAM
       service names (for non-networked logins without a tty), host names,
       domain names (begin with "."), host addresses, internet network
       numbers (end with "."), internet network addresses with network mask
       (where network mask can be a decimal number or an internet address
       also), ALL (which always matches) or LOCAL. The LOCAL keyword matches
       if and only if pam_get_item(3), when called with an item_type of
       PAM_RHOST, returns NULL or an empty string (and therefore the origins
       field is compared against the return value of pam_get_item(3) called
       with an item_type of PAM_TTY or, absent that, PAM_SERVICE).
       If supported by the system you can use @netgroupname in host or user
       patterns. The @@netgroupname syntax is supported in the user pattern
       only and it makes the local system hostname to be passed to the
       netgroup match call in addition to the user name. This might not work
       correctly on some libc implementations causing the match to always
       fail.
       The EXCEPT operator makes it possible to write very compact rules.
       If the nodefgroup is not set, the group file is searched when a name
       does not match that of the logged-in user. Only groups are matched in
       which users are explicitly listed. However the PAM module does not
       look at the primary group id of a user.
       The "#" character at start of line (no space at front) can be used to
       mark this line as a comment line.
