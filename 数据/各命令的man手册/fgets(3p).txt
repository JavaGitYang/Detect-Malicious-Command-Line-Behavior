       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fgets() function shall read bytes from stream into the array
       pointed to by s, until n−1 bytes are read, or a <newline> is read and
       transferred to s, or an end-of-file condition is encountered. The
       string is then terminated with a null byte.
       The fgets() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), fscanf(), getc(), getchar(),
       getdelim(), getline(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that returns
       data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().
