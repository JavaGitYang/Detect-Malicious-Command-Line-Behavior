       The file /etc/host.conf contains configuration information specific
       to the resolver library.  It should contain one configuration keyword
       per line, followed by appropriate configuration information.  The
       following keywords are recognized:
       trim   This keyword may be listed more than once.  Each time it
              should be followed by a list of domains, separated by colons
              (':'), semicolons (';') or commas (','), with the leading dot.
              When set, the resolver library will automatically trim the
              given domain name from the end of any hostname resolved via
              DNS.  This is intended for use with local hosts and domains.
              (Related note: trim will not affect hostnames gathered via NIS
              or the hosts(5) file.  Care should be taken to ensure that the
              first hostname for each entry in the hosts file is fully
              qualified or unqualified, as appropriate for the local
              installation.)
       multi  Valid values are on and off.  If set to on, the resolver
              library will return all valid addresses for a host that
              appears in the /etc/hosts file, instead of only the first.
              This is off by default, as it may cause a substantial
              performance loss at sites with large hosts files.
       reorder
              Valid values are on and off.  If set to on, the resolver
              library will attempt to reorder host addresses so that local
              addresses (i.e., on the same subnet) are listed first when a
              gethostbyname(3) is performed.  Reordering is done for all
              lookup methods.  The default value is off.
