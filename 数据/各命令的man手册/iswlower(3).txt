       The iswlower() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       islower(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "lower".
       The wide-character class "lower" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-
       character class "print".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
       character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
       character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "punct".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-
       character class "lower" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "digit".
       The wide-character class "lower" contains at least those characters
       wc which are equal to towlower(wc) and different from towupper(wc).
       The wide-character class "lower" always contains at least the letters
       'a' to 'z'.
