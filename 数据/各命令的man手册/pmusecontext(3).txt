       An application using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent contexts, each
       associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some
       host, or an archive log of performance metrics as created by
       pmlogger(1).
       Calling pmUseContext causes the current PMAPI context to be set to
       the context identified by handle.  The value of handle must be one
       returned from an earlier call to pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3).
       Below the PMAPI, all contexts used by an application are saved in
       their most recently modified state, so pmUseContext restores the
       context to the state it was in the last time the context was used,
       not the state of the context when it was established.
