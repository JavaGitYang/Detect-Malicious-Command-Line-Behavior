       systemd is a system and service manager for Linux operating systems.
       When run as first process on boot (as PID 1), it acts as init system
       that brings up and maintains userspace services.
       For compatibility with SysV, if systemd is called as init and a PID
       that is not 1, it will execute telinit and pass all command line
       arguments unmodified. That means init and telinit are mostly
       equivalent when invoked from normal login sessions. See telinit(8)
       for more information.
       When run as a system instance, systemd interprets the configuration
       file system.conf and the files in system.conf.d directories; when run
       as a user instance, systemd interprets the configuration file
       user.conf and the files in user.conf.d directories. See
       systemd-system.conf(5) for more information.
