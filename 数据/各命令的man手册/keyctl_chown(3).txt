       keyctl_chown() changes the user and group ownership details of a key.
       A setting of -1 on either uid or gid will cause that setting to be
       ignored.
       A process that does not have the SysAdmin capability may not change a
       key's UID or set the key's GID to a value that does not match the
       process's GID or one of its group list.
       The caller must have setattr permission on a key to be able change
       its ownership.
