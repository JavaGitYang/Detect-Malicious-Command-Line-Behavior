       The truncate() function shall cause the regular file named by path to
       have a size which shall be equal to length bytes.
       If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is
       discarded. If the file was previously shorter than length, its size
       is increased, and the extended area appears as if it were zero-
       filled.
       The application shall ensure that the process has write permission
       for the file.
       If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file size
       limit for the process, the request shall fail and the implementation
       shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.
       The truncate() function shall not modify the file offset for any open
       file descriptions associated with the file. Upon successful
       completion, if the file size is changed, truncate() shall mark for
       update the last data modification and last file status change
       timestamps of the file, and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file
       mode may be cleared.
