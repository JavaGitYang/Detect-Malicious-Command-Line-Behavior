       The bsearch() function searches an array of nmemb objects, the
       initial member of which is pointed to by base, for a member that
       matches the object pointed to by key.  The size of each member of the
       array is specified by size.
       The contents of the array should be in ascending sorted order
       according to the comparison function referenced by compar.  The
       compar routine is expected to have two arguments which point to the
       key object and to an array member, in that order, and should return
       an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if the key
       object is found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be
       greater than the array member.
