       Given one or more existing commits, revert the changes that the
       related patches introduce, and record some new commits that record
       them. This requires your working tree to be clean (no modifications
       from the HEAD commit).
       Note: git revert is used to record some new commits to reverse the
       effect of some earlier commits (often only a faulty one). If you want
       to throw away all uncommitted changes in your working directory, you
       should see git-reset(1), particularly the --hard option. If you want
       to extract specific files as they were in another commit, you should
       see git-checkout(1), specifically the git checkout <commit> --
       <filename> syntax. Take care with these alternatives as both will
       discard uncommitted changes in your working directory.
