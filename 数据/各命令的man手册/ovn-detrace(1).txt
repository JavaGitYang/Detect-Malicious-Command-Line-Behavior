       The ovn-detrace program reads ovs-appctl ofproto/trace output on
       stdin, looking for flow cookies, and expand each cookie with
       corresponding OVN logical flows. It expands logical flow further with
       the north-bound information e.g. the ACL that generated the logical
       flow, when relevant.
