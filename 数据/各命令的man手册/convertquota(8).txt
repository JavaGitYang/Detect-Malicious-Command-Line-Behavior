       convertquota converts old quota files quota.user and quota.group to
       files aquota.user and aquota.group in new format currently used by
       2.4.0-ac? and newer or by SuSE or Red Hat Linux 2.4 kernels on
       filesystem.
       New file format allows using quotas for 32-bit uids / gids, setting
       quotas for root, accounting used space in bytes (and so allowing use
       of quotas in ReiserFS) and it is also architecture independent. This
       format introduces Radix Tree (a simple form of tree structure) to
       quota file.
