       pmlogextract reads one or more Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive
       logs identified by input and creates a temporally merged and/or
       reduced PCP archive log in output.  input is a comma-separated list
       of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or the
       name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The nature of
       merging is controlled by the number of input archive logs, while the
       nature of data reduction is controlled by the command line arguments.
       The input(s) must be sets of PCP archive logs created by pmlogger(1)
       with performance data collected from the same host, but usually over
       different time periods and possibly (although not usually) with
       different performance metrics being logged.
       If only one input is specified, then the default behavior simply
       copies the input set of PCP archive logs, into the output PCP archive
       log.  When two or more sets of PCP archive logs are specified as
       input, the sets of logs are merged (or concatenated) and written to
       output.
       In the output archive log a <mark> record may be inserted at a time
       just past the end of each of the input archive logs to indicate a
       possible temporal discontinuity between the end of one input archive
       log and the start of the next input archive log.  See the MARK
       RECORDS section below for more information.  There is no <mark>
       record after the end of the last (in temporal order) of the input
       archive logs.
