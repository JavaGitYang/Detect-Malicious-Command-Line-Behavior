       The column utility formats its input into multiple columns.  The util
       support three modes:
       columns are filled before rows
              This is the default mode (required by backward compatibility).
       rows are filled before columns
              This mode is enabled by option -x, --fillrows
       table  Determine the number of columns the input contains and create
              a table.  This mode is enabled by option -t, --table and
              columns formatting is possible to modify by --table-* options.
              Use this mode if not sure.
       Input is taken from file, or otherwise from standard input.  Empty
       lines are ignored and all invalid multibyte sequences are encoded by
       \x<hex> convention.
