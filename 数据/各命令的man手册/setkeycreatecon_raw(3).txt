       getkeycreatecon() retrieves the context used for creating a new
       kernel keyring.  This returned context should be freed with
       freecon(3) if non-NULL.  getkeycreatecon() sets *con to NULL if no
       keycreate context has been explicitly set by the program (i.e. using
       the default policy behavior).
       setkeycreatecon() sets the context used for creating a new kernel
       keyring.  NULL can be passed to setkeycreatecon() to reset to the
       default policy behavior.  The keycreate context is automatically
       reset after the next execve(2), so a program doesn't need to
       explicitly sanitize it upon startup.
       setkeycreatecon() can be applied prior to library functions that
       internally perform an file creation, in order to set an file context
       on the objects.
       getkeycreatecon_raw() and setkeycreatecon_raw() behave identically to
       their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.
       Note: Signal handlers that perform a setkeycreatecon() must take care
       to save, reset, and restore the keycreate context to avoid unexpected
       behavior.
       Note: Contexts are thread specific.
