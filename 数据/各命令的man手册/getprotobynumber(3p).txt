       These functions shall retrieve information about protocols. This
       information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
       accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this
       database is unspecified.
       The setprotoent() function shall open a connection to the database,
       and set the next entry to the first entry. If the stayopen argument
       is non-zero, the connection to the network protocol database shall
       not be closed after each call to getprotoent() (either directly, or
       indirectly through one of the other getproto*() functions), and the
       implementation may maintain an open file descriptor for the database.
       The getprotobyname() function shall search the database from the
       beginning and find the first entry for which the protocol name
       specified by name matches the p_name member, opening and closing a
       connection to the database as necessary.
       The getprotobynumber() function shall search the database from the
       beginning and find the first entry for which the protocol number
       specified by proto matches the p_proto member, opening and closing a
       connection to the database as necessary.
       The getprotoent() function shall read the next entry of the database,
       opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
       The getprotobyname(), getprotobynumber(), and getprotoent() functions
       shall each return a pointer to a protoent structure, the members of
       which shall contain the fields of an entry in the network protocol
       database.
       The endprotoent() function shall close the connection to the
       database, releasing any open file descriptor.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
