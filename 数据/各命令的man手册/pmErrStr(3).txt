       Translate an error code into a text string, suitable for generating a
       diagnostic message.  The pmErrStr_r function does the same, but
       stores the result in a user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen,
       which should have room for at least PM_MAXERRMSGLEN bytes.
       By convention, all error codes are negative.  The small values are
       assumed to be negated versions of the Unix error codes as defined in
       <errno.h> and the strings returned are as per strerror(3).  The
       larger, negative error codes are Performance Metrics Application
       Programming Interface (PMAPI) error conditions and pmErrStr(3)
       returns an appropriate PMAPI error string, as determined by code.
