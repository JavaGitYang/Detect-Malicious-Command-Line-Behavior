       idle() is an internal system call used during bootstrap.  It marks
       the process's pages as swappable, lowers its priority, and enters the
       main scheduling loop.  idle() never returns.
       Only process 0 may call idle().  Any user process, even a process
       with superuser permission, will receive EPERM.
