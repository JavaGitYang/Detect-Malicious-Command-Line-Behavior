       The ldap_compare_ext_s() routine is used to perform an LDAP compare
       operation synchronously.  It takes dn, the DN of the entry upon which
       to perform the compare, and attr and value, the attribute description
       and value to compare to those found in the entry.  It returns a code,
       which will be LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE if the entry contains the attribute
       value and LDAP_COMPARE_FALSE if it does not.  Otherwise, an error
       code is returned that indicates the nature of the problem.  See
       ldap(3) for details.
       The ldap_compare_ext() routine is used to perform an LDAP compare
       operation asynchronously.  It takes the same parameters as
       ldap_compare_ext_s(), but provides the message id of the request it
       initiated in the integer pointed to msgidp.  The result of the
       compare can be obtained by a subsequent call to ldap_result(3).
       Both routines allow server and client controls to be specified to
       extend the compare request.
