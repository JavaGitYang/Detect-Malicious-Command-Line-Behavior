       Slapauth is used to check the behavior of the slapd in mapping
       identities for authentication and authorization purposes, as
       specified in slapd.conf(5).  It opens the slapd.conf(5) configuration
       file or the slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the
       authz-policy/olcAuthzPolicy and authz-regexp/olcAuthzRegexp
       directives, and then parses the ID list given on the command-line.
