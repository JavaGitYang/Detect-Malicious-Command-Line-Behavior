       The strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a
       duplicate of the string s.  Memory for the new string is obtained
       with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).
       The strndup() function is similar, but copies at most n bytes.  If s
       is longer than n, only n bytes are copied, and a terminating null
       byte ('\0') is added.
       strdupa() and strndupa() are similar, but use alloca(3) to allocate
       the buffer.  They are available only when using the GNU GCC suite,
       and suffer from the same limitations described in alloca(3).
