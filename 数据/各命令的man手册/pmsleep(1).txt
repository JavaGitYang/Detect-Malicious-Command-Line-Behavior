       pmpause sleeps indefinitely, until interrupted by SIGKILL.
       pmsleep sleeps for the specified interval.  The interval argument
       follows the syntax described in PCPIntro(1) for -t, and in the
       simplest form may be an unsigned integer or floating point constant
       (the implied units in this case are seconds).
