       chkhelp checks the consistency of Performance Co-Pilot help text
       files generated by newhelp(1) and used by Performance Metric Domain
       Agents (PMDAs).  The checking involves scanning the files, and
       optionally displaying selected entries.
       The files helpfile.dir and helpfile.pag are created by newhelp(1),
       and are assumed to already exist.
       Without any options or metricname arguments, chkhelp silently
       verifies the structural integrity of the help files.
       If any metricname arguments are specified, then the help entries for
       only the corresponding metrics will be processed.
       If no metricname arguments are specified, then at least one of the
       options -i or -p must be given.  The -i option causes entries for all
       instance domains to be processed (ignoring entries for performance
       metrics).  The -p option causes entries for all metrics to be
       displayed (ignoring entries for instance domains).
       When metric entries are to be processed (via either the metricname
       arguments or the -p option or the -i option), the -O and -H options
       request the display of the one-line and verbose help text
       respectively.  The default is -O.
       Although historically there have been multiple help text file
       formats, the only format currently supported using the -v option is
       version 2, and this is the default if no -v flag is provided.
       Normally chkhelp operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified an alternative
       namespace is loaded from the file pmnsfile.
       The -e option provides an existence check where all of the specified
       metrics from the PMNS (note, not from helpfile) are scanned, and only
       the names of the metrics for which no help text exists are reported.
       The -e option is mutually exclusive with the -i and/or -p options.
