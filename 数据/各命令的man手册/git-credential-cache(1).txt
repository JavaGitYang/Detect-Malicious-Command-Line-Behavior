       This command caches credentials in memory for use by future Git
       programs. The stored credentials never touch the disk, and are
       forgotten after a configurable timeout. The cache is accessible over
       a Unix domain socket, restricted to the current user by filesystem
       permissions.
       You probably donâ€™t want to invoke this command directly; it is meant
       to be used as a credential helper by other parts of Git. See
       gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.
