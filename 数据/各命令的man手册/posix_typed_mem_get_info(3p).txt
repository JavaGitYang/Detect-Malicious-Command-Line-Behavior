       The posix_typed_mem_get_info() function shall return, in the
       posix_tmi_length field of the posix_typed_mem_info structure pointed
       to by info, the maximum length which may be successfully allocated by
       the typed memory object designated by fildes.  This maximum length
       shall take into account the flag POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE or
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG specified when the typed memory
       object represented by fildes was opened. The maximum length is
       dynamic; therefore, the value returned is valid only while the
       current mapping of the corresponding typed memory pool remains
       unchanged.
       If fildes represents a typed memory object opened with neither the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE flag nor the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG
       flag specified, the returned value of info->posix_tmi_length is
       unspecified.
       The posix_typed_mem_get_info() function may return additional
       implementation-defined information in other fields of the
       posix_typed_mem_info structure pointed to by info.
       If the memory object specified by fildes is not a typed memory
       object, then the behavior of this function is undefined.
