       lpr submits files for printing.  Files named on the command line are
       sent to the named printer or the default destination if no
       destination is specified.  If no files are listed on the command-
       line, lpr reads the print file from the standard input.
   THE DEFAULT DESTINATION
       CUPS provides many ways to set the default destination. The LPDEST
       and PRINTER environment variables are consulted first.  If neither
       are set, the current default set using the lpoptions(1) command is
       used, followed by the default set using the lpadmin(8) command.
