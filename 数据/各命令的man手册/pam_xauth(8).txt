       The pam_xauth PAM module is designed to forward xauth keys (sometimes
       referred to as "cookies") between users.
       Without pam_xauth, when xauth is enabled and a user uses the su(1)
       command to assume another user's privileges, that user is no longer
       able to access the original user's X display because the new user
       does not have the key needed to access the display. pam_xauth solves
       the problem by forwarding the key from the user running su (the
       source user) to the user whose identity the source user is assuming
       (the target user) when the session is created, and destroying the key
       when the session is torn down.
       This means, for example, that when you run su(1) from an xterm
       session, you will be able to run X programs without explicitly
       dealing with the xauth(1) xauth command or ~/.Xauthority files.
       pam_xauth will only forward keys if xauth can list a key connected to
       the $DISPLAY environment variable.
       Primitive access control is provided by ~/.xauth/export in the
       invoking user's home directory and ~/.xauth/import in the target
       user's home directory.
       If a user has a ~/.xauth/import file, the user will only receive
       cookies from users listed in the file. If there is no ~/.xauth/import
       file, the user will accept cookies from any other user.
       If a user has a .xauth/export file, the user will only forward
       cookies to users listed in the file. If there is no ~/.xauth/export
       file, and the invoking user is not root, the user will forward
       cookies to any other user. If there is no ~/.xauth/export file, and
       the invoking user is root, the user will not forward cookies to other
       users.
       Both the import and export files support wildcards (such as *). Both
       the import and export files can be empty, signifying that no users
       are allowed.
