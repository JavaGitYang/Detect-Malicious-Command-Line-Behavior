       A device ID consists of two parts: a major ID, identifying the class
       of the device, and a minor ID, identifying a specific instance of a
       device in that class.  A device ID is represented using the type
       dev_t.
       Given major and minor device IDs, makedev() combines these to produce
       a device ID, returned as the function result.  This device ID can be
       given to mknod(2), for example.
       The major() and minor() functions perform the converse task: given a
       device ID, they return, respectively, the major and minor components.
       These macros can be useful to, for example, decompose the device IDs
       in the structure returned by stat(2).
