       The find utility shall recursively descend the directory hierarchy
       from each file specified by path, evaluating a Boolean expression
       composed of the primaries described in the OPERANDS section for each
       file encountered. Each path operand shall be evaluated unaltered as
       it was provided, including all trailing <slash> characters; all
       pathnames for other files encountered in the hierarchy shall consist
       of the concatenation of the current path operand, a <slash> if the
       current path operand did not end in one, and the filename relative to
       the path operand. The relative portion shall contain no dot or dot-
       dot components, no trailing <slash> characters, and only single
       <slash> characters between pathname components.
       The find utility shall be able to descend to arbitrary depths in a
       file hierarchy and shall not fail due to path length limitations
       (unless a path operand specified by the application exceeds
       {PATH_MAX} requirements).
       The find utility shall detect infinite loops; that is, entering a
       previously visited directory that is an ancestor of the last file
       encountered.  When it detects an infinite loop, find shall write a
       diagnostic message to standard error and shall either recover its
       position in the hierarchy or terminate.
       If a file is removed from or added to the directory hierarchy being
       searched it is unspecified whether or not find includes that file in
       its search.
