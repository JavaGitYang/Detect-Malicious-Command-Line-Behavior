       getpeername() returns the address of the peer connected to the socket
       sockfd, in the buffer pointed to by addr.  The addrlen argument
       should be initialized to indicate the amount of space pointed to by
       addr.  On return it contains the actual size of the name returned (in
       bytes).  The name is truncated if the buffer provided is too small.
       The returned address is truncated if the buffer provided is too
       small; in this case, addrlen will return a value greater than was
       supplied to the call.
