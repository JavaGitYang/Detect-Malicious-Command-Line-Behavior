       systemd-fsck@.service and systemd-fsck-root.service are services
       responsible for file system checks. They are instantiated for each
       device that is configured for file system checking.
       systemd-fsck-root.service is responsible for file system checks on
       the root file system, but only if the root filesystem was not checked
       in the initramfs.  systemd-fsck@.service is used for all other file
       systems and for the root file system in the initramfs.
       These services are started at boot if passno in /etc/fstab for the
       file system is set to a value greater than zero. The file system
       check for root is performed before the other file systems. Other file
       systems may be checked in parallel, except when they are on the same
       rotating disk.
       systemd-fsck does not know any details about specific filesystems,
       and simply executes file system checkers specific to each filesystem
       type (/sbin/fsck.*). This helper will decide if the filesystem should
       actually be checked based on the time since last check, number of
       mounts, unclean unmount, etc.
       If a file system check fails for a service without nofail, emergency
       mode is activated, by isolating to emergency.target.
