       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants as possible values of the which argument of getpriority()
       and setpriority():
       PRIO_PROCESS    Identifies the who argument as a process ID.
       PRIO_PGRP       Identifies the who argument as a process group ID.
       PRIO_USER       Identifies the who argument as a user ID.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the following type through
       typedef:
       rlim_t          Unsigned integer type used for limit values.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants, which shall have values suitable for use in #if
       preprocessing directives:
       RLIM_INFINITY   A value of rlim_t indicating no limit.
       RLIM_SAVED_MAX  A value of type rlim_t indicating an unrepresentable
                       saved hard limit.
       RLIM_SAVED_CUR  A value of type rlim_t indicating an unrepresentable
                       saved soft limit.
       On implementations where all resource limits are representable in an
       object of type rlim_t, RLIM_SAVED_MAX and RLIM_SAVED_CUR need not be
       distinct from RLIM_INFINITY.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants as possible values of the who parameter of getrusage():
       RUSAGE_SELF     Returns information about the current process.
       RUSAGE_CHILDREN Returns information about children of the current
                       process.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the rlimit structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:
           rlim_t rlim_cur  The current (soft) limit.
           rlim_t rlim_max  The hard limit.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the rusage structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:
           struct timeval ru_utime  User time used.
           struct timeval ru_stime  System time used.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the timeval structure as
       described in <sys/time.h>.
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the following symbolic
       constants as possible values for the resource argument of getrlimit()
       and setrlimit():
       RLIMIT_CORE     Limit on size of core file.
       RLIMIT_CPU      Limit on CPU time per process.
       RLIMIT_DATA     Limit on data segment size.
       RLIMIT_FSIZE    Limit on file size.
       RLIMIT_NOFILE   Limit on number of open files.
       RLIMIT_STACK    Limit on stack size.
       RLIMIT_AS       Limit on address space size.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int  getpriority(int, id_t);
           int  getrlimit(int, struct rlimit *);
           int  getrusage(int, struct rusage *);
           int  setpriority(int, id_t, int);
           int  setrlimit(int, const struct rlimit *);
       The <sys/resource.h> header shall define the id_t type through
       typedef, as described in <sys/types.h>.
       Inclusion of the <sys/resource.h> header may also make visible all
       symbols from <sys/time.h>.
       The following sections are informative.
