       lxc-attach runs the specified command inside the container specified
       by name. The container has to be running already.
       If no command is specified, the current default shell of the user
       running lxc-attach will be looked up inside the container and
       executed. This will fail if no such user exists inside the container
       or the container does not have a working nsswitch mechanism.
       Previous versions of lxc-attach simply attached to the specified
       namespaces of a container and ran a shell or the specified command
       without first allocating a pseudo terminal. This made them vulnerable
       to input faking via a TIOCSTI ioctl call after switching between
       userspace execution contexts with different privilege levels. Newer
       versions of lxc-attach will try to allocate a pseudo terminal
       master/slave pair on the host and attach any standard file
       descriptors which refer to a terminal to the slave side of the pseudo
       terminal before executing a shell or command. Note, that if none of
       the standard file descriptors refer to a terminal lxc-attach will not
       try to allocate a pseudo terminal. Instead it will simply attach to
       the containers namespaces and run a shell or the specified command.
