       The posix_madvise() function shall advise the implementation on the
       expected behavior of the application with respect to the data in the
       memory starting at address addr, and continuing for len bytes. The
       implementation may use this information to optimize handling of the
       specified data. The posix_madvise() function shall have no effect on
       the semantics of access to memory in the specified range, although it
       may affect the performance of access.
       The implementation may require that addr be a multiple of the page
       size, which is the value returned by sysconf() when the name value
       _SC_PAGESIZE is used.
       The advice to be applied to the memory range is specified by the
       advice parameter and may be one of the following values:
       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its
             behavior with respect to the specified range. It is the default
             characteristic if no advice is given for a range of memory.
       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             range sequentially from lower addresses to higher addresses.
       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             range in a random order.
       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             range in the near future.
       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies that the application expects that it will not access
             the specified range in the near future.
       These values are defined in the <sys/mman.h> header.
