       The actions object in tc allows a user to define actions
       independently of a classifier (filter). These actions can then be
       assigned to one or more filters, with any packets matching the
       classifier's criteria having that action performed on them.
       Each action type (mirred, police, etc.) will have its own table to
       store all created actions.
