       The pam_open_session function sets up a user session for a previously
       successful authenticated user. The session should later be terminated
       with a call to pam_close_session(3).
       It should be noted that the effective uid, geteuid(2). of the
       application should be of sufficient privilege to perform such tasks
       as creating or mounting the user's home directory for example.
       The flags argument is the binary or of zero or more of the following
       values:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
