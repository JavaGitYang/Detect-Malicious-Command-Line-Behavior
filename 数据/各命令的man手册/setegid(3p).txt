       If gid is equal to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID, or if
       the process has appropriate privileges, setegid() shall set the
       effective group ID of the calling process to gid; the real group ID,
       saved set-group-ID, and any supplementary group IDs shall remain
       unchanged.
       The setegid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list
       in any way.
