       pmdaInstance uses the standard PMDA(3) data structures to return
       information concerning the instance domain indom.
       The result structure is constructed by pmdaInstance and will contain
       one or more instance names and/or identifiers as specified by the
       inst and name arguments.
       If inst has the value PM_IN_NULL and name is a null string, result
       will contain all the instances names and identifiers in the instance
       domain.
       If inst is PM_IN_NULL but name is the name of an instance in the
       instance domain indom, then result will contain the instance
       identifier for instance name.  Note that if name contains no spaces,
       partial matching up to the first space in the instance name is
       performed, i.e.  ``1'' will match instance name ``1 minute''.  If
       name contains an embedded space, then no partial matching is
       performed and name should match one of the instance names exactly.
       If name is a null string but inst is an instance identifier in the
       instance domain indom, then result will contain the name for instance
       inst.  The result structure is allocated with malloc(3) and should be
       released by the caller with free(3).
