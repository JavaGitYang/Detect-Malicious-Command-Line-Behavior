       The library supports the Intel Haswell C-Box (coherency engine)
       uncore PMU.  This PMU model only exists on Haswell model 63. There is
       one C-box PMU per physical core. Therefore there are up to eighteen
       identical C-Box PMU instances numbered from 0 to 17. On dual-socket
       systems, the number refers to the C-Box PMU on the socket where the
       program runs. For instance, if running on CPU18, then hswep_unc_cbo0
       refers to the C-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if
       running on CPU0, then the same hswep_unc_cbo0 refers to the C-Box for
       physical core 0 but on socket 0.
       Each C-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter registers
       used only with certain events and umasks.
