       This function will return certificate's value of SkipCerts, by
       reading the DER data of the Inhibit anyPolicy X.509 extension
       (2.5.29.54).
       The  skipcerts value is the number of additional certificates that
       may appear in the path before the anyPolicy
       (GNUTLS_X509_OID_POLICY_ANY) is no longer acceptable.
