       Sparse parses C source and looks for errors, producing warnings on
       standard error.
       Sparse accepts options controlling the set of warnings to generate.
       To turn on warnings Sparse does not issue by default, use the
       corresponding warning option -Wsomething.  Sparse issues some
       warnings by default; to turn off those warnings, pass the negation of
       the associated warning option, -Wno-something.
