       These functions read from the file /etc/fstab.  The struct fstab is
       defined by:
           struct fstab {
               char       *fs_spec;       /* block device name */
               char       *fs_file;       /* mount point */
               char       *fs_vfstype;    /* file-system type */
               char       *fs_mntops;     /* mount options */
               const char *fs_type;       /* rw/rq/ro/sw/xx option */
               int         fs_freq;       /* dump frequency, in days */
               int         fs_passno;     /* pass number on parallel dump */
           };
       Here the field fs_type contains (on a *BSD system) one of the five
       strings "rw", "rq", "ro", "sw", "xx" (read-write, read-write with
       quota, read-only, swap, ignore).
       The function setfsent() opens the file when required and positions it
       at the first line.
       The function getfsent() parses the next line from the file.  (After
       opening it when required.)
       The function endfsent() closes the file when required.
       The function getfsspec() searches the file from the start and returns
       the first entry found for which the fs_spec field matches the spe‚Äê
       cial_file argument.
       The function getfsfile() searches the file from the start and returns
       the first entry found for which the fs_file field matches the
       mount_point argument.
