       The uniq utility shall read an input file comparing adjacent lines,
       and write one copy of each input line on the output. The second and
       succeeding copies of repeated adjacent input lines shall not be
       written.  The trailing <newline> of each line in the input shall be
       ignored when doing comparisons.
       Repeated lines in the input shall not be detected if they are not
       adjacent.
