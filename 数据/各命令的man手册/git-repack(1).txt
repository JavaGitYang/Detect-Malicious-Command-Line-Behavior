       This command is used to combine all objects that do not currently
       reside in a "pack", into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize
       existing packs into a single, more efficient pack.
       A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
       delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
       associated index file.
       Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
       disk storage, etc.
