       Substitutes the values of environment variables.
   Operation mode:
       -v, --variables
              output the variables occurring in SHELL-FORMAT
   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit
       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
       In normal operation mode, standard input is copied to standard
       output, with references to environment variables of the form
       $VARIABLE or ${VARIABLE} being replaced with the corresponding
       values.  If a SHELL-FORMAT is given, only those environment variables
       that are referenced in SHELL-FORMAT are substituted; otherwise all
       environment variables references occurring in standard input are
       substituted.
       When --variables is used, standard input is ignored, and the output
       consists of the environment variables that are referenced in SHELL-
       FORMAT, one per line.
