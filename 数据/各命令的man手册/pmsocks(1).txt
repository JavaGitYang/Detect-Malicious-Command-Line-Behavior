       pmsocks allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on hosts
       located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to monitor remote
       hosts on the other side of the firewall.  This assumes the firewall
       has been configured with a compliant sockd daemon and the necessary
       access controls are satisfied.
