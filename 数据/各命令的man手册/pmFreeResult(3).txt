       The variable sized results returned by pmFetch(3) are allocated below
       the Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
       using a combination of dynamic (i.e. malloc(3)) and specialized
       allocation strategies.
       Applications should call pmFreeResult to release the storage
       previously allocated for result by pmFetch(3), when the application
       no longer requires access to the pmResult structure.
       Under no circumstances should an application use free(result) to
       release storage previously allocated for a pmResult by pmFetch(3).
