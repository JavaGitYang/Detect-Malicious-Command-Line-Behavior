       selabel_lookup_best_match() performs a best match lookup operation on
       the handle hnd, returning the result in the memory pointed to by
       context, which must be freed by the caller using freecon(3).  The key
       parameter is a file path to check for best match using zero or more
       link (aliases) parameters. The order of precedence for best match is:
              1.  An exact match for the real path (key) or
              2.  An exact match for any of the links (aliases), or
              3.  The longest fixed prefix match.
       The type parameter is an optional file mode argument that should be
       set to the mode bits of the file, as determined by lstat(2).  mode
       may be zero, however full matching may not occur.
       selabel_lookup_best_match_raw() behaves identically to
       selabel_lookup_best_match() but does not perform context translation.
