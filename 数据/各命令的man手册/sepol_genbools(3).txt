       sepol_genbools rewrites a binary policy stored in the memory region
       described by (data, len) to use the boolean settings specified in the
       file named by boolpath.  The boolean settings are specified by
       name=value lines where value may be 0 or false to disable or 1 or
       true to enable.  The binary policy is rewritten in place in memory.
       sepol_genbools_array does likewise, but obtains the boolean settings
       from the parallel arrays (names, values) with nel elements each.
