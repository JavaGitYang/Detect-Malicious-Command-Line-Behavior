       This function will add the given certificate revocation lists to the
       trusted list. The list of CRLs must not be deinitialized during this
       structure's lifetime.
       This function must be called after gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_cas()
       to allow verifying the CRLs for validity. If the flag
       GNUTLS_TL_NO_DUPLICATES is given, then any provided CRLs that are a
       duplicate, will be deinitialized and not added to the list (that
       assumes that gnutls_x509_trust_list_deinit() will be called with
       all=1).
       If GNUTLS_TL_VERIFY_CRL is given the CRLs will be verified before
       being added.
