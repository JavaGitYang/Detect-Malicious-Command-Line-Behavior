     The acl_get_qualifier() function retrieves the qualifier from the ACL
     entry indicated by the argument entry_d into working storage and
     returns a pointer to that storage.
     If the value of the tag type in the ACL entry referred to by entry_d is
     ACL_USER, then the value returned by acl_get_qualifier() is a pointer
     to type uid_t.  If the value of the tag type in the ACL entry referred
     to by entry_d is ACL_GROUP, then the value returned by
     acl_get_qualifier() is a pointer to type gid_t.  If the tag type in the
     ACL entry referred to by entry_d is a tag type for which a qualifier is
     not supported, acl_get_qualifier() returns a value of (void *)NULL and
     the function fails. Subsequent operations using the returned pointer
     operate on an independent copy of the qualifier in working storage, and
     will not change the qualifier of the ACL entry.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated. The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new qualifier is no longer required, by
     calling acl_free() with the void * value returned by
     acl_get_qualifier() as an argument.
     The argument entry_d and any other ACL entry descriptors that refer to
     entries within the ACL containing the entry referred to by entry_d con‚Äê
     tinue to refer to those entries. The order of all existing entries in
     the ACL containing the entry referred to by entry_d remains unchanged.
