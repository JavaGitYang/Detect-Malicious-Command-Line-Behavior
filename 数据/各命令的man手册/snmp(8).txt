       The CUPS SNMP backend provides legacy discovery and identification of
       network printers using SNMPv1.  When used for discovery through the
       scheduler, the backend will list all printers that respond to a
       broadcast SNMPv1 query with the "public" community name.  Additional
       queries are then sent to printers that respond in order to determine
       the correct device URI, make and model, and other information needed
       for printing.
       In the first form, the SNMP backend is run directly by the user to
       look up the device URI and other information when you have an IP
       address or hostname.  This can be used for programs that need to
       configure print queues where the user has supplied an address but
       nothing else.
       In the second form, the SNMP backend is run indirectly using the
       lpinfo(8) command.  The output provides all printers detected via
       SNMP on the configured broadcast addresses.  Note: no broadcast
       addresses are configured by default.
