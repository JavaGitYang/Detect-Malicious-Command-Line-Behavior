       The nice() function shall add the value of incr to the nice value of
       the calling process. A nice value of a process is a non-negative
       number for which a more positive value shall result in less favorable
       scheduling.
       A maximum nice value of 2*{NZERO}−1 and a minimum nice value of 0
       shall be imposed by the system. Requests for values above or below
       these limits shall result in the nice value being set to the
       corresponding limit. Only a process with appropriate privileges can
       lower the nice value.
       Calling the nice() function has no effect on the priority of
       processes or threads with policy SCHED_FIFO or SCHED_RR.  The effect
       on processes or threads with other scheduling policies is
       implementation-defined.
       The nice value set with nice() shall be applied to the process. If
       the process is multi-threaded, the nice value shall affect all system
       scope threads in the process.
       As −1 is a permissible return value in a successful situation, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call nice(), and if it returns −1, check to see whether errno
       is non-zero.
