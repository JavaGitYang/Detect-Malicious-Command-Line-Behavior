       The aio_write() function queues the I/O request described by the
       buffer pointed to by aiocbp.  This function is the asynchronous
       analog of write(2).  The arguments of the call
           write(fd, buf, count)
       correspond (in order) to the fields aio_fildes, aio_buf, and
       aio_nbytes of the structure pointed to by aiocbp.  (See aio(7) for a
       description of the aiocb structure.)
       If O_APPEND is not set, the data is written starting at the absolute
       position aiocbp->aio_offset, regardless of the file offset.  If
       O_APPEND is set, data is written at the end of the file in the same
       order as aio_write() calls are made.  After the call, the value of
       the file offset is unspecified.
       The "asynchronous" means that this call returns as soon as the
       request has been enqueued; the write may or may not have completed
       when the call returns.  One tests for completion using aio_error(3).
       The return status of a completed I/O operation can be obtained
       aio_return(3).  Asynchronous notification of I/O completion can be
       obtained by setting aiocbp->aio_sigevent appropriately; see
       sigevent(7) for details.
       If _POSIX_PRIORITIZED_IO is defined, and this file supports it, then
       the asynchronous operation is submitted at a priority equal to that
       of the calling process minus aiocbp->aio_reqprio.
       The field aiocbp->aio_lio_opcode is ignored.
       No data is written to a regular file beyond its maximum offset.
