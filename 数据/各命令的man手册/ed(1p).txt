       The ed utility is a line-oriented text editor that uses two modes:
       command mode and input mode.  In command mode the input characters
       shall be interpreted as commands, and in input mode they shall be
       interpreted as text. See the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.
       If an operand is 'âˆ’', the results are unspecified.
