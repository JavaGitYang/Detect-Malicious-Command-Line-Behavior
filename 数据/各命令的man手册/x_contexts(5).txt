       The X contexts backend maps from X Window System object names into
       security contexts. It is used to find the appropriate context for X
       Window System objects whose significance and/or usage semantics are
       determined primarily by name. The returned context must be freed
       using freecon(3).
       selabel_lookup(3) describes the function with its return and error
       codes.
       This backend is also used to determine the default context for
       labeling remotely connected X clients.
       The object_type argument should be set to one of the following
       values:
              SELABEL_X_PROP
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a window
                     property, such as "WM_NAME".
              SELABEL_X_SELN
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     selection, such as "PRIMARY".
              SELABEL_X_EXT
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     protocol extension, such as "RENDER".
              SELABEL_X_EVENT
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of an event
                     type, such as "X11:ButtonPress".
              SELABEL_X_CLIENT
                     The object_name argument is ignored, however it should
                     be set to either * (an asterisk or 'wildcard' that will
                     select the default entry) or a specific entry such as
                     "remote" in the X contexts file as shown in the EXAMPLE
                     section. The default context for labeling remote X
                     clients is then returned.
              SELABEL_X_POLYPROP
                     Like SELABEL_X_PROP, but checks if the property was
                     marked as being polyinstantiated. See NOTES below.
              SELABEL_X_POLYSELN
                     Like SELABEL_X_SELN, but checks if the selection was
                     marked as being polyinstantiated. See NOTES below.
       Any messages generated by selabel_lookup(3) are sent to stderr by
       default, although this can be changed by selinux_set_callback(3).
       selabel_lookup_raw behaves identically to selabel_lookup but does not
       perform context translation.
       The FILES section details the configuration files used to determine
       the X object context.
