       The gencat utility shall merge the message text source file msgfile
       into a formatted message catalog catfile.  The file catfile shall be
       created if it does not already exist. If catfile does exist, its
       messages shall be included in the new catfile.  If set and message
       numbers collide, the new message text defined in msgfile shall
       replace the old message text currently contained in catfile.
