     The acl_get_entry() function obtains a descriptor for an ACL entry as
     specified by entry_id within the ACL indicated by the argument acl.  If
     the value of entry_id is ACL_FIRST_ENTRY, then the function returns in
     entry_p a descriptor for the first ACL entry within acl.  If the value
     of entry_id is ACL_NEXT_ENTRY, then the function returns in entry_p a
     descriptor for the next ACL entry within acl.
     If a call is made to acl_get_entry() with entry_id set to
     ACL_NEXT_ENTRY when there has not been either an initial successful
     call to acl_get_entry(), or a previous successful call to
     acl_get_entry() following a call to acl_calc_mask(), acl_copy_int(),
     acl_create_entry(), acl_delete_entry(), acl_dup(), acl_from_text(),
     acl_get_fd(), acl_get_file(), acl_set_fd(), acl_set_file(), or
     acl_valid(), then the effect is unspecified.
     Calls to acl_get_entry() do not modify any ACL entries. Subsequent
     operations using the returned ACL entry descriptor operate on the ACL
     entry within the ACL in working storage. The order of all existing
     entries in the ACL remains unchanged.  Any existing ACL entry descrip‚Äê
     tors that refer to entries within the ACL continue to refer to those
     entries. Any existing ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by
     acl continue to refer to the ACL.
