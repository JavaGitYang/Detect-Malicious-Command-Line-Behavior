       sd_event_exit() requests the event loop specified in the event event
       loop object to exit. The code parameter may be any integer value and
       is returned as-is by sd_event_loop(3) after the last event loop
       iteration. It may also be queried using sd_event_get_exit_code(), see
       below.
       When exiting is requested the event loop will stop listening for and
       dispatching regular event sources. Instead it will proceed with
       executing only event sources registered with sd_event_add_exit(3) in
       the order defined by their priority. After all exit event sources
       have been dispatched the event loop is terminated.
       If sd_event_exit() is invoked a second time while the event loop is
       still processing exit event sources, the exit code stored in the
       event loop object is updated, but otherwise no further operation is
       executed.
       sd_event_get_exit_code() may be used to query the exit code passed
       into sd_event_exit() earlier.
       While the full positive and negative integer ranges may be used for
       the exit code, care should be taken not pick exit codes that conflict
       with regular exit codes returned by sd_event_loop(), if these exit
       codes shall be distinguishable.
