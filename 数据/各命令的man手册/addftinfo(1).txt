       addftinfo reads a troff font file and adds some additional font-
       metric information that is used by the groff system.  The font file
       with the information added is written on the standard output.  The
       information added is guessed using some parametric information about
       the font and assumptions about the traditional troff names for
       characters.  The main information added is the heights and depths of
       characters.  The res and unitwidth arguments should be the same as
       the corresponding parameters in the DESC file; font is the name of
       the file describing the font; if font ends with I the font will be
       assumed to be italic.
