       xfs_growfs expands an existing XFS filesystem (see xfs(5)).  The
       mount-point argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted. The filesystem must be mounted to be grown
       (see mount(8)).  The existing contents of the filesystem are
       undisturbed, and the added space becomes available for additional
       file storage.
       xfs_info is equivalent to invoking xfs_growfs with the -n option (see
       discussion below).
