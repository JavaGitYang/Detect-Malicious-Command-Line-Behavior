       The function field_info returns the sizes and other attributes passed
       in to the field at its creation time.  The attributes are: height,
       width, row of upper-left corner, column of upper-left corner, number
       off-screen rows, and number of working buffers.
       The function dynamic_field_info returns the actual size of the field,
       and its maximum possible size.  If the field has no size limit, the
       location addressed by the third argument will be set to 0.  A field
       can be made dynamic by turning off the O_STATIC option with
       field_opts_off.
