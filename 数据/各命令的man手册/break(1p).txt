       The break utility shall exit from the smallest enclosing for, while,
       or until loop, if any; or from the nth enclosing loop if n is
       specified. The value of n is an unsigned decimal integer greater than
       or equal to 1. The default shall be equivalent to n=1.  If n is
       greater than the number of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing
       loop shall be exited. Execution shall continue with the command
       immediately following the loop.
