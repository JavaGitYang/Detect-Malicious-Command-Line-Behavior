       Given a process ID and one or more resources, prlimit tries to
       retrieve and/or modify the limits.
       When command is given, prlimit will run this command with the given
       arguments.
       The limits parameter is composed of a soft and a hard value,
       separated by a colon (:), in order to modify the existing values.  If
       no limits are given, prlimit will display the current values.  If one
       of the values is not given, then the existing one will be used.  To
       specify the unlimited or infinity limit (RLIM_INFINITY), the -1 or
       'unlimited' string can be passed.
       Because of the nature of limits, the soft limit must be lower or
       equal to the high limit (also called the ceiling).  To see all
       available resource limits, refer to the RESOURCE OPTIONS section.
       soft:hard    Specify both limits.
       soft:        Specify only the soft limit.
       :hard        Specify only the hard limit.
       value        Specify both limits to the same value.
