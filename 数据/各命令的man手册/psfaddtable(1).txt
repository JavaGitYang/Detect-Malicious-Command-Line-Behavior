       psfaddtable takes a console font in .psf format given by fontfile and
       merges it with the Unicode character table given by tablefile to
       produce a font file with an embedded character table, which is
       written to outfile.  An input file name of "-" denotes standard
       input, and an output file name of "-" denotes standard output.  If
       the fontfile already contains an embedded character table, it is
       ignored.
