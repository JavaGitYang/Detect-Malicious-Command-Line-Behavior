       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The ungetwc() function shall push the character corresponding to the
       wide-character code specified by wc back onto the input stream
       pointed to by stream.  The pushed-back characters shall be returned
       by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their
       pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed to by
       stream) to a file-positioning function (fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(),
       or rewind()) or fflush() shall discard any pushed-back characters for
       the stream. The external storage corresponding to the stream is
       unchanged.
       At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If ungetwc()
       is called too many times on the same stream without an intervening
       read or file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may
       fail.
       If the value of wc equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation shall
       fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.
       A successful call to ungetwc() shall clear the end-of-file indicator
       for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator for the
       stream after all pushed-back characters have been read, or discarded
       by calling fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind() (but not
       fflush()), shall be the same as it was before the characters were
       pushed back. The file-position indicator is decremented (by one or
       more) by each successful call to ungetwc(); if its value was 0 before
       a call, its value is unspecified after the call.
