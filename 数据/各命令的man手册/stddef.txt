       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The <stddef.h> header shall define the following macros:
       NULL      Null pointer constant.  The macro shall expand to an
                 integer constant expression with the value 0 cast to type
                 void *.
       offsetof(type, member-designator)
                 Integer constant expression of type size_t, the value of
                 which is the offset in bytes to the structure member
                 (member-designator), from the beginning of its structure
                 (type).
       The <stddef.h> header shall define the following types:
       ptrdiff_t Signed integer type of the result of subtracting two
                 pointers.
       wchar_t   Integer type whose range of values can represent distinct
                 codes for all members of the largest extended character set
                 specified among the supported locales; the null character
                 shall have the code value zero. Each member of the basic
                 character set shall have a code value equal to its value
                 when used as the lone character in an integer character
                 constant if an implementation does not define
                 __STDC_MB_MIGHT_NEQ_WC__.
       size_t    Unsigned integer type of the result of the sizeof operator.
       The implementation shall support one or more programming environments
       in which the widths of ptrdiff_t, size_t, and wchar_t are no greater
       than the width of type long.  The names of these programming
       environments can be obtained using the confstr() function or the
       getconf utility.
