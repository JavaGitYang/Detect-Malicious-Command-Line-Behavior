       Behavior:
              The query function will fail if a matching key is not found.
              Otherwise, the corresponding object is returned.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The key identifies the object
              being queried, which will be stored in the address pointed by
              response The key is a property of the caller, and will not be
              stored or modified internally. The object returned becomes a
              property of the caller, and must be freed with
              semanage_OBJECT_free.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) )
