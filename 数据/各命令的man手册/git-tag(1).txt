       Add a tag reference in refs/tags/, unless -d/-l/-v is given to
       delete, list or verify tags.
       Unless -f is given, the named tag must not yet exist.
       If one of -a, -s, or -u <keyid> is passed, the command creates a tag
       object, and requires a tag message. Unless -m <msg> or -F <file> is
       given, an editor is started for the user to type in the tag message.
       If -m <msg> or -F <file> is given and -a, -s, and -u <keyid> are
       absent, -a is implied.
       Otherwise just a tag reference for the SHA-1 object name of the
       commit object is created (i.e. a lightweight tag).
       A GnuPG signed tag object will be created when -s or -u <keyid> is
       used. When -u <keyid> is not used, the committer identity for the
       current user is used to find the GnuPG key for signing. The
       configuration variable gpg.program is used to specify custom GnuPG
       binary.
       Tag objects (created with -a, -s, or -u) are called "annotated" tags;
       they contain a creation date, the tagger name and e-mail, a tagging
       message, and an optional GnuPG signature. Whereas a "lightweight" tag
       is simply a name for an object (usually a commit object).
       Annotated tags are meant for release while lightweight tags are meant
       for private or temporary object labels. For this reason, some git
       commands for naming objects (like git describe) will ignore
       lightweight tags by default.
