       pmdasimple is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports a small number of synthetic performance metrics.
       The simple PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be an
       aid for PMDA developers.  In terms of code size and features, it is
       more complex than the trivial PMDA, about the same as the txmon PMDA
       and less complex than the sample PMDA.  The source for the simple
       PMDA is a good template from which production, customized PMDAs can
       be developed.
       A brief description of the pmdasimple command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -i   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the specified TCP/IP
            port.  port may be a port number or port name.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            simple.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdasimple is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
            standard error instead.
       -p   Expect PMCD to create a pipe and the connection to pmdasimple is
            via standard input and standard output.  This is the default
            connection mode.
       -u   Expect PMCD to connect to pmdasimple on the Unix domain socket
            named socket.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
       At most one of the options -i, -p and -u may be specified.
