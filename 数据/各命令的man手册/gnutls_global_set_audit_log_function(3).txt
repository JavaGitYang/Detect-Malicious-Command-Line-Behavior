       This is the function to set the audit logging function. This is a
       function to report important issues, such as possible attacks in the
       protocol. This is different from gnutls_global_set_log_function()
       because it will report also session-specific events. The session
       parameter will be null if there is no corresponding TLS session.
        gnutls_audit_log_func is of the form, void (*gnutls_audit_log_func)(
       gnutls_session_t, const char*);
