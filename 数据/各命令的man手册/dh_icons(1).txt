       dh_icons is a debhelper program that updates caches of Freedesktop
       icons when needed, using the update-icon-caches program provided by
       GTK+2.12.  Currently this program does not handle installation of the
       files, though it may do so at a later date, so should be run after
       icons are installed in the package build directories.
       It takes care of adding maintainer script fragments to call update-
       icon-caches for icon directories. (This is not done for gnome and
       hicolor icons, as those are handled by triggers.)  These commands are
       inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).
