       uptime gives a one line display of the following information.  The
       current time, how long the system has been running, how many users
       are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1,
       5, and 15 minutes.
       This is the same information contained in the header line displayed
       by w(1).
       System load averages is the average number of processes that are
       either in a runnable or uninterruptable state.  A process in a
       runnable state is either using the CPU or waiting to use the CPU.  A
       process in uninterruptable state is waiting for some I/O access, eg
       waiting for disk.  The averages are taken over the three time
       intervals.  Load averages are not normalized for the number of CPUs
       in a system, so a load average of 1 means a single CPU system is
       loaded all the time while on a 4 CPU system it means it was idle 75%
       of the time.
