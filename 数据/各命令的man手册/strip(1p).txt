       A strippable file is defined as a relocatable, object, or executable
       file.  On XSI-conformant systems, a strippable file can also be an
       archive of object or relocatable files.
       The strip utility shall remove from strippable files named by the
       file operands any information the implementor deems unnecessary for
       execution of those files. The nature of that information is
       unspecified. The effect of strip on object and executable files shall
       be similar to the use of the −s option to c99 or fort77.  The effect
       of strip on an archive of object files shall be similar to the use of
       the −s option to c99 or fort77 for each object file in the archive.
