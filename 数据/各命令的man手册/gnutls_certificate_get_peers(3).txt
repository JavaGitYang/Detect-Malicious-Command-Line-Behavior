       Get the peer's raw certificate (chain) as sent by the peer.  These
       certificates are in raw format (DER encoded for X.509).  In case of a
       X.509 then a certificate list may be present.  The list is provided
       as sent by the server; the server must send as first certificate in
       the list its own certificate, following the issuer's certificate,
       then the issuer's issuer etc. However, there are servers which
       violate this principle and thus on certain occasions this may be an
       unsorted list.
       In case of OpenPGP keys a single key will be returned in raw format.
