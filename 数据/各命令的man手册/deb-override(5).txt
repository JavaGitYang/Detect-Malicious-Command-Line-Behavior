       While most information about a package can be found in the control
       file, some is managed centrally by the distribution czars rather than
       by the maintainer in order to offer some global consistency.  This
       information is found in the override file.
       The override file has a simple whitespace-delimited format. Comments
       are allowed (denoted with a #).
            package priority section [maintainerinfo]
       package is the name of the package. Entries in the override file for
       packages not found in the tree of binary packages are ignored.
       priority and section correspond to the respective control fields
       available in the .deb. The allowed values are specific to each
       distribution archive.
       maintainerinfo, if present, can be either the name of a maintainer
       for an unconditional override, or else oldmaintainer => newmaintainer
       to perform a substitution.
       The override files used to make the official Packages lists may be
       found in the indices directory on any Debian mirror.
