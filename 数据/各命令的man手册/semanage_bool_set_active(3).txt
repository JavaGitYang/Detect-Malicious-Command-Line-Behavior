       Behavior:
              The set function will fail if no matching key is found in the
              local store. Otherwise, the provided object will replace the
              current one. When semanage_commit(3) is invoked, changes will
              be written permanently into the local store, and will be
              loaded into policy. Validity of the object being added is
              checked at commit time.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The key identifies the data
              object, which will be written into the store. The key are data
              are properties of the caller, and are not stored or modified
              internally.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) ), and must be executed
              in a transaction (see semanage_begin_transaction(3) ).
