       The lttng destroy command destroys one or more tracing sessions.
       If no options are specified, the current tracing session is destroyed
       (see lttng-create(1) for more information about the current tracing
       session).
       If SESSION is specified, the existing tracing session named SESSION
       is destroyed. lttng list outputs all the existing tracing sessions
       (see lttng-list(1)).
       If the --all option is used, all the tracing sessions, as listed in
       the output of lttng list, are destroyed.
       Destroying a tracing session stops any tracing running within the
       latter. By default, the implicit lttng-stop(1) command invoked by the
       lttng destroy command ensures that the tracing session’s trace data
       is valid before returning. With the --no-wait option, the
       lttng-stop(1) command finishes immediately, hence a local trace might
       not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there is no way
       to know when the trace becomes valid.
       Destroying a tracing session does not destroy the recorded trace
       data, if any; it frees resources acquired by the session daemon and
       tracer side, making sure to flush all trace data.
       If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing session’s
       lifetime (see lttng-rotate(1) and lttng-enable-rotation(1)), and
       without the --no-wait option, all the tracing session’s output
       directory’s subdirectories are considered trace chunk archives once
       the command returns: it is safe to read them, modify them, move them,
       or remove them.
