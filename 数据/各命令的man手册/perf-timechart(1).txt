       There are two variants of perf timechart:
           'perf timechart record <command>' to record the system level events
           of an arbitrary workload. By default timechart records only scheduler
           and CPU events (task switches, running times, CPU power states, etc),
           but it's possible to record IO (disk, network) activity using -I argument.
           'perf timechart' to turn a trace into a Scalable Vector Graphics file,
           that can be viewed with popular SVG viewers such as 'Inkscape'. Depending
           on the events in the perf.data file, timechart will contain scheduler/cpu
           events or IO events.
           In IO mode, every bar has two charts: upper and lower.
           Upper bar shows incoming events (disk reads, ingress network packets).
           Lower bar shows outgoing events (disk writes, egress network packets).
           There are also poll bars which show how much time application spent
           in poll/epoll/select syscalls.
