       Create a new, empty patch on the current stack. The new patch is
       created on top of the currently applied patches, and is made the new
       top of the stack. Uncommitted changes in the work tree are not
       included in the patch — that is handled by stg-refresh(1).
       The given name must be unique in the stack, and may only contain
       alphanumeric characters, dashes and underscores. If no name is given,
       one is generated from the first line of the patch’s commit message.
       An editor will be launched to edit the commit message to be used for
       the patch, unless the --message flag already specified one. The
       patchdescr.tmpl template file (if available) is used to pre-fill the
       editor.
