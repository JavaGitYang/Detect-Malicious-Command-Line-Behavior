       pam_securetty is a PAM module that allows root logins only if the
       user is logging in on a "secure" tty, as defined by the listing in
       /etc/securetty. pam_securetty also checks to make sure that
       /etc/securetty is a plain file and not world writable. It will also
       allow root logins on the tty specified with console= switch on the
       kernel command line and on ttys from the
       /sys/class/tty/console/active.
       This module has no effect on non-root users and requires that the
       application fills in the PAM_TTY item correctly.
       For canonical usage, should be listed as a required authentication
       method before any sufficient authentication methods.
