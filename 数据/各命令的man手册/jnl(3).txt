       The j0() and j1() functions return Bessel functions of x of the first
       kind of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  The jn() function returns the
       Bessel function of x of the first kind of order n.
       The j0f(), j1f(), and jnf(), functions are versions that take and
       return float values.  The j0l(), j1l(), and jnl() functions are
       versions that take and return long double values.
