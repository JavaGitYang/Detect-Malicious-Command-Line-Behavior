       ldapmodify is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_add_ext(3),
       ldap_modify_ext(3), ldap_delete_ext(3) and ldap_rename(3).  library
       calls.  ldapadd is implemented as a hard link to the ldapmodify tool.
       When invoked as ldapadd the -a (add new entry) flag is turned on
       automatically.
       ldapmodify opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and modifies
       or adds entries.  The entry information is read from standard input
       or from file through the use of the -f option.
