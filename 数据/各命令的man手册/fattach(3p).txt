       The fattach() function shall attach a STREAMS-based file descriptor
       to a file, effectively associating a pathname with fildes.  The
       application shall ensure that the fildes argument is a valid open
       file descriptor associated with a STREAMS file. The path argument
       points to a pathname of an existing file. The application shall have
       appropriate privileges or be the owner of the file named by path and
       have write permission. A successful call to fattach() shall cause all
       pathnames that name the file named by path to name the STREAMS file
       associated with fildes, until the STREAMS file is detached from the
       file. A STREAMS file can be attached to more than one file and can
       have several pathnames associated with it.
       The attributes of the named STREAMS file shall be initialized as
       follows: the permissions, user ID, group ID, and times are set to
       those of the file named by path, the number of links is set to 1, and
       the size and device identifier are set to those of the STREAMS file
       associated with fildes.  If any attributes of the named STREAMS file
       are subsequently changed (for example, by chmod()), neither the
       attributes of the underlying file nor the attributes of the STREAMS
       file to which fildes refers shall be affected.
       File descriptors referring to the underlying file, opened prior to an
       fattach() call, shall continue to refer to the underlying file.
