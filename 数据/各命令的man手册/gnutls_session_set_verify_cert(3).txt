       This function instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate using
       the provided hostname. If the verification fails the handshake will
       also fail with GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR. In that case
       the verification result can be obtained using
       gnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status().
       The  hostname pointer provided must remain valid for the lifetime of
       the session. More precisely it should be available during any
       subsequent handshakes. If no hostname is provided, no hostname
       verification will be performed. For a more advanced verification
       function check gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2().
       If  flags is provided which contain a profile, this function should
       be called after any session priority setting functions.
       The gnutls_session_set_verify_cert() function is intended to be used
       by TLS clients to verify the server's certificate.
