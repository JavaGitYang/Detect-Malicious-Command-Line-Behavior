       dh_md5sums is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating
       a DEBIAN/md5sums file, which lists the md5sums of each file in the
       package.  These files are used by dpkg --verify or the debsums(1)
       program.
       All files in DEBIAN/ are omitted from the md5sums file, as are all
       conffiles (unless you use the --include-conffiles switch).
       The md5sums file is installed with proper permissions and ownerships.
