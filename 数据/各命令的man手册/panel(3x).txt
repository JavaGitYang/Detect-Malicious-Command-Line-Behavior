       Panels are curses(3X) windows with the added feature of depth.  Panel
       functions allow the use of stacked windows and ensure the proper
       portions of each window and the curses stdscr window are hidden or
       displayed when panels are added, moved, modified or removed.  The set
       of currently visible panels is the stack of panels.  The stdscr
       window is beneath all panels, and is not considered part of the
       stack.
       A window is associated with every panel. The panel routines enable
       you to create, move, hide, and show panels, as well as position a
       panel at any desired location in the stack.
       Panel routines are a functional layer added to curses(3X), make only
       high-level curses calls, and work anywhere terminfo curses does.
