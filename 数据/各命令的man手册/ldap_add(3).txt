       The ldap_add_ext_s() routine is used to perform an LDAP add
       operation.  It takes dn, the DN of the entry to add, and attrs, a
       null-terminated array of the entry's attributes.  The LDAPMod
       structure is used to represent attributes, with the mod_type and
       mod_values fields being used as described under ldap_modify_ext(3),
       and the ldap_op field being used only if you need to specify the
       LDAP_MOD_BVALUES option. Otherwise, it should be set to zero.
       Note that all entries except that specified by the last component in
       the given DN must already exist.  ldap_add_ext_s() returns an code
       indicating success or, in the case of failure, indicating the nature
       of failure of the operation.  See ldap_error(3) for more details.
       The ldap_add_ext() routine works just like ldap_add_ext_s(), but it
       is asynchronous.  It returns the message id of the request it
       initiated.  The result of this operation can be obtained by calling
       ldap_result(3).
