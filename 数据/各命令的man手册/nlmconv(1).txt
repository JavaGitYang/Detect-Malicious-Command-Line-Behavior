       nlmconv converts the relocatable i386 object file infile into the
       NetWare Loadable Module outfile, optionally reading headerfile for
       NLM header information.  For instructions on writing the NLM command
       file language used in header files, see the linkers section, NLMLINK
       in particular, of the NLM Development and Tools Overview, which is
       part of the NLM Software Developer's Kit ("NLM SDK"), available from
       Novell, Inc.  nlmconv uses the GNU Binary File Descriptor library to
       read infile;
       nlmconv can perform a link step.  In other words, you can list more
       than one object file for input if you list them in the definitions
       file (rather than simply specifying one input file on the command
       line).  In this case, nlmconv calls the linker for you.
