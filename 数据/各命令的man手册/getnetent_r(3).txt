       The getnetent_r(), getnetbyname_r(), and getnetbyaddr_r() functions
       are the reentrant equivalents of, respectively, getnetent(3),
       getnetbyname(3), and getnetbynumber(3).  They differ in the way that
       the netent structure is returned, and in the function calling
       signature and return value.  This manual page describes just the
       differences from the nonreentrant functions.
       Instead of returning a pointer to a statically allocated netent
       structure as the function result, these functions copy the structure
       into the location pointed to by result_buf.
       The buf array is used to store the string fields pointed to by the
       returned netent structure.  (The nonreentrant functions allocate
       these strings in static storage.)  The size of this array is
       specified in buflen.  If buf is too small, the call fails with the
       error ERANGE, and the caller must try again with a larger buffer.  (A
       buffer of length 1024 bytes should be sufficient for most
       applications.)
       If the function call successfully obtains a network record, then
       *result is set pointing to result_buf; otherwise, *result is set to
       NULL.
       The buffer pointed to by h_errnop is used to return the value that
       would be stored in the global variable h_errno by the nonreentrant
       versions of these functions.
