       The readprofile command uses the /proc/profile information to print
       ascii data on standard output.  The output is organized in three
       columns: the first is the number of clock ticks, the second is the
       name of the C function in the kernel where those many ticks occurred,
       and the third is the normalized `load' of the procedure, calculated
       as a ratio between the number of ticks and the length of the
       procedure.  The output is filled with blanks to ease readability.
