       The /etc/group file is a text file that defines the groups on the
       system.  There is one entry per line, with the following format:
           group_name:password:GID:user_list
       The fields are as follows:
       group_name  the name of the group.
       password    the (encrypted) group password.  If this field is empty,
                   no password is needed.
       GID         the numeric group ID.
       user_list   a list of the usernames that are members of this group,
                   separated by commas.
