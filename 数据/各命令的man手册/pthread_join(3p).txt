       The pthread_join() function shall suspend execution of the calling
       thread until the target thread terminates, unless the target thread
       has already terminated. On return from a successful pthread_join()
       call with a non-NULL value_ptr argument, the value passed to
       pthread_exit() by the terminating thread shall be made available in
       the location referenced by value_ptr.  When a pthread_join() returns
       successfully, the target thread has been terminated. The results of
       multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_join() specifying the same
       target thread are undefined. If the thread calling pthread_join() is
       canceled, then the target thread shall not be detached.
       It is unspecified whether a thread that has exited but remains
       unjoined counts against {PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX}.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread
       argument to pthread_join() does not refer to a joinable thread.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread
       argument to pthread_join() refers to the calling thread.
