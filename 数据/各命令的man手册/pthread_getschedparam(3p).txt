       The pthread_getschedparam() and pthread_setschedparam() functions
       shall, respectively, get and set the scheduling policy and parameters
       of individual threads within a multi-threaded process to be retrieved
       and set. For SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR, the only required member of the
       sched_param structure is the priority sched_priority.  For
       SCHED_OTHER, the affected scheduling parameters are implementation-
       defined.
       The pthread_getschedparam() function shall retrieve the scheduling
       policy and scheduling parameters for the thread whose thread ID is
       given by thread and shall store those values in policy and param,
       respectively. The priority value returned from
       pthread_getschedparam() shall be the value specified by the most
       recent pthread_setschedparam(), pthread_setschedprio(), or
       pthread_create() call affecting the target thread. It shall not
       reflect any temporary adjustments to its priority as a result of any
       priority inheritance or ceiling functions. The
       pthread_setschedparam() function shall set the scheduling policy and
       associated scheduling parameters for the thread whose thread ID is
       given by thread to the policy and associated parameters provided in
       policy and param, respectively.
       The policy parameter may have the value SCHED_OTHER, SCHED_FIFO, or
       SCHED_RR. The scheduling parameters for the SCHED_OTHER policy are
       implementation-defined. The SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR policies shall
       have a single scheduling parameter, priority.
       If _POSIX_THREAD_SPORADIC_SERVER is defined, then the policy argument
       may have the value SCHED_SPORADIC, with the exception for the
       pthread_setschedparam() function that if the scheduling policy was
       not SCHED_SPORADIC at the time of the call, it is implementation-
       defined whether the function is supported; in other words, the
       implementation need not allow the application to dynamically change
       the scheduling policy to SCHED_SPORADIC. The sporadic server
       scheduling policy has the associated parameters
       sched_ss_low_priority, sched_ss_repl_period, sched_ss_init_budget,
       sched_priority, and sched_ss_max_repl.  The specified
       sched_ss_repl_period shall be greater than or equal to the specified
       sched_ss_init_budget for the function to succeed; if it is not, then
       the function shall fail. The value of sched_ss_max_repl shall be
       within the inclusive range [1,{SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to
       succeed; if not, the function shall fail.  It is unspecified whether
       the sched_ss_repl_period and sched_ss_init_budget values are stored
       as provided by this function or are rounded to align with the
       resolution of the clock being used.
       If the pthread_setschedparam() function fails, the scheduling
       parameters shall not be changed for the target thread.
