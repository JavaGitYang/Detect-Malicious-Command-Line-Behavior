       pcp-verify inspects various aspects of a PCP collector installation
       and reports on whether it is configured correctly for certain modes
       of operation.
       By default, pcp-verify checks that PMCD is running and no agents are
       in a failed state.  These checks can be extended and refined using
       the command line.
