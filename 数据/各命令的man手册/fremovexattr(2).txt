       Extended attributes are name:value pairs associated with inodes
       (files, directories, symbolic links, etc.).  They are extensions to
       the normal attributes which are associated with all inodes in the
       system (i.e., the stat(2) data).  A complete overview of extended
       attributes concepts can be found in xattr(7).
       removexattr() removes the extended attribute identified by name and
       associated with the given path in the filesystem.
       lremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), except in the case of a
       symbolic link, where the extended attribute is removed from the link
       itself, not the file that it refers to.
       fremovexattr() is identical to removexattr(), only the extended
       attribute is removed from the open file referred to by fd (as
       returned by open(2)) in place of path.
       An extended attribute name is a null-terminated string.  The name
       includes a namespace prefix; there may be several, disjoint
       namespaces associated with an individual inode.
