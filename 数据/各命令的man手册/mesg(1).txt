       The mesg utility is invoked by a user to control write access others
       have to the terminal device associated with standard error output.
       If write access is allowed, then programs such as talk(1) and
       write(1) may display messages on the terminal.
       Traditionally, write access is allowed by default.  However, as users
       become more conscious of various security risks, there is a trend to
       remove write access by default, at least for the primary login shell.
       To make sure your ttys are set the way you want them to be set, mesg
       should be executed in your login scripts.
