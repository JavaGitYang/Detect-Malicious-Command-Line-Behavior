       cal displays a simple calendar.  If no arguments are specified, the
       current month is displayed.
       The month may be specified as a number (1-12), as a month name or as
       an abbreviated month name according to the current locales.
       Two different calendar systems are used, Gregorian and Julian.  These
       are nearly identical systems with Gregorian making a small adjustment
       to the frequency of leap years; this facilitates improved
       synchronization with solar events like the equinoxes.  The Gregorian
       calendar reform was introduced in 1582, but its adoption continued up
       to 1923.  By default cal uses the adoption date of 3 Sept 1752.  From
       that date forward the Gregorian calendar is displayed; previous dates
       use the Julian calendar system.  11 days were removed at the time of
       adoption to bring the calendar in sync with solar events.  So Sept
       1752 has a mix of Julian and Gregorian dates by which the 2nd is
       followed by the 14th (the 3rd through the 13th are absent).
       Optionally, either the proleptic Gregorian calendar or the Julian
       calendar may be used exclusively.  See --reform below.
