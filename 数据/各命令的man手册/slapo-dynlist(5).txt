       The dynlist overlay to slapd(8) allows expansion of dynamic groups
       and more.  Any time an entry with a specific objectClass (defined in
       the overlay configuration) is being returned, the LDAP URI-valued
       occurrences of a specific attribute (also defined in the overlay
       configuration) are expanded into the corresponding entries, and the
       values of the attributes listed in the URI are added to the original
       entry.  No recursion is allowed, to avoid potential infinite loops.
       Since the resulting entry is dynamically constructed, it does not
       exist until it is constructed while being returned.  As a
       consequence, dynamically added attributes do not participate in the
       filter matching phase of the search request handling.  In other
       words, filtering for dynamically added attributes always fails.
       The resulting entry must comply with the LDAP data model, so
       constraints are enforced.  For example, if a SINGLE-VALUE attribute
       is listed, only the first value found during the list expansion
       appears in the final entry.  The above described behavior is disabled
       when the manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used.  In that case, the
       contents of the dynamic group entry is returned; namely, the URLs are
       returned instead of being expanded.
