       The library supports the Intel Westmere uncore PMU as implemented by
       processors such as Intel Core i7, and Intel Core i5 (models 37, 44).
       The PMU is located at the socket-level and is therefore shared
       between the various cores. By construction it can only measure at all
       privilege levels.
