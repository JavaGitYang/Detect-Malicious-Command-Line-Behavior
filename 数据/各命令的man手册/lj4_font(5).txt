       Nominally, all Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4-series and newer printers
       have the same internal fonts: 45 scalable fonts and one bitmapped
       Lineprinter font.  The scalable fonts are available in sizes between
       0.25 points and 999.75 points, in 0.25-point increments; the
       Lineprinter font is available only in 8.5-point size.
       The LaserJet font files included with groff assume that all printers
       since the LaserJet 4 are identical.  There are some differences
       between fonts in the earlier and more recent printers, however.  The
       LaserJet 4 printer used Agfa Intellifont technology for 35 of the
       internal scalable fonts; the remaining 10 scalable fonts were
       TrueType.  Beginning with the LaserJet 4000-series printers
       introduced in 1997, all scalable internal fonts have been TrueType.
       The number of printable glyphs differs slightly between Intellifont
       and TrueType fonts (generally, the TrueType fonts include more
       glyphs), and there are some minor differences in glyph metrics.
       Differences among printer models are described in the PCL 5
       Comparison Guide and the PCL 5 Comparison Guide Addendum (for
       printers introduced since approximately 2001).
       LaserJet printers reference a glyph by a combination of a 256-glyph
       symbol set and an index within that symbol set.  Many glyphs appear
       in more than one symbol set; all combinations of symbol set and index
       that reference the same glyph are equivalent.  For each glyph,
       hpftodit(1) searches a list of symbol sets, and selects the first set
       that contains the glyph.  The printing code generated by hpftodit(1)
       is an integer that encodes a numerical value for the symbol set in
       the high byte(s), and the index in the low byte.  See groff_font(5)
       for a complete description of the font file format; symbol sets are
       described in greater detail in the PCL 5 Printer Language Technical
       Reference Manual.
       Two of the scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to
       256-glyph symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as the
       Lineprinter font, support numerous symbol sets, sufficient to enable
       printing of more than 600 glyphs.
       The metrics generated by hpftodit(1) assume that the DESC file
       contains values of 1200 for res and 6350 for unitwidth, or any
       combination (e.g., 2400 and 3175) for which res × unitwidth =
       7620000.  Although HP PCL 5 LaserJet printers support an internal
       resolution of 7200 units per inch, they use a 16-bit signed integer
       for cursor positioning; if devlj4 is to support U.S. ledger paper
       (11 in × 17 in; in = inch), the maximum usable resolution is
       32767 ÷ 17, or 1927 units per inch, which rounds down to 1200 units
       per inch.  If the largest required paper size is less (e.g.,
       8.5 in × 11 in, or A5), a greater res (and lesser unitwidth) can be
       specified.
