     The acl_extended_fd() function returns 1 if the file identified by the
     argument fd is associated with an extended access ACL. The function
     returns 0 if the file does not have an extended access ACL.
     An extended ACL is an ACL that contains entries other than the three
     required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ and
     ACL_OTHER.  If the result of the acl_extended_fd() function for a file
     object is 0, then the ACL defines no discretionary access rights other
     than those already defined by the traditional file permission bits.
     Access to the file object may be further restricted by other mecha‚Äê
     nisms, such as Mandatory Access Control schemes. The access(2) system
     call can be used to check whether a given type of access to a file
     object would be granted.
