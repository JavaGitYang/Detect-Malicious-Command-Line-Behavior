       Retrieve descriptive text about the performance metrics instance
       domain identified by indom.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       The argument level should be PM_TEXT_ONELINE for a one-line summary,
       else PM_TEXT_HELP for a more verbose description, suited to a help
       dialog.
       The space pointed to by buffer will have been allocated in
       pmLookupInDomText with malloc(3), and it is the responsibility of the
       caller to free(3) the space when it is no longer required.
       pmLookupInDomText returns zero on success.
