       ipc() is a common kernel entry point for the System V IPC calls for
       messages, semaphores, and shared memory.  call determines which IPC
       function to invoke; the other arguments are passed through to the
       appropriate call.
       User-space programs should call the appropriate functions by their
       usual names.  Only standard library implementors and kernel hackers
       need to know about ipc().
