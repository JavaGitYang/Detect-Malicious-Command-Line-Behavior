       The posix_fadvise() function shall advise the implementation on the
       expected behavior of the application with respect to the data in the
       file associated with the open file descriptor, fd, starting at offset
       and continuing for len bytes. The specified range need not currently
       exist in the file. If len is zero, all data following offset is
       specified. The implementation may use this information to optimize
       handling of the specified data. The posix_fadvise() function shall
       have no effect on the semantics of other operations on the specified
       data, although it may affect the performance of other operations.
       The advice to be applied to the data is specified by the advice
       parameter and may be one of the following values:
       POSIX_FADV_NORMAL
             Specifies that the application has no advice to give on its
             behavior with respect to the specified data. It is the default
             characteristic if no advice is given for an open file.
       POSIX_FADV_SEQUENTIAL
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             data sequentially from lower offsets to higher offsets.
       POSIX_FADV_RANDOM
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             data in a random order.
       POSIX_FADV_WILLNEED
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             data in the near future.
       POSIX_FADV_DONTNEED
             Specifies that the application expects that it will not access
             the specified data in the near future.
       POSIX_FADV_NOREUSE
             Specifies that the application expects to access the specified
             data once and then not reuse it thereafter.
       These values are defined in <fcntl.h>.
