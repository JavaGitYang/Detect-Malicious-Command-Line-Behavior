       This is the first function that a program must call otherwise the
       library will not operate.  This function probes the underlying
       hardware looking for valid PMU event tables to activate.  Multiple
       distinct PMU tables may be activated at the same time.
       The function must be called only once. If the function is called more
       than once, it does not execute the initialization multiple times, it
       simply returns the same value as for the first call.
