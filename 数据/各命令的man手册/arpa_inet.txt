       The <arpa/inet.h> header shall define the in_port_t and in_addr_t
       types as described in <netinet/in.h>.
       The <arpa/inet.h> header shall define the in_addr structure as
       described in <netinet/in.h>.
       The <arpa/inet.h> header shall define the INET_ADDRSTRLEN and
       INET6_ADDRSTRLEN macros as described in <netinet/in.h>.
       The following shall be declared as functions, or defined as macros,
       or both. If functions are declared, function prototypes shall be
       provided.
           uint32_t htonl(uint32_t);
           uint16_t htons(uint16_t);
           uint32_t ntohl(uint32_t);
           uint16_t ntohs(uint16_t);
       The <arpa/inet.h> header shall define the uint32_t and uint16_t types
       as described in <inttypes.h>.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           in_addr_t    inet_addr(const char *);
           char        *inet_ntoa(struct in_addr);
           const char  *inet_ntop(int, const void *restrict, char *restrict,
                            socklen_t);
           int          inet_pton(int, const char *restrict, void *restrict);
       Inclusion of the <arpa/inet.h> header may also make visible all
       symbols from <netinet/in.h> and <inttypes.h>.
