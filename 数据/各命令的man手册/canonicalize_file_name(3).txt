       The canonicalize_file_name() function returns a null-terminated
       string containing the canonicalized absolute pathname corresponding
       to path.  In the returned string, symbolic links are resolved, as are
       .  and ..  pathname components.  Consecutive slash (/) characters are
       replaced by a single slash.
       The returned string is dynamically allocated by
       canonicalize_file_name() and the caller should deallocate it with
       free(3) when it is no longer required.
       The call canonicalize_file_name(path) is equivalent to the call:
           realpath(path, NULL);
