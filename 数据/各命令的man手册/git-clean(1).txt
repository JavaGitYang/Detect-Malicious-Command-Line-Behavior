       Cleans the working tree by recursively removing files that are not
       under version control, starting from the current directory.
       Normally, only files unknown to Git are removed, but if the -x option
       is specified, ignored files are also removed. This can, for example,
       be useful to remove all build products.
       If any optional <path>... arguments are given, only those paths are
       affected.
