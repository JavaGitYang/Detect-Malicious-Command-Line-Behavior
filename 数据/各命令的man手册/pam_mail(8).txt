       The pam_mail PAM module provides the "you have new mail" service to
       the user. It can be plugged into any application that has credential
       or session hooks. It gives a single message indicating the newness of
       any mail it finds in the user's mail folder. This module also sets
       the PAM environment variable, MAIL, to the user's mail directory.
       If the mail spool file (be it /var/mail/$USER or a pathname given
       with the dir= parameter) is a directory then pam_mail assumes it is
       in the Maildir format.
