       The iconv program reads in text in one encoding and outputs the text
       in another encoding.  If no input files are given, or if it is given
       as a dash (-), iconv reads from standard input.  If no output file is
       given, iconv writes to standard output.
       If no from-encoding is given, the default is derived from the current
       locale's character encoding.  If no to-encoding is given, the default
       is derived from the current locale's character encoding.
