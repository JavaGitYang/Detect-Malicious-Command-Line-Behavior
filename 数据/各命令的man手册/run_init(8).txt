       Run a init script under the proper context, which is specified in
       /etc/selinux/POLICYTYPE/contexts/initrc_context.  It is generally
       used interactively as it requires either shadow or PAM user
       authentication (depending on compile-time options).  It should be
       possible to configure PAM such that interactive input is not
       required.  Check your PAM documentation.
