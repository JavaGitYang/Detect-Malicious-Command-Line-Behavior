       The lttng regenerate command regenerates specific data of a tracing
       session.
       As of this version, the metadata and statedump actions are available.
   Regenerating a tracing session’s metadata
       The lttng regenerate metadata action can be used to resample the
       offset between the system’s monotonic clock and the wall-clock time.
       This action is meant to be used to resample the wall-clock time
       following a major NTP
       <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol> correction. As
       such, a system booting with an incorrect wall time can be traced
       before its wall time is NTP-corrected. Regenerating the tracing
       session’s metadata ensures that trace viewers can accurately
       determine the events time relative to Unix Epoch.
       If you use lttng-rotate(1) or lttng-enable-rotation(1) to make
       tracing session rotations, this action regenerates the current and
       next trace chunks’s metadata files.
   Regenerating a tracing session’s state dump
       The lttng regenerate statedump action can be used to collect
       up-to-date state dump information during the tracing session. This is
       particularly useful in snapshot (see lttng-snapshot(1)) or trace file
       rotation (see lttng-enable-channel(1)) modes where the state dump
       information may be lost.
