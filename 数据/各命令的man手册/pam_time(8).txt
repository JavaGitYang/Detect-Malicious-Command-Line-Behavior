       The pam_time PAM module does not authenticate the user, but instead
       it restricts access to a system and or specific applications at
       various times of the day and on specific days or over various
       terminal lines. This module can be configured to deny access to
       (individual) users based on their name, the time of day, the day of
       week, the service they are applying for and their terminal from which
       they are making their request.
       By default rules for time/port access are taken from config file
       /etc/security/time.conf.
       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report
       when it denies access.
