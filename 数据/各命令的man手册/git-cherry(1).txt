       Determine whether there are commits in <head>..<upstream> that are
       equivalent to those in the range <limit>..<head>.
       The equivalence test is based on the diff, after removing whitespace
       and line numbers. git-cherry therefore detects when commits have been
       "copied" by means of git-cherry-pick(1), git-am(1) or git-rebase(1).
       Outputs the SHA1 of every commit in <limit>..<head>, prefixed with -
       for commits that have an equivalent in <upstream>, and + for commits
       that do not.
