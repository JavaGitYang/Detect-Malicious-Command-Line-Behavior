       The pthread_detach() function shall indicate to the implementation
       that storage for the thread thread can be reclaimed when that thread
       terminates. If thread has not terminated, pthread_detach() shall not
       cause it to terminate.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the thread
       argument to pthread_detach() does not refer to a joinable thread.
