       Hooks are programs you can place in a hooks directory to trigger
       actions at certain points in git’s execution. Hooks that don’t have
       the executable bit set are ignored.
       By default the hooks directory is $GIT_DIR/hooks, but that can be
       changed via the core.hooksPath configuration variable (see
       git-config(1)).
       Before Git invokes a hook, it changes its working directory to either
       $GIT_DIR in a bare repository or the root of the working tree in a
       non-bare repository. An exception are hooks triggered during a push
       (pre-receive, update, post-receive, post-update, push-to-checkout)
       which are always executed in $GIT_DIR.
       Hooks can get their arguments via the environment, command-line
       arguments, and stdin. See the documentation for each hook below for
       details.
       git init may copy hooks to the new repository, depending on its
       configuration. See the "TEMPLATE DIRECTORY" section in git-init(1)
       for details. When the rest of this document refers to "default hooks"
       it’s talking about the default template shipped with Git.
       The currently supported hooks are described below.
