       The wcscspn() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       strcspn(3) function.  It determines the length of the longest initial
       segment of wcs which consists entirely of wide-characters not listed
       in reject.  In other words, it searches for the first occurrence in
       the wide-character string wcs of any of the characters in the wide-
       character string reject.
