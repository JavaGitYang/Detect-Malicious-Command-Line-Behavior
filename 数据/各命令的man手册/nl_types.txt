       The <nl_types.h> header shall define at least the following types:
       nl_catd       Used by the message catalog functions catopen(),
                     catgets(), and catclose() to identify a catalog
                     descriptor.
       nl_item       Used by nl_langinfo() to identify items of langinfo
                     data. Values of objects of type nl_item are defined in
                     <langinfo.h>.
       The <nl_types.h> header shall define at least the following symbolic
       constants:
       NL_SETD       Used by gencat when no $set directive is specified in a
                     message text source file. This constant can be passed
                     as the value of set_id on subsequent calls to catgets()
                     (that is, to retrieve messages from the default message
                     set). The value of NL_SETD is implementation-defined.
       NL_CAT_LOCALE Value that must be passed as the oflag argument to
                     catopen() to ensure that message catalog selection
                     depends on the LC_MESSAGES locale category, rather than
                     directly on the LANG environment variable.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int       catclose(nl_catd);
           char     *catgets(nl_catd, int, int, const char *);
           nl_catd   catopen(const char *, int);
