       rpmatch() handles a user response to yes or no questions, with
       support for internationalization.
       response should be a null-terminated string containing a user-
       supplied response, perhaps obtained with fgets(3) or getline(3).
       The user's language preference is taken into account per the
       environment variables LANG, LC_MESSAGES, and LC_ALL, if the program
       has called setlocale(3) to effect their changes.
       Regardless of the locale, responses matching ^[Yy] are always
       accepted as affirmative, and those matching ^[Nn] are always accepted
       as negative.
