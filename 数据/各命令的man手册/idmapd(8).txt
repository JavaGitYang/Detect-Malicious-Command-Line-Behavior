     rpc.idmapd is the NFSv4 ID <-> name mapping daemon.  It provides func‐
     tionality to the NFSv4 kernel client and server, to which it communi‐
     cates via upcalls, by translating user and group IDs to names, and vice
     versa.
     The system derives the part of the string by performing a password or
     group lookup.  The lookup mechanism is configured in /etc/idmapd.conf
     By default, the part of the string is the system's DNS domain name.  It
     can also be specified in /etc/idmapd.conf if the system is multi-homed,
     or if the system's DNS domain name does not match the name of the sys‐
     tem's Kerberos realm.
     When the domain is not specified in /etc/idmapd.conf the local DNS
     server will be queried for the _nfsv4idmapdomain text record. If the
     record exists that will be used as the domain. When the record does not
     exist, the domain part of the DNS domain will used.
     Note that on more recent kernels only the NFSv4 server uses rpc.idmapd.
     The NFSv4 client instead uses nfsidmap(8), and only falls back to
     rpc.idmapd if there was a problem running the nfsidmap(8) program.
     The options are as follows:
     -h           Display usage message.
     -v           Increases the verbosity level (can be specified multiple
                  times).
     -f           Runs rpc.idmapd in the foreground and prints all output to
                  the terminal.
     -p path      Specifies the location of the RPC pipefs to be path.  The
                  default value is "/var/lib/nfs/rpc_pipefs".
     -c path      Use configuration file path.  This option is deprecated.
     -C           Client-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS server, even
                  if one is detected.
     -S           Server-only: perform no idmapping for any NFS client, even
                  if one is detected.
