       This function will return the alternative names, contained in the
       given certificate. It is the same as
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_issuer_alt_name() except for the fact that it
       will return the type of the alternative name in  ian_type even if the
       function fails for some reason (i.e.  the buffer provided is not
       enough).
