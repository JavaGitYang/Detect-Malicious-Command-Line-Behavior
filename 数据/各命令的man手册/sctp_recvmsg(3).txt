       sctp_recvmsg is a wrapper library function that can be used to
       receive a message from a socket while using the advanced features of
       SCTP.  sd is the socket descriptor on which the message pointed to by
       msg of length len is received.
       If from is not NULL, the source address of the message is filled in.
       The argument fromlen is a value-result parameter. initialized to the
       size of the buffer associated with from , and modified on return to
       indicate the actual size of the address stored.
       sinfo is a pointer to a sctp_sndrcvinfo structure to be filled upon
       receipt of the message.  msg_flags is a pointer to a integer that is
       filled with any message flags like MSG_NOTIFICATION or MSG_EOR.
