       pmdadocker is a docker Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exposes performance metrics as reported from the Docker Remote API.
       A brief description of the pmdadocker command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            docker.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdadocker is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
            standard error instead.
       Remote API metric requests are activated automatically and are
       fetched on a timer.  This timer is represented as a by pmdadocker via
       the docker.control.timing.  By default, pmdadocker will be set to
       fetch on a 1 second interval.
       pmdadocker will iterate over three different docker remote API calls:
       /containers/$ID/json
              Container metrics regarding the current state of the
              container. Such as PID, name or if the container is running.
       /version
              Basic version metrics about the current docker deamon in use.
       /containers/$ID/stats?stream=0
              More in depth memory and cpu metrics of the container.
