       The posix_trace_attr_getclockres() function shall copy the clock
       resolution of the clock used to generate timestamps from the clock-
       resolution attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr
       argument into the structure pointed to by the resolution argument.
       The posix_trace_attr_getcreatetime() function shall copy the trace
       stream creation time from the creation-time attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument into the structure
       pointed to by the createtime argument. The creation-time attribute
       shall represent the time of creation of the trace stream.
       The posix_trace_attr_getgenversion() function shall copy the string
       containing version information from the generation-version attribute
       of the attributes object pointed to by the attr argument into the
       string pointed to by the genversion argument. The genversion argument
       shall be the address of a character array which can store at least
       {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters.
       The posix_trace_attr_getname() function shall copy the string
       containing the trace name from the trace-name attribute of the
       attributes object pointed to by the attr argument into the string
       pointed to by the tracename argument. The tracename argument shall be
       the address of a character array which can store at least
       {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters.
       The posix_trace_attr_setname() function shall set the name in the
       trace-name attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr
       argument, using the trace name string supplied by the tracename
       argument. If the supplied string contains more than {TRACE_NAME_MAX}
       characters, the name copied into the trace-name attribute may be
       truncated to one less than the length of {TRACE_NAME_MAX} characters.
       The default value is a null string.
