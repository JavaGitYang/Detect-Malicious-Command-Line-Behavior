       Use git mergetool to run one of several merge utilities to resolve
       merge conflicts. It is typically run after git merge.
       If one or more <file> parameters are given, the merge tool program
       will be run to resolve differences on each file (skipping those
       without conflicts). Specifying a directory will include all
       unresolved files in that path. If no <file> names are specified, git
       mergetool will run the merge tool program on every file with merge
       conflicts.
