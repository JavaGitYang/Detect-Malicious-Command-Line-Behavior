       pmdajson is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metrics from arbitrary sources generating JavaScript Object Notation
       (JSON) syntax.
       At least one pair of JSON inputs are required for pmdajson to provide
       metrics for PCP clients; one describing metric metadata and one
       containing metric values data.  Metadata is read once from a file at
       PMDA startup while the data is read every time a request for metric
       values is made by a PCP client.  The data is read either from a JSON
       file or an external command generating JSON output.  More than one
       pair of JSON inputs can be used to support arbitrary number of metric
       sources in different configured directories.
       The overall JSON format description is at http://www.json.org/.
