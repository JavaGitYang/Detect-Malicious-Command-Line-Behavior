       An application using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent contexts, each
       associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some
       host, or an archive log of performance metrics as created by
       pmlogger(1).
       pmWhichContext returns a handle for the current PMAPI context, that
       may be used in the associated PMAPI routines that require a handle to
       identify a PMAPI context.
