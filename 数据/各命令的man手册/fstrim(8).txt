       fstrim is used on a mounted filesystem to discard (or "trim") blocks
       which are not in use by the filesystem.  This is useful for solid-
       state drives (SSDs) and thinly-provisioned storage.
       By default, fstrim will discard all unused blocks in the filesystem.
       Options may be used to modify this behavior based on range or size,
       as explained below.
       The mountpoint argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted.
       Running fstrim frequently, or even using mount -o discard, might
       negatively affect the lifetime of poor-quality SSD devices.  For most
       desktop and server systems a sufficient trimming frequency is once a
       week.  Note that not all devices support a queued trim, so each trim
       command incurs a performance penalty on whatever else might be trying
       to use the disk at the time.
