       sem_destroy() destroys the unnamed semaphore at the address pointed
       to by sem.
       Only a semaphore that has been initialized by sem_init(3) should be
       destroyed using sem_destroy().
       Destroying a semaphore that other processes or threads are currently
       blocked on (in sem_wait(3)) produces undefined behavior.
       Using a semaphore that has been destroyed produces undefined results,
       until the semaphore has been reinitialized using sem_init(3).
