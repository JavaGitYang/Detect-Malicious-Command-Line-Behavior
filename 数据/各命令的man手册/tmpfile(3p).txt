       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The tmpfile() function shall create a temporary file and open a
       corresponding stream. The file shall be automatically deleted when
       all references to the file are closed. The file is opened as in
       fopen() for update (w+), except that implementations may restrict the
       permissions, either by clearing the file mode bits or setting them to
       the value S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR.
       In some implementations, a permanent file may be left behind if the
       process calling tmpfile() is killed while it is processing a call to
       tmpfile().
       An error message may be written to standard error if the stream
       cannot be opened.
