       Setleds reports and changes the led flag settings of a VT (namely
       NumLock, CapsLock and ScrollLock).  Without arguments, setleds prints
       the current settings.  With arguments, it sets or clears the
       indicated flags (and leaves the others unchanged). The settings
       before and after the change are reported if the -v flag is given.
       The led flag settings are specific for each VT (and the VT
       corresponding to stdin is used).
       By default (or with option -F), setleds will only change the VT flags
       (and their setting may be reflected by the keyboard leds).
       With option -D, setleds will change both the VT flags and their
       default settings (so that a subsequent reset will not undo the
       change).  This might be useful for people who always want to have
       numlock set.
       With option -L, setleds will not touch the VT flags, but only change
       the leds.  From this moment on, the leds will no longer reflect the
       VT flags (but display whatever is put into them). The command setleds
       -L (without further arguments) will restore the situation in which
       the leds reflect the VT flags.
       One might use setleds in /etc/rc to define the initial and default
       state of NumLock, e.g. by
            INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
            for tty in $INITTY; do
                 setleds -D +num < $tty
            done
