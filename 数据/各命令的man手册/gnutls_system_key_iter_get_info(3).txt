       This function will return on each call a certificate and key pair
       URLs, as well as a label associated with them, and the DER-encoded
       certificate. When the iteration is complete it will return
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE.
       Typically  cert_type should be GNUTLS_CRT_X509.
       All values set are allocated and must be cleared using gnutls_free(),
