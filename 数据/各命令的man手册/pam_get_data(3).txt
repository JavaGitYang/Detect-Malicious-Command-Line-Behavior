       This function together with the pam_set_data(3) function is useful to
       manage module-specific data meaningful only to the calling PAM
       module.
       The pam_get_data function looks up the object associated with the
       (hopefully) unique string module_data_name in the PAM context
       specified by the pamh argument. A successful call to pam_get_data
       will result in data pointing to the object. Note, this data is not a
       copy and should be treated as constant by the module.
