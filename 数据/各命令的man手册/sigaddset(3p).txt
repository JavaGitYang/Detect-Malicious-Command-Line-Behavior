       The sigaddset() function adds the individual signal specified by the
       signo to the signal set pointed to by set.
       Applications shall call either sigemptyset() or sigfillset() at least
       once for each object of type sigset_t prior to any other use of that
       object. If such an object is not initialized in this way, but is
       nonetheless supplied as an argument to any of pthread_sigmask(),
       sigaction(), sigaddset(), sigdelset(), sigismember(), sigpending(),
       sigprocmask(), sigsuspend(), sigtimedwait(), sigwait(), or
       sigwaitinfo(), the results are undefined.
