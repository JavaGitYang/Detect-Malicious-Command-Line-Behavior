       PCP contexts of type PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL are used by clients that wish
       to fetch metrics directly from one or more PMDAs on the local host
       without involving pmcd(1).  A PMDA that is to be used in this way
       must have been built as a Dynamic Shared Object (DSO).
       Historically the table of PMDAs available for use with
       PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL was hardcoded to the following:
       * The PMDA (or PMDAs) that export the operating system performance
         data and data about process activity.
       * The mmv PMDA.
       * The sample PMDA provided $PCP_LITE_SAMPLE or $PMDA_LOCAL_SAMPLE is
         set in the environment - used mostly for QA and testing.
       The initial table of PMDAs available for use with PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL is
       now generated dynamically from all those PMDAs that have been
       installed as DSOs on the local host.  The one exception is the
       ``pmcd'' PMDA which only operates correctly in the address space of a
       running pmcd(1) process and so is not available to an application
       using a PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL context.
       __pmLocalPMDA provides a number of services to amend the table of
       PMDAs available for use with PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL.
       The op argument specifies the what should be done and takes one of
       the following values and actions:
       PM_LOCAL_ADD    Append an entry to the table for the PMDA with a
                       Performance Metrics Domain (PMD) of domain, the path
                       to the DSO PMDA is given by path and the PMDA's
                       initialization routine is init.
       PM_LOCAL_DEL    Removes all entries in the table where the domain
                       matches, or the path matches.  Setting the arguments
                       domain to -1 or path to NULL to force matching on the
                       other argument.  The init argument is ignored.
       PM_LOCAL_CLEAR  Remove all entries from the table.  All the other
                       arguments are ignored in this case.
       The domain, name and init arguments have similar syntax and semantics
       to the associated fields in the pmcd(1) configuration file.  The one
       difference is the path argument which is used by __pmLocalPMDA to
       find a likely looking DSO by searching in this order:
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/path, path, $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/path.dso-suffix and finally
       path.dso-suffix (dso-suffix is the local platform specific default
       file name suffix for a DSO, e.g.  so for Linux, dylib for Mac OS X,
       dll for Windows, etc.).
