       This manual page documents briefly the ifcfg command.
       This is a simplistic script replacing one option of ifconfig ,
       namely, IP address management. It not only adds addresses, but also
       carries out Duplicate Address Detection RFC-DHCP, sends unsolicited
       ARP to update the caches of other hosts sharing the interface, adds
       some control routes and restarts Router Discovery when it is
       necessary.
