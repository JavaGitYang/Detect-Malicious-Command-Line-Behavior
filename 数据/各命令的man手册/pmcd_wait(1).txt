       pmcd_wait waits for the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD)
       to be running and accepting client connections.
       Unless directed to another host by the -h option, pmcd_wait will try
       to contact pmcd(1) on the local host.
       pmcd_wait will timeout and abandon the attempt to connect to pmcd
       after 60 seconds.  This default timeout interval may be changed using
       the -t option, where the interval argument follows the syntax
       described in PCPIntro(1) and in the simplest form may be an unsigned
       integer (the implied units in this case are seconds).
       On successful connection to pmcd an exit status of zero is returned.
       If an error or timeout occurs, then a non-zero exit status is
       returned as described below.
       The other options are as follows:
       -v     This option turns the verbose mode on.  With the verbose mode
              off (which is the default), no output will be generated.  With
              verbose mode on, error messages will be output on stderr.
