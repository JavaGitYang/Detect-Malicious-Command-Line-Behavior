       This function sets the maximum record packet size in this connection.
       This property can only be set to clients.  The server may choose not
       to accept the requested size.
       Acceptable values are 512(=2^9), 1024(=2^10), 2048(=2^11) and
       4096(=2^12).  The requested record size does get in effect
       immediately only while sending data. The receive part will take
       effect after a successful handshake.
       This function uses a TLS extension called 'max record size'.  Not all
       TLS implementations use or even understand this extension.
