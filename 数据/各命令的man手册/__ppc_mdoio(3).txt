       These functions provide hints about the usage of resources that are
       shared with other processors on the Power architecture.  They can be
       used, for example, if a program waiting on a lock intends to divert
       the shared resources to be used by other processors.
       __ppc_yield() provides a hint that performance will probably be
       improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor are
       released for use by other processors.
       __ppc_mdoio() provides a hint that performance will probably be
       improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor are
       released until all outstanding storage accesses to caching-inhibited
       storage have been completed.
       __ppc_mdoom() provides a hint that performance will probably be
       improved if shared resources dedicated to the executing processor are
       released until all outstanding storage accesses to cacheable storage
       for which the data is not in the cache have been completed.
