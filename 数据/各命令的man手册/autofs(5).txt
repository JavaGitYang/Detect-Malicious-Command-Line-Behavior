       The automounter maps are FILE, NIS, NISPLUS or LDAP (including LDAP
       via SSS) referred to by the master map of the automounter (see
       auto.master(5)).  These maps describe how file systems below the
       mount point of the map (given in the master map) are to be mounted.
       This page describes the sun map format; if another map format, other
       than amd , is specified (e.g. hesiod), this documentation does not
       apply.
       Indirect maps, except for the internal hosts map, can be changed on
       the fly and the automouter will recognize those changes on the next
       operation it performs on that map. Direct maps require a HUP signal
       be sent to the daemon to refresh their contents as does the master
       map.
