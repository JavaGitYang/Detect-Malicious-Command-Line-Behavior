       sd_event_source_unref() may be used to decrement by one the reference
       counter of the event source object specified as source. The reference
       counter is initially set to one, when the event source is created
       with calls such as sd_event_add_io(3) or sd_event_add_time(3). When
       the reference counter reaches zero it is removed from its event loop
       object and destroyed.
       sd_event_source_unrefp() is similar to sd_event_source_unref() but
       takes a pointer to a pointer to an sd_event_source object. This call
       is useful in conjunction with GCC's and LLVM's Clean-up Variable
       Attribute[1]. Note that this function is defined as inline function.
       sd_event_source_ref() may be used to increase by one the reference
       counter of the event source object specified as source.
       sd_event_source_unref(), sd_bus_creds_unrefp() and sd_bus_creds_ref()
       execute no operation if the passed event source object is NULL.
       Note that event source objects stay alive and may be dispatched as
       long as they have a reference counter greater than zero. In order to
       drop a reference of an event source and make sure the associated
       event source handler function is not called anymore it is recommended
       to combine a call of sd_event_source_unref() with a prior call to
       sd_event_source_set_enabled() with SD_EVENT_OFF.
