       This interface is obsoleted by pcap_findalldevs(3PCAP).  To find a
       default device on which to capture, call pcap_findalldevs() and, if
       the list it returns is not empty, use the first device in the list.
       (If the list is empty, there are no devices on which capture is
       possible.)
       pcap_lookupdev() returns a pointer to a string giving the name of a
       network device suitable for use with pcap_create() and
       pcap_activate(), or with pcap_open_live(), and with pcap_lookupnet().
       If there is an error, NULL is returned and errbuf is filled in with
       an appropriate error message.  errbuf is assumed to be able to hold
       at least PCAP_ERRBUF_SIZE chars.
