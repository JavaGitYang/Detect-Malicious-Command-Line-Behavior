       This manual page documents the GNU version of locate.  For each given
       pattern, locate searches one or more databases of file names and
       displays the file names that contain the pattern.  Patterns can
       contain shell-style metacharacters: `*', `?', and `[]'.  The
       metacharacters do not treat `/' or `.'  specially.  Therefore, a
       pattern `foo*bar' can match a file name that contains `foo3/bar', and
       a pattern `*duck*' can match a file name that contains `lake/.ducky'.
       Patterns that contain metacharacters should be quoted to protect them
       from expansion by the shell.
       If a pattern is a plain string — it contains no metacharacters —
       locate displays all file names in the database that contain that
       string anywhere.  If a pattern does contain metacharacters, locate
       only displays file names that match the pattern exactly.  As a
       result, patterns that contain metacharacters should usually begin
       with a `*', and will most often end with one as well.  The exceptions
       are patterns that are intended to explicitly match the beginning or
       end of a file name.
       The file name databases contain lists of files that were on the
       system when the databases were last updated.  The system
       administrator can choose the file name of the default database, the
       frequency with which the databases are updated, and the directories
       for which they contain entries; see updatedb(1).
       If locate's output is going to a terminal, unusual characters in the
       output are escaped in the same way as for the -print action of the
       find command.  If the output is not going to a terminal, file names
       are printed exactly as-is.
