       The functions getpwent_r() and fgetpwent_r() are the reentrant
       versions of getpwent(3) and fgetpwent(3).  The former reads the next
       passwd entry from the stream initialized by setpwent(3).  The latter
       reads the next passwd entry from stream.
       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:
           struct passwd {
               char    *pw_name;      /* username */
               char    *pw_passwd;    /* user password */
               uid_t    pw_uid;       /* user ID */
               gid_t    pw_gid;       /* group ID */
               char    *pw_gecos;     /* user information */
               char    *pw_dir;       /* home directory */
               char    *pw_shell;     /* shell program */
           };
       For more information about the fields of this structure, see
       passwd(5).
       The nonreentrant functions return a pointer to static storage, where
       this static storage contains further pointers to user name, password,
       gecos field, home directory and shell.  The reentrant functions
       described here return all of that in caller-provided buffers.  First
       of all there is the buffer pwbuf that can hold a struct passwd.  And
       next the buffer buf of size buflen that can hold additional strings.
       The result of these functions, the struct passwd read from the
       stream, is stored in the provided buffer *pwbuf, and a pointer to
       this struct passwd is returned in *pwbufp.
