       The memccpy() function shall copy bytes from memory area s2 into s1,
       stopping after the first occurrence of byte c (converted to an
       unsigned char) is copied, or after n bytes are copied, whichever
       comes first. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
       behavior is undefined.
