       The iconv_open() function shall return a conversion descriptor that
       describes a conversion from the codeset specified by the string
       pointed to by the fromcode argument to the codeset specified by the
       string pointed to by the tocode argument. For state-dependent
       encodings, the conversion descriptor shall be in a codeset-dependent
       initial shift state, ready for immediate use with iconv().
       Settings of fromcode and tocode and their permitted combinations are
       implementation-defined.
       A conversion descriptor shall remain valid until it is closed by
       iconv_close() or an implicit close.
       If a file descriptor is used to implement conversion descriptors, the
       FD_CLOEXEC flag shall be set; see <fcntl.h>.
