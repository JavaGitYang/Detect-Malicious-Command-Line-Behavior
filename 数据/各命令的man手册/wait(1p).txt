       When an asynchronous list (see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples) is started
       by the shell, the process ID of the last command in each element of
       the asynchronous list shall become known in the current shell
       execution environment; see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment.
       If the wait utility is invoked with no operands, it shall wait until
       all process IDs known to the invoking shell have terminated and exit
       with a zero exit status.
       If one or more pid operands are specified that represent known
       process IDs, the wait utility shall wait until all of them have
       terminated. If one or more pid operands are specified that represent
       unknown process IDs, wait shall treat them as if they were known
       process IDs that exited with exit status 127. The exit status
       returned by the wait utility shall be the exit status of the process
       requested by the last pid operand.
       The known process IDs are applicable only for invocations of wait in
       the current shell execution environment.
