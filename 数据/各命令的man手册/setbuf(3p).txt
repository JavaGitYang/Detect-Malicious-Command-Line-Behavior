       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       Except that it returns no value, the function call:
           setbuf(stream, buf)
       shall be equivalent to:
           setvbuf(stream, buf, _IOFBF, BUFSIZ)
       if buf is not a null pointer, or to:
           setvbuf(stream, buf, _IONBF, BUFSIZ)
       if buf is a null pointer.
