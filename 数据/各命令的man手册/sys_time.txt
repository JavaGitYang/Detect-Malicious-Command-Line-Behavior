       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the timeval structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:
           time_t         tv_sec      Seconds.
           suseconds_t    tv_usec     Microseconds.
       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the itimerval structure, which
       shall include at least the following members:
           struct timeval it_interval Timer interval.
           struct timeval it_value    Current value.
       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the time_t and suseconds_t types
       as described in <sys/types.h>.
       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the fd_set type as described in
       <sys/select.h>.
       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants
       for the which argument of getitimer() and setitimer():
       ITIMER_REAL   Decrements in real time.
       ITIMER_VIRTUAL
                     Decrements in process virtual time.
       ITIMER_PROF   Decrements both in process virtual time and when the
                     system is running on behalf of the process.
       The <sys/time.h> header shall define the following as described in
       <sys/select.h>: FD_CLR() FD_ISSET() FD_SET() FD_ZERO() FD_SETSIZE
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int   getitimer(int, struct itimerval *);
           int   gettimeofday(struct timeval *restrict, void *restrict);
           int   setitimer(int, const struct itimerval *restrict,
                     struct itimerval *restrict);
           int   select(int, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict, fd_set *restrict,
                     struct timeval *restrict);
           int   utimes(const char *, const struct timeval [2]);
       Inclusion of the <sys/time.h> header may make visible all symbols
       from the <sys/select.h> header.
       The following sections are informative.
