       This function will set the maximum size of the *unencrypted* records
       which will be sent over a DTLS session. It is equivalent to
       calculating the DTLS packet overhead with the current encryption
       parameters, and calling gnutls_dtls_set_mtu() with that value. In
       particular, this means that you may need to call this function again
       after any negotiation or renegotiation, in order to ensure that the
       MTU is still sufficient to account for the new protocol overhead.
       In most cases you only need to call gnutls_dtls_set_mtu() with the
       maximum MTU of your transport layer.
