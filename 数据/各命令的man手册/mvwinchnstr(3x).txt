       These routines return a NULL-terminated array of chtype quantities,
       starting at the current cursor position in the named window and
       ending at the right margin of the window.  The four functions with n
       as the last argument, return a leading substring at most n characters
       long (exclusive of the trailing (chtype)0).  Constants defined in
       <curses.h> can be used with the & (logical AND) operator to extract
       the character or the attribute alone from any position in the chstr
       [see curs_inch(3X)].
