       The pam_xauth_data structure contains X authentication data used to
       make a connection to an X display. Using this mechanism, an
       application can communicate X authentication data to PAM service
       modules. This allows modules to make a connection to the user's X
       display in order to label the user's session on login, display visual
       feedback or for other purposes.
       The name field contains the name of the authentication method, such
       as "MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1". The namelen field contains the length of
       this string, not including the trailing NUL character.
       The data field contains the authentication method-specific data
       corresponding to the specified name. The datalen field contains its
       length in bytes.
       The X authentication data can be changed with the PAM_XAUTH_DATA
       item. It can be queried and set with pam_get_item(3) and pam_set_item
       (3) respectively. The value used to set it should be a pointer to a
       pam_xauth_data structure. An internal copy of both the structure
       itself and its fields is made by PAM when setting the item.
