       pmdazswap is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values about compressed swap operation, as tracked by the
       zswap Linux kernel module.
       Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages.  It takes
       pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts to
       compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory pool.
       Zswap trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O.  This
       tradeoff can also result in a performance improvement if reads from
       the compressed cache are faster than reads from a swap device.
       This PMDA exports metrics about pool size, number of pages stored,
       and various counters for the reasons pages are rejected.
