       The pause() function shall suspend the calling thread until delivery
       of a signal whose action is either to execute a signal-catching
       function or to terminate the process.
       If the action is to terminate the process, pause() shall not return.
       If the action is to execute a signal-catching function, pause() shall
       return after the signal-catching function returns.
