       The bind_textdomain_codeset function sets the output codeset for
       message catalogs for domain domainname.
       A message domain is a set of translatable msgid messages. Usually,
       every software package has its own message domain.
       By default, the gettext family of functions returns translated
       messages in the locale's character encoding, which can be retrieved
       as nl_langinfo(CODESET). The need for calling bind_textdomain_codeset
       arises for programs which store strings in a locale independent way
       (e.g.  UTF-8) and want to avoid an extra character set conversion on
       the returned translated messages.
       domainname must be a non-empty string.
       If codeset is not NULL, it must be a valid encoding name which can be
       used for the iconv_open function. The bind_textdomain_codeset
       function sets the output codeset for message catalogs belonging to
       domain domainname to codeset. The function makes copies of the
       argument strings as needed.
       If codeset is NULL, the function returns the previously set codeset
       for domain domainname. The default is NULL, denoting the locale's
       character encoding.
