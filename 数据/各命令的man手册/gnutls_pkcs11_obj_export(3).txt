       This function will export the PKCS11 object data.  It is normal for
       data to be inaccesible and in that case GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST will
       be returned.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
       *output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned.
