       The system call vm86() was introduced in Linux 0.97p2.  In Linux
       2.1.15 and 2.0.28, it was renamed to vm86old(), and a new vm86() was
       introduced.  The definition of struct vm86_struct was changed in
       1.1.8 and 1.1.9.
       These calls cause the process to enter VM86 mode (virtual-8086 in
       Intel literature), and are used by dosemu.
       VM86 mode is an emulation of real mode within a protected mode task.
