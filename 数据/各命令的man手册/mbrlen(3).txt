       The mbrlen() function inspects at most n bytes of the multibyte
       string starting at s and extracts the next complete multibyte
       character.  It updates the shift state *ps.  If the multibyte
       character is not the null wide character, it returns the number of
       bytes that were consumed from s.  If the multibyte character is the
       null wide character, it resets the shift state *ps to the initial
       state and returns 0.
       If the n bytes starting at s do not contain a complete multibyte
       character, mbrlen() returns (size_t) -2.  This can happen even if n
       >= MB_CUR_MAX, if the multibyte string contains redundant shift
       sequences.
       If the multibyte string starting at s contains an invalid multibyte
       sequence before the next complete character, mbrlen() returns
       (size_t) -1 and sets errno to EILSEQ.  In this case, the effects on
       *ps are undefined.
       If ps is NULL, a static anonymous state known only to the mbrlen()
       function is used instead.
