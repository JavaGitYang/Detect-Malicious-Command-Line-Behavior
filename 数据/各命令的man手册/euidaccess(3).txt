       Like access(2), euidaccess() checks permissions and existence of the
       file identified by its argument pathname.  However, whereas access(2)
       performs checks using the real user and group identifiers of the
       process, euidaccess() uses the effective identifiers.
       mode is a mask consisting of one or more of R_OK, W_OK, X_OK, and
       F_OK, with the same meanings as for access(2).
       eaccess() is a synonym for euidaccess(), provided for compatibility
       with some other systems.
