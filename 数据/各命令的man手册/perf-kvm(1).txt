       There are a couple of variants of perf kvm:
           'perf kvm [options] top <command>' to generates and displays
           a performance counter profile of guest os in realtime
           of an arbitrary workload.
           'perf kvm record <command>' to record the performance counter profile
           of an arbitrary workload and save it into a perf data file. We set the
           default behavior of perf kvm as --guest, so if neither --host nor --guest
           is input, the perf data file name is perf.data.guest. If --host is input,
           the perf data file name is perf.data.kvm. If you want to record data into
           perf.data.host, please input --host --no-guest. The behaviors are shown as
           following:
             Default('')         ->  perf.data.guest
             --host              ->  perf.data.kvm
             --guest             ->  perf.data.guest
             --host --guest      ->  perf.data.kvm
             --host --no-guest   ->  perf.data.host
           'perf kvm report' to display the performance counter profile information
           recorded via perf kvm record.
           'perf kvm diff' to displays the performance difference amongst two perf.data
           files captured via perf record.
           'perf kvm buildid-list' to  display the buildids found in a perf data file,
           so that other tools can be used to fetch packages with matching symbol tables
           for use by perf report. As buildid is read from /sys/kernel/notes in os, then
           if you want to list the buildid for guest, please make sure your perf data file
           was captured with --guestmount in perf kvm record.
           'perf kvm stat <command>' to run a command and gather performance counter
           statistics.
           Especially, perf 'kvm stat record/report' generates a statistical analysis
           of KVM events. Currently, vmexit, mmio (x86 only) and ioport (x86 only)
           events are supported. 'perf kvm stat record <command>' records kvm events
           and the events between start and end <command>.
           And this command produces a file which contains tracing results of kvm
           events.
           'perf kvm stat report' reports statistical data which includes events
           handled time, samples, and so on.
           'perf kvm stat live' reports statistical data in a live mode (similar to
           record + report but with statistical data updated live at a given display
           rate).
