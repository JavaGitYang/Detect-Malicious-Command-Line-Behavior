       The iswxdigit() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isxdigit(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "xdigit".
       The wide-character class "xdigit" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alnum", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "graph" and of the wide-character class "print".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
       character class "xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
       character class "xdigit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "punct".
       The wide-character class "xdigit" always contains at least the
       letters 'A' to 'F', 'a' to 'f' and the digits '0' to '9'.
