       The SELinux policy can include conditional rules that are enabled or
       disabled based on the current values of a set of policy booleans.
       These policy booleans allow runtime modification of the security
       policy without having to load a new policy.
       The SELinux API allows for a transaction based update. So you can set
       several boolean values and then commit them all at once.
       security_load_booleans() loads policy boolean settings. Path may be
       NULL, in which case the booleans are loaded from the active policy
       boolean configuration file.
       security_get_boolean_names() provides a list of boolean names,
       currently supported by the loaded policy.
       security_get_boolean_pending() returns the pending value for boolean
       or -1 on failure.
       security_get_boolean_active() returns the active value for boolean or
       -1 on failure.
       security_set_boolean() sets the pending value for boolean
       security_set_boolean_list() saves a list of booleans in a single
       transaction.
       security_commit_booleans() commits all pending values for the
       booleans.
