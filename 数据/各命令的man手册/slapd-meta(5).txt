       The meta backend to slapd(8) performs basic LDAP proxying with
       respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets".  The
       information contained in these servers can be presented as belonging
       to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).
       A basic knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-ldap(5) backend
       is recommended.  This backend has been designed as an enhancement of
       the ldap backend.  The two backends share many features (actually
       they also share portions of code).  While the ldap backend is
       intended to proxy operations directed to a single server, the meta
       backend is mainly intended for proxying of multiple servers and
       possibly naming context masquerading.  These features, although
       useful in many scenarios, may result in excessive overhead for some
       applications, so its use should be carefully considered.  In the
       examples section, some typical scenarios will be discussed.
       The proxy instance of slapd(8) must contain schema information for
       the attributes and objectClasses used in filters, request DN and
       request-related data in general.  It should also contain schema
       information for the data returned by the proxied server.  It is the
       responsibility of the proxy administrator to keep the schema of the
       proxy lined up with that of the proxied server.
       Note: When looping back to the same instance of slapd(8), each
       connection requires a new thread; as a consequence, slapd(8) must be
       compiled with thread support, and the threads parameter may need some
       tuning; in those cases, unless the multiple target feature is
       required, one may consider using slapd-relay(5) instead, which
       performs the relayed operation internally and thus reuses the same
       connection.
