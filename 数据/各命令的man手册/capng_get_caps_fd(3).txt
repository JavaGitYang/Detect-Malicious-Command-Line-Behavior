       This function will read the file based capabilities stored in
       extended attributes of the file that the descriptor was opened
       against. The bounding set is not included in file based capabilities
       operations. Note that this function will only work if compiled on a
       kernel that supports file based capabilities such as 2.6.26 and
       later. If the "magic" bit is set, then all effect capability bits are
       set. Otherwise the bits are cleared.
