       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fclose() function shall cause the stream pointed to by stream to
       be flushed and the associated file to be closed. Any unwritten
       buffered data for the stream shall be written to the file; any unread
       buffered data shall be discarded. Whether or not the call succeeds,
       the stream shall be disassociated from the file and any buffer set by
       the setbuf() or setvbuf() function shall be disassociated from the
       stream. If the associated buffer was automatically allocated, it
       shall be deallocated.
       If the file is not already at EOF, and the file is one capable of
       seeking, the file offset of the underlying open file description
       shall be set to the file position of the stream if the stream is the
       active handle to the underlying file description.
       The fclose() function shall mark for update the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the underlying
       file, if the stream was writable, and if buffered data remains that
       has not yet been written to the file. The fclose() function shall
       perform the equivalent of a close() on the file descriptor that is
       associated with the stream pointed to by stream.
       After the call to fclose(), any use of stream results in undefined
       behavior.
