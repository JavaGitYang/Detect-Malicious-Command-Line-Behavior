       By default, the du utility shall write to standard output the size of
       the file space allocated to, and the size of the file space allocated
       to each subdirectory of, the file hierarchy rooted in each of the
       specified files. By default, when a symbolic link is encountered on
       the command line or in the file hierarchy, du shall count the size of
       the symbolic link (rather than the file referenced by the link), and
       shall not follow the link to another portion of the file hierarchy.
       The size of the file space allocated to a file of type directory
       shall be defined as the sum total of space allocated to all files in
       the file hierarchy rooted in the directory plus the space allocated
       to the directory itself.
       When du cannot stat() files or stat() or read directories, it shall
       report an error condition and the final exit status is affected.
       Files with multiple links shall be counted and written for only one
       entry. The directory entry that is selected in the report is
       unspecified. By default, file sizes shall be written in 512-byte
       units, rounded up to the next 512-byte unit.
