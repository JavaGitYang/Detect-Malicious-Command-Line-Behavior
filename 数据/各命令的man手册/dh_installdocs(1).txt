       dh_installdocs is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing documentation into usr/share/doc/package in package build
       directories.
       In compat 10 and earlier, dh_install(1) may be a better tool for
       handling the upstream documentation, when upstream's own build system
       installs all the desired documentation correctly.  In this case,
       dh_installdocs is still useful for installing packaging related
       documentation (e.g. the debian/copyright file).
       In compat 11 and later, dh_installdocs offers many of the features
       that dh_install(1) also have.  Furthermore, dh_installdocs also
       supports the nodoc build profile to exclude documentation (regardless
       of compat level).
