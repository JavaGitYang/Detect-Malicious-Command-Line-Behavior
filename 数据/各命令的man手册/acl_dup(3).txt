     The acl_dup() function returns a pointer to a copy of the ACL pointed
     to by acl.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‐
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_dup() as an argu‐
     ment.
