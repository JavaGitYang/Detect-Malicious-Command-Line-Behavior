       This command creates an empty Git repository - basically a .git
       directory with subdirectories for objects, refs/heads, refs/tags, and
       template files. An initial HEAD file that references the HEAD of the
       master branch is also created.
       If the $GIT_DIR environment variable is set then it specifies a path
       to use instead of ./.git for the base of the repository.
       If the object storage directory is specified via the
       $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY environment variable then the sha1 directories
       are created underneath - otherwise the default $GIT_DIR/objects
       directory is used.
       Running git init in an existing repository is safe. It will not
       overwrite things that are already there. The primary reason for
       rerunning git init is to pick up newly added templates (or to move
       the repository to another place if --separate-git-dir is given).
