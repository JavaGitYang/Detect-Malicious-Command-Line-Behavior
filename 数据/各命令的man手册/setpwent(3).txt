       The getpwent() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of a record from the password database (e.g.,
       the local password file /etc/passwd, NIS, and LDAP).  The first time
       getpwent() is called, it returns the first entry; thereafter, it
       returns successive entries.
       The setpwent() function rewinds to the beginning of the password
       database.
       The endpwent() function is used to close the password database after
       all processing has been performed.
       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:
           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* user information */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };
       For more information about the fields of this structure, see
       passwd(5).
