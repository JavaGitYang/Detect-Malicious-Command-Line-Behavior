       semodule_link is a developer tool for manually linking together a set
       of SELinux policy module packages into a single policy module
       package.  This tool is not necessary for normal operation of SELinux.
       In normal operation, such linking is performed internally by
       libsemanage in response to semodule commands.  Module packages are
       created by semodule_package.
