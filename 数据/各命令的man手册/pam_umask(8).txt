       pam_umask is a PAM module to set the file mode creation mask of the
       current environment. The umask affects the default permissions
       assigned to newly created files.
       The PAM module tries to get the umask value from the following places
       in the following order:
       路   umask= argument
       路   umask= entry in the user's GECOS field
       路   UMASK= entry from /etc/default/login
       路   UMASK entry from /etc/login.defs
       The GECOS field is split on comma ',' characters. The module also in
       addition to the umask= entry recognizes pri= entry, which sets the
       nice priority value for the session, and ulimit= entry, which sets
       the maximum size of files the processes in the session can create.
