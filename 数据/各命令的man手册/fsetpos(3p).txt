       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fsetpos() function shall set the file position and state
       indicators for the stream pointed to by stream according to the value
       of the object pointed to by pos, which the application shall ensure
       is a value obtained from an earlier call to fgetpos() on the same
       stream. If a read or write error occurs, the error indicator for the
       stream shall be set and fsetpos() fails.
       A successful call to the fsetpos() function shall clear the end-of-
       file indicator for the stream and undo any effects of ungetc() on the
       same stream. After an fsetpos() call, the next operation on an update
       stream may be either input or output.
       The behavior of fsetpos() on devices which are incapable of seeking
       is implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset associated
       with such a device is undefined.
       The fsetpos() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
