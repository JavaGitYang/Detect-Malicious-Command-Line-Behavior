       A collection of one or more Performance Co-Pilot (see PCPIntro(1))
       archive logs may be combined with mkaf to produce a PCP archive folio
       and the associated archive folio control file.  Some PCP tools use
       mkaf to create archive folios, e.g.  the ``record'' facility in the
       pmchart(1) and pmview(1) tools, to facilitate playback with pmafm(1).
       mkaf processes each filename argument, and if this is a component
       file from a PCP archive that archive is added to the folio.
       If filename is a directory, then this is searched recursively using
       find(1).  Any filename argument beginning with a ``-'' is assumed to
       be a find(1) command line option (findopts); the default is -follow
       if no findopts are specified.
       The first named archive in the folio is assumed to be associated with
       the default host for any tool that tries to replay multiple archives
       from the folio.
       The folio control file is written to standard output, and has the
       following format.
       1. The first line contains the word PCPFolio.
       2. The second line contains the tag Version: followed by the format
          version number (currently 1).
       3. For subsequent lines, blank lines and lines beginning with ``#''
          are ignored.
       4. The line beginning with the tag Created: documents where and when
          the folio was created.
       5. The line beginning with the tag Creator: identifies the tool which
          created the folio (and is assumed to know how to replay the
          archive folio).  If present, the second argument is the name of a
          configuration file that the creator tool could use to replay the
          archive folio, e.g. with the replay command for pmafm(1).  In the
          case of mkaf (unlike pmchart(1) or pmview(1)) there is no
          knowledge of the contents of the archives, so the ``creator''
          cannot replay the archive, however pmchart(1) is able to replay
          any archive, and so this tool is identified as the Creator: for
          archive folios created by mkaf(1).
       6. This is then followed by one or more lines beginning with the tag
          Archive: followed by the hostname and base name of the archive.
       For example
            $ mkaf mydir/gonzo
       might produce the following folio control file.
       PCPFolio
       Version: 1
