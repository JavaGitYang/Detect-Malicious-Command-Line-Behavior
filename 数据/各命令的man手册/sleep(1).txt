       Pause for NUMBER seconds.  SUFFIX may be 's' for seconds (the
       default), 'm' for minutes, 'h' for hours or 'd' for days.  Unlike
       most implementations that require NUMBER be an integer, here NUMBER
       may be an arbitrary floating point number.  Given two or more
       arguments, pause for the amount of time specified by the sum of their
       values.
