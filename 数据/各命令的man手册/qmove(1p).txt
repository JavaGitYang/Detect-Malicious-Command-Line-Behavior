       To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch queue
       in which it resides and instantiate the batch job in another batch
       queue.  A batch job is moved by a request to the batch server that
       manages the batch job. The qmove utility is a user-accessible batch
       client that requests the movement of one or more batch jobs.
       The qmove utility shall move those batch jobs, and only those batch
       jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.
       The qmove utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the
       corresponding batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.
       If the qmove utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qmove utility shall move batch jobs by sending a Move Job Request
       to the batch server that manages each batch job. The qmove utility
       shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding to all
       successfully processed batch job_identifiers have been moved.
