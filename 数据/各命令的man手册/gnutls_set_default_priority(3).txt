       Sets the default priority on the ciphers, key exchange methods, and
       macs. This is the recommended method of setting the defaults, in
       order to promote consistency between applications using GnuTLS, and
       to allow GnuTLS using applications to update settings in par with the
       library. For client applications which require maximum compatibility
       consider calling gnutls_session_enable_compatibility_mode() after
       this function.
       To allow a user to override the defaults (e.g., when a user interface
       or configuration file is available), the functions
       gnutls_priority_set_direct() or gnutls_priority_set() can be used.
