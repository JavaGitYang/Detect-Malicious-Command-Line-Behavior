       pcap_stats() fills in the struct pcap_stat pointed to by its second
       argument.  The values represent packet statistics from the start of
       the run to the time of the call.
       pcap_stats() is supported only on live captures, not on
       ``savefiles''; no statistics are stored in ``savefiles'', so no
       statistics are available when reading from a ``savefile''.
       A struct pcap_stat has the following members:
              ps_recv
                     number of packets received;
              ps_drop
                     number of packets dropped because there was no room in
                     the operating system's buffer when they arrived,
                     because packets weren't being read fast enough;
              ps_ifdrop
                     number of packets dropped by the network interface or
                     its driver.
       The statistics do not behave the same way on all platforms.  ps_recv
       might count packets whether they passed any filter set with
       pcap_setfilter(3PCAP) or not, or it might count only packets that
       pass the filter.  It also might, or might not, count packets dropped
       because there was no room in the operating system's buffer when they
       arrived.  ps_drop is not available on all platforms; it is zero on
       platforms where it's not available.  If packet filtering is done in
       libpcap, rather than in the operating system, it would count packets
       that don't pass the filter.  Both ps_recv and ps_drop might, or might
       not, count packets not yet read from the operating system and thus
       not yet seen by the application.  ps_ifdrop might, or might not, be
       implemented; if it's zero, that might mean that no packets were
       dropped by the interface, or it might mean that the statistic is
       unavailable, so it should not be treated as an indication that the
       interface did not drop any packets.
