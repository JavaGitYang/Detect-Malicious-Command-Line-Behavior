       Run the cmd application within a tightly confined SELinux domain.
       The default sandbox domain only allows applications the ability to
       read and write stdin, stdout and any other file descriptors handed to
       it. It is not allowed to open any other files.  The -M option will
       mount an alternate homedir and tmpdir to be used by the sandbox.
       If you have the policycoreutils-sandbox package installed, you can
       use the -X option and the -M option.  sandbox -X allows you to run X
       applications within a sandbox.  These applications will start up
       their own X Server and create a temporary home directory and /tmp.
       The default SELinux policy does not allow any capabilities or network
       access.  It also prevents all access to the users other processes and
       files.  Files specified on the command that are in the home directory
       or /tmp will be copied into the sandbox directories.
       If directories are specified with -H or -T the directory will have
       its context modified with chcon(1) unless a level is specified with
       -l.  If the MLS/MCS security level is specified, the user is
       responsible to set the correct labels.
       -h --help
              display usage message
       -H --homedir
              Use alternate homedir to mount over your home directory.
              Defaults to temporary. Requires -X or -M.
       -i --include
              Copy this file into the appropriate temporary sandbox
              directory. Command can be repeated.
       -I --includefile
              Copy all files listed in inputfile into the appropriate
              temporary sandbox directories.
       -l --level
              Specify the MLS/MCS Security Level to run the sandbox with.
              Defaults to random.
       -M --mount
              Create a Sandbox with temporary files for $HOME and /tmp.
       -s --shred
              Shred temporary files created in $HOME and /tmp, before
              deleting.
       -t --type
              Use alternate sandbox type, defaults to sandbox_t or
              sandbox_x_t for -X.
              Examples:
              sandbox_t -    No X, No Network Access, No Open, read/write on
              passed in file descriptors.
              sandbox_min_t  -    No Network Access
              sandbox_x_t    -    Ports for X applications to run locally
              sandbox_web_t  -    Ports required for web browsing
              sandbox_net_t  -         Network ports (for server software)
              sandbox_net_client_t     -    All network ports
       -T --tmpdir
              Use alternate temporary directory to mount on /tmp.  Defaults
              to tmpfs. Requires -X or -M.
       -S --session
              Run a full desktop session, Requires level, and home and
              tmpdir.
       -w --windowsize
              Specifies the windowsize when creating an X based Sandbox. The
              default windowsize is 1000x700.
       -W --windowmanager
              Select alternative window manager to run within sandbox -X.
              Default to /usr/bin/openbox.
       -X     Create an X based Sandbox for gui apps, temporary files for
              $HOME and /tmp, secondary Xserver, defaults to sandbox_x_t
       -d --dpi
              Set the DPI value for the sandbox X Server. Defaults to the
              current X Sever DPI.
       -C --capabilities Use capabilities within the
              sandbox. By default applications executed within the sandbox
              will not be allowed to use capabilities (setuid apps), with
              the -C flag, you can use programs requiring capabilities.
