       The strsignal() function shall map the signal number in signum to an
       implementation-defined string and shall return a pointer to it.  It
       shall use the same set of messages as the psignal() function.
       The application shall not modify the string returned. The returned
       pointer might be invalidated or the string content might be
       overwritten by a subsequent call to strsignal() or setlocale().
       The contents of the message strings returned by strsignal() should be
       determined by the setting of the LC_MESSAGES category in the current
       locale.
       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
       standard calls strsignal().
       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call strsignal(), then check errno.
       The strsignal() function need not be thread-safe.
