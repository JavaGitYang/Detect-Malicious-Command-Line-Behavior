       dh_strip is a debhelper program that is responsible for stripping
       executables, shared libraries, and static libraries that are not used
       for debugging.
       This program examines your package build directories and works out
       what to strip on its own. It uses file(1) and file permissions and
       filenames to figure out what files are shared libraries (*.so),
       executable binaries, and static (lib*.a) and debugging libraries
       (lib*_g.a, debug/*.so), and strips each as much as is possible.
       (Which is not at all for debugging libraries.) In general it seems to
       make very good guesses, and will do the right thing in almost all
       cases.
       Since it is very hard to automatically guess if a file is a module,
       and hard to determine how to strip a module, dh_strip does not
       currently deal with stripping binary modules such as .o files.
