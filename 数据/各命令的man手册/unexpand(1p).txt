       The unexpand utility shall copy files or standard input to standard
       output, converting <blank> characters at the beginning of each line
       into the maximum number of <tab> characters followed by the minimum
       number of <space> characters needed to fill the same column positions
       originally filled by the translated <blank> characters. By default,
       tabstops shall be set at every eighth column position. Each
       <backspace> shall be copied to the output, and shall cause the column
       position count for tab calculations to be decremented; the count
       shall never be decremented to a value less than one.
