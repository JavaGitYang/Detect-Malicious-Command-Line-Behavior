       This function sets the first argument of the transport functions,
       such as send() and recv() for the default callbacks using the
       system's socket API. With this function you can set two different
       descriptors for receiving and sending.
       This function is equivalent to calling gnutls_transport_set_ptr2()
       with the descriptors, but requires no casts.
