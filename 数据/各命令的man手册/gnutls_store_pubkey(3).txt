       This function will store the provided (raw or DER-encoded)
       certificate to the list of stored public keys. The key will be
       considered valid until the provided expiration time.
       The  store variable if non-null specifies a custom backend for the
       storage of entries. If it is NULL then the default file backend will
       be used.
       Unless an alternative  tdb is provided, the storage format is a
       textual format consisting of a line for each host with fields
       separated by '|'. The contents of the fields are a format-identifier
       which is set to 'g0', the hostname that the rest of the data applies
       to, the numeric port or host name, the expiration time in seconds
       since the epoch (0 for no expiration), and a base64 encoding of the
       raw (DER) public key information (SPKI) of the peer.
