       Complex numbers are numbers of the form z = a+b*i, where a and b are
       real numbers and i = sqrt(-1), so that i*i = -1.
       There are other ways to represent that number.  The pair (a,b) of
       real numbers may be viewed as a point in the plane, given by X- and
       Y-coordinates.  This same point may also be described by giving the
       pair of real numbers (r,phi), where r is the distance to the origin
       O, and phi the angle between the X-axis and the line Oz.  Now z =
       r*exp(i*phi) = r*(cos(phi)+i*sin(phi)).
       The basic operations are defined on z = a+b*i and w = c+d*i as:
       addition: z+w = (a+c) + (b+d)*i
       multiplication: z*w = (a*c - b*d) + (a*d + b*c)*i
       division: z/w = ((a*c + b*d)/(c*c + d*d)) + ((b*c - a*d)/(c*c +
       d*d))*i
       Nearly all math function have a complex counterpart but there are
       some complex-only functions.
