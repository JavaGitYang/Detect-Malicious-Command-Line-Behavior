       getfscreatecon() retrieves the context used for creating a new file
       system object.  This returned context should be freed with freecon(3)
       if non-NULL.  getfscreatecon() sets *con to NULL if no fscreate
       context has been explicitly set by the program (i.e. using the
       default policy behavior).
       setfscreatecon() sets the context used for creating a new file system
       object.  NULL can be passed to setfscreatecon() to reset to the
       default policy behavior.  The fscreate context is automatically reset
       after the next execve(2), so a program doesn't need to explicitly
       sanitize it upon startup.
       setfscreatecon() can be applied prior to library functions that
       internally perform an file creation, in order to set an file context
       on the objects.
       getfscreatecon_raw() and setfscreatecon_raw() behave identically to
       their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.
       Note: Signal handlers that perform a setfscreatecon() must take care
       to save, reset, and restore the fscreate context to avoid unexpected
       behavior.
       Note: Contexts are thread specific.
