       The automount program is used to manage mount points for autofs, the
       inlined Linux automounter.  automount works by reading the
       auto.master(5) map and sets up mount points for each entry in the
       master map allowing them to be automatically mounted when accessed.
       The file systems are then automatically umounted after a period of
       inactivity.
