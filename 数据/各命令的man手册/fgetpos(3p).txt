       The fgetpos() function shall store the current values of the parse
       state (if any) and file position indicator for the stream pointed to
       by stream in the object pointed to by pos.  The value stored contains
       unspecified information usable by fsetpos() for repositioning the
       stream to its position at the time of the call to fgetpos().
       The fgetpos() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
