       The pthread_getattr_np() function initializes the thread attributes
       object referred to by attr so that it contains actual attribute
       values describing the running thread thread.
       The returned attribute values may differ from the corresponding
       attribute values passed in the attr object that was used to create
       the thread using pthread_create(3).  In particular, the following
       attributes may differ:
       * the detach state, since a joinable thread may have detached itself
         after creation;
       * the stack size, which the implementation may align to a suitable
         boundary.
       * and the guard size, which the implementation may round upward to a
         multiple of the page size, or ignore (i.e., treat as 0), if the
         application is allocating its own stack.
       Furthermore, if the stack address attribute was not set in the thread
       attributes object used to create the thread, then the returned thread
       attributes object will report the actual stack address that the
       implementation selected for the thread.
       When the thread attributes object returned by pthread_getattr_np() is
       no longer required, it should be destroyed using
       pthread_attr_destroy(3).
