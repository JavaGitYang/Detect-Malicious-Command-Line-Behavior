       Slapadd is used to add entries specified in LDAP Directory
       Interchange Format (LDIF) to a slapd(8) database.  It opens the given
       database determined by the database number or suffix and adds entries
       corresponding to the provided LDIF to the database.  Databases
       configured as subordinate of this one are also updated, unless -g is
       specified.  The LDIF input is read from standard input or the
       specified file.
       All files eventually created by slapadd will belong to the identity
       slapadd is run as, so make sure you either run slapadd with the same
       identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in slapd(8)), or
       change file ownership before running slapd(8).
       Note: slapadd will also perform the relevant indexing whilst adding
       the database if any are configured. For specific details, please see
       slapindex(8).
