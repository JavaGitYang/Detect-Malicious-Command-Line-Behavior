       This function is the same as gnutls_record_recv(), except that it
       returns in addition to data, the sequence number of the data.  This
       is useful in DTLS where record packets might be received
       out-of-order. The returned 8-byte sequence number is an integer in
       big-endian format and should be treated as a unique message
       identification.
