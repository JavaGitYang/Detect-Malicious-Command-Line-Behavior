       mysqld, also known as MariaDB Server, is the main program that does
       most of the work in a MariaDB installation. MariaDB Server manages
       access to the MariaDB data directory that contains databases and
       tables. The data directory is also the default location for other
       information such as log files and status files.
       When MariaDB server starts, it listens for network connections from
       client programs and manages access to databases on behalf of those
       clients.
       The mysqld program has many options that can be specified at startup.
       For a complete list of options, run this command:
           shell> mysqld --verbose --help
       MariaDB Server also has a set of system variables that affect its
       operation as it runs. System variables can be set at server startup,
       and many of them can be changed at runtime to effect dynamic server
       reconfiguration. MariaDB Server also has a set of status variables
       that provide information about its operation. You can monitor these
       status variables to access runtime performance characteristics.
       For a full description of MariaDB Server command options, system
       variables, and status variables, see the MariaDB Knowledge Base.
