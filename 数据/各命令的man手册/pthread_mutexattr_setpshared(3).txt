       These functions get and set the process-shared attribute in a mutex
       attributes object.  This attribute must be appropriately set to
       ensure correct, efficient operation of a mutex created using this
       attributes object.
       The process-shared attribute can have one of the following values:
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE
              Mutexes created with this attributes object are to be shared
              only among threads in the same process that initialized the
              mutex.  This is the default value for the process-shared mutex
              attribute.
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED
              Mutexes created with this attributes object can be shared
              between any threads that have access to the memory containing
              the object, including threads in different processes.
       pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() places the value of the process-shared
       attribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by attr in the
       location pointed to by pshared.
       pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() sets the value of the process-shared
       attribute of the mutex attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in pshared.
       If attr does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object, the
       behavior is undefined.
