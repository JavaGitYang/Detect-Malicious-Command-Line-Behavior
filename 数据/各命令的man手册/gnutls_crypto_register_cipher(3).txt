       This function will register a cipher algorithm to be used by gnutls.
       Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and by
       convention kernel implemented algorithms have priority of 90 and
       CPU-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be
       used by gnutls.
       In the case the registered init or setkey functions return
       GNUTLS_E_NEED_FALLBACK, GnuTLS will attempt to use the next in
       priority registered cipher.
       The functions which are marked as non-AEAD they are not required when
       registering a cipher to be used with the new AEAD API introduced in
       GnuTLS 3.4.0. Internally GnuTLS uses the new AEAD API.
