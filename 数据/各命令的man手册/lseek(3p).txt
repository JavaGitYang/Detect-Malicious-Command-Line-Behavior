       The lseek() function shall set the file offset for the open file
       description associated with the file descriptor fildes, as follows:
        *  If whence is SEEK_SET, the file offset shall be set to offset
           bytes.
        *  If whence is SEEK_CUR, the file offset shall be set to its
           current location plus offset.
        *  If whence is SEEK_END, the file offset shall be set to the size
           of the file plus offset.
       The symbolic constants SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, and SEEK_END are defined
       in <unistd.h>.
       The behavior of lseek() on devices which are incapable of seeking is
       implementation-defined.  The value of the file offset associated with
       such a device is undefined.
       The lseek() function shall allow the file offset to be set beyond the
       end of the existing data in the file. If data is later written at
       this point, subsequent reads of data in the gap shall return bytes
       with the value 0 until data is actually written into the gap.
       The lseek() function shall not, by itself, extend the size of a file.
       If fildes refers to a shared memory object, the result of the lseek()
       function is unspecified.
       If fildes refers to a typed memory object, the result of the lseek()
       function is unspecified.
