       The blkrawverify utility can be used to verify data retrieved via
       blktrace. It will check for valid event formats, forward progressing
       sequence numbers and time stamps, also does reasonable checks for
       other potential issues within individual events.
       Errors found will be tracked in <dev>.verify.out.
