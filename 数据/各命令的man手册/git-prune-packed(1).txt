       This program searches the $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY for all objects that
       currently exist in a pack file as well as the independent object
       directories.
       All such extra objects are removed.
       A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with
       delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an
       associated index file.
       Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines,
       disk storage, etc.
