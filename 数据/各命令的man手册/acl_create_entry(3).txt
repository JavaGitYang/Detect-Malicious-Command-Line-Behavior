     The acl_create_entry() function creates a new ACL entry in the ACL
     pointed to by the contents of the pointer argument acl_p.  On success,
     the function returns a descriptor for the new ACL entry via entry_p.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‐
     ing acl_free(3) with (void*)*acl_p as an argument.  If the ACL working
     storage cannot be increased in the current location, then the working
     storage for the ACL pointed to by acl_p may be relocated and the previ‐
     ous working storage is released. A pointer to the new working storage
     is returned via acl_p.
     The components of the new ACL entry are initialized in the following
     ways: the ACL tag type component contains ACL_UNDEFINED_TAG, the quali‐
     fier component contains ACL_UNDEFINED_ID, and the set of permissions
     has no permissions enabled. Any existing ACL entry descriptors that
     refer to entries in the ACL continue to refer to those entries.
