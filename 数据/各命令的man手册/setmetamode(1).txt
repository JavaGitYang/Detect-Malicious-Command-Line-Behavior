       Without argument, setmetamode prints the current Meta key mode.  With
       argument, it sets the Meta key mode as indicated.  The setting before
       and after the change are reported.
       The Meta key mode is specific for each VT (and the VT corresponding
       to stdin is used).  One might use setmetamode in /etc/rc to define
       the initial state of the Meta key mode, e.g. by
            INITTY=/dev/tty[1-8]
            for tty in $INITTY; do
                 setmetamode escprefix < $tty
            done
