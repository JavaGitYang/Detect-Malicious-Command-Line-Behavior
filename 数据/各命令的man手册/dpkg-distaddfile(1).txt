       dpkg-distaddfile adds an entry for a named file to debian/files.
       It takes three non-option arguments, the filename and the section and
       priority for the .changes file.
       The filename should be specified relative to the directory where
       dpkg-genchanges will expect to find the files, usually .., rather
       than being a pathname relative to the current directory when
       dpkg-distaddfile is run.
