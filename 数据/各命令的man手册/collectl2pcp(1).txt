       collectl2pcp reads raw collectl(1) data from each file and creates a
       new PCP archive with basename archive.  Each input file may be
       gzipped (with .gz suffix).  The PCP archive and at least one input
       file are required arguments.
       The options to collectl2pcp are as follows.
       -F     Overwrite archive (and the index and meta files) if it already
              exists.
       -v     Report progress and errors verbosely.  This also reports a
              count of unsupported metric data in the collectl(1) input
              file(s), which is normally silently skipped.
       file [file ...]
              These are the collectl(1) input files.  If more than one is
              given, they must contain data for the same host and be given
              in time-stamp chronological order on the command line.  Note
              that when collectl(1) is run as a service, it normally creates
              files with date based names that will sort chronologically
              (e.g. /var/log/collectl/*.gz will be sorted correctly).
