       The newuidmap sets /proc/[pid]/uid_map based on its command line
       arguments and the uids allowed in /etc/subuid. Note that the root
       user is not exempted from the requirement for a valid /etc/subuid
       entry.
       After the pid argument, newuidmap expects sets of 3 integers:
       uid
           Beginning of the range of UIDs inside the user namespace.
       loweruid
           Beginning of the range of UIDs outside the user namespace.
       count
           Length of the ranges (both inside and outside the user
           namespace).
       newuidmap verifies that the caller is the owner of the process
       indicated by pid and that for each of the above sets, each of the
       UIDs in the range [loweruid, loweruid+count] is allowed to the caller
       according to /etc/subuid before setting /proc/[pid]/uid_map.
       Note that newuidmap may be used only once for a given process.
