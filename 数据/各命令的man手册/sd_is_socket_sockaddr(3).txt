       sd_is_fifo() may be called to check whether the specified file
       descriptor refers to a FIFO or pipe. If the path parameter is not
       NULL, it is checked whether the FIFO is bound to the specified file
       system path.
       sd_is_socket() may be called to check whether the specified file
       descriptor refers to a socket. If the family parameter is not
       AF_UNSPEC, it is checked whether the socket is of the specified
       family (AF_UNIX, AF_INET, ...). If the type parameter is not 0, it is
       checked whether the socket is of the specified type (SOCK_STREAM,
       SOCK_DGRAM, ...). If the listening parameter is positive, it is
       checked whether the socket is in accepting mode, i.e.  listen() has
       been called for it. If listening is 0, it is checked whether the
       socket is not in this mode. If the parameter is negative, no such
       check is made. The listening parameter should only be used for stream
       sockets and should be set to a negative value otherwise.
       sd_is_socket_inet() is similar to sd_is_socket(), but optionally
       checks the IPv4 or IPv6 port number the socket is bound to, unless
       port is zero. For this call family must be passed as either
       AF_UNSPEC, AF_INET, or AF_INET6.
       sd_is_socket_sockaddr() is similar to sd_is_socket_inet(), but checks
       if the socket is bound to the address specified by addr. The family
       specified by addr must be either AF_INET or AF_INET6 and addr_len
       must be large enough for that family. If addr specifies a non-zero
       port, it is also checked if the socket is bound to this port. In
       addition, for IPv6, if addr specifies non-zero sin6_flowinfo or
       sin6_scope_id, it is checked if the socket has the same values.
       sd_is_socket_unix() is similar to sd_is_socket() but optionally
       checks the AF_UNIX path the socket is bound to, unless the path
       parameter is NULL. For normal file system AF_UNIX sockets, set the
       length parameter to 0. For Linux abstract namespace sockets, set the
       length to the size of the address, including the initial 0 byte, and
       set the path to the initial 0 byte of the socket address.
       sd_is_mq() may be called to check whether the specified file
       descriptor refers to a POSIX message queue. If the path parameter is
       not NULL, it is checked whether the message queue is bound to the
       specified name.
       sd_is_special() may be called to check whether the specified file
       descriptor refers to a special file. If the path parameter is not
       NULL, it is checked whether the file descriptor is bound to the
       specified file name. Special files in this context are character
       device nodes and files in /proc or /sys.
