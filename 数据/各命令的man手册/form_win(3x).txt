       Every form has an associated pair of curses windows.  The form window
       displays any title and border associated with the window; the form
       subwindow displays the items of the form that are currently available
       for selection.
       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is not
       necessary to set either window; by default, the driver code uses
       stdscr for both.
       In the set_ functions, window argument of NULL is treated as though
       it were stsdcr.  A form argument of NULL is treated as a request to
       change the system default form window or subwindow.
       The function scale_form returns the minimum size required for the
       subwindow of form.
