       Summarizes git log output in a format suitable for inclusion in
       release announcements. Each commit will be grouped by author and
       title.
       Additionally, "[PATCH]" will be stripped from the commit description.
       If no revisions are passed on the command line and either standard
       input is not a terminal or there is no current branch, git shortlog
       will output a summary of the log read from standard input, without
       reference to the current repository.
