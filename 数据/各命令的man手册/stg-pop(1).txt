       Pop the topmost patch or a range of patches from the stack. The
       command fails if there are conflicts or local changes (and --keep was
       not specified).
       A series of pop and push operations are performed so that only the
       patches passed on the command line are popped from the stack. Some of
       the push operations may fail because of conflicts ("stg undo" would
       revert the last push operation).
