       With no options and no COMMAND or GUIDE given, the synopsis of the
       git command and a list of the most commonly used Git commands are
       printed on the standard output.
       If the option --all or -a is given, all available commands are
       printed on the standard output.
       If the option --guide or -g is given, a list of the useful Git guides
       is also printed on the standard output.
       If a command, or a guide, is given, a manual page for that command or
       guide is brought up. The man program is used by default for this
       purpose, but this can be overridden by other options or configuration
       variables.
       Note that git --help ... is identical to git help ... because the
       former is internally converted into the latter.
       To display the git(1) man page, use git help git.
       This page can be displayed with git help help or git help --help
