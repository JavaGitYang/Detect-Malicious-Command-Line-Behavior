       This module maintains a count of attempted accesses, can reset count
       on success, can deny access if too many attempts fail.
       pam_tally has several limitations, which are solved with pam_tally2.
       For this reason pam_tally is deprecated and will be removed in a
       future release.
       pam_tally comes in two parts: pam_tally.so and pam_tally. The former
       is the PAM module and the latter, a stand-alone program.  pam_tally
       is an (optional) application which can be used to interrogate and
       manipulate the counter file. It can display user counts, set
       individual counts, or clear all counts. Setting artificially high
       counts may be useful for blocking users without changing their
       passwords. For example, one might find it useful to clear all counts
       every midnight from a cron job. The faillog(8) command can be used
       instead of pam_tally to to maintain the counter file.
       Normally, failed attempts to access root will not cause the root
       account to become blocked, to prevent denial-of-service: if your
       users aren't given shell accounts and root may only login via su or
       at the machine console (not telnet/rsh, etc), this is safe.
