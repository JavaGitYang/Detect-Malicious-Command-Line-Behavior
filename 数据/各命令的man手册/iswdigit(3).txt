       The iswdigit() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isdigit(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "digit".
       The wide-character class "digit" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "xdigit", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-
       character class "print".
       Being a subclass of the wide character class "print", the wide-
       character class "digit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "digit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
       character class "digit" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "punct".
       The wide-character class "digit" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "alpha" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses
       "lower", "upper".
       The wide-character class "digit" always contains exactly the digits
       '0' to '9'.
