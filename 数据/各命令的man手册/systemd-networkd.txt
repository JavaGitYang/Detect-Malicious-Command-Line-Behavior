       systemd-networkd is a system service that manages networks. It
       detects and configures network devices as they appear, as well as
       creating virtual network devices.
       To configure low-level link settings independently of networks, see
       systemd.link(5).
       Network configurations applied before networkd is started are not
       removed, and static configuration applied by networkd is not removed
       when networkd exits. Dynamic configuration applied by networkd may
       also optionally be left in place on shutdown. This ensures restarting
       networkd does not cut the network connection, and, in particular,
       that it is safe to transition between the initrd and the real root,
       and back.
