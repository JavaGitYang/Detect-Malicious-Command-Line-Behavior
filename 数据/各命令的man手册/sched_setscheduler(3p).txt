       The sched_setscheduler() function shall set the scheduling policy and
       scheduling parameters of the process specified by pid to policy and
       the parameters specified in the sched_param structure pointed to by
       param, respectively. The value of the sched_priority member in the
       sched_param structure shall be any integer within the inclusive
       priority range for the scheduling policy specified by policy.  If the
       value of pid is negative, the behavior of the sched_setscheduler()
       function is unspecified.
       The possible values for the policy parameter are defined in the
       <sched.h> header.
       If a process specified by pid exists, and if the calling process has
       permission, the scheduling policy and scheduling parameters shall be
       set for the process whose process ID is equal to pid.
       If pid is zero, the scheduling policy and scheduling parameters shall
       be set for the calling process.
       The conditions under which one process has appropriate privileges to
       change the scheduling parameters of another process are
       implementation-defined.
       Implementations may require that the requesting process have
       permission to set its own scheduling parameters or those of another
       process.  Additionally, implementation-defined restrictions may apply
       as to the appropriate privileges required to set the scheduling
       policy of the process, or the scheduling policy of another process,
       to a particular value.
       The sched_setscheduler() function shall be considered successful if
       it succeeds in setting the scheduling policy and scheduling
       parameters of the process specified by pid to the values specified by
       policy and the structure pointed to by param, respectively.
       See Scheduling Policies for a description on how this function
       affects the scheduling of the threads within the target process.
       If the current scheduling policy for the target process is not
       SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, or SCHED_SPORADIC, the result is
       implementation-defined; this case includes the SCHED_OTHER policy.
       The specified sched_ss_repl_period shall be greater than or equal to
       the specified sched_ss_init_budget for the function to succeed; if it
       is not, then the function shall fail.
       The value of sched_ss_max_repl shall be within the inclusive range
       [1,{SS_REPL_MAX}] for the function to succeed; if not, the function
       shall fail. It is unspecified whether the sched_ss_repl_period and
       sched_ss_init_budget values are stored as provided by this function
       or are rounded to align with the resolution of the clock being used.
       This function is not atomic with respect to other threads in the
       process. Threads may continue to execute while this function call is
       in the process of changing the scheduling policy and associated
       scheduling parameters for the underlying kernel-scheduled entities
       used by the process contention scope threads.
