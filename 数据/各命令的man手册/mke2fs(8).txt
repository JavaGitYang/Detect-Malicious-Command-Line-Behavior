       mke2fs is used to create an ext2, ext3, or ext4 filesystem, usually
       in a disk partition (or file) named by device.
       The file system size is specified by fs-size.  If fs-size does not
       have a suffix, it is interpreted as power-of-two kilobytes, unless
       the -b blocksize option is specified, in which case fs-size is
       interpreted as the number of blocksize blocks.   If the fs-size is
       suffixed by 'k', 'm', 'g', 't' (either upper-case or lower-case),
       then it is interpreted in power-of-two kilobytes, megabytes,
       gigabytes, terabytes, etc.  If fs-size is omitted, mke2fs will create
       the file system based on the device size.
       If mke2fs is run as mkfs.XXX (i.e., mkfs.ext2, mkfs.ext3, or
       mkfs.ext4) the option -t XXX is implied; so mkfs.ext3 will create a
       file system for use with ext3, mkfs.ext4 will create a file system
       for use with ext4, and so on.
       The defaults of the parameters for the newly created filesystem, if
       not overridden by the options listed below, are controlled by the
       /etc/mke2fs.conf configuration file.  See the mke2fs.conf(5) manual
       page for more details.
