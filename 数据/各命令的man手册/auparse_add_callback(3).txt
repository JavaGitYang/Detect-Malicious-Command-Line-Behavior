       auparse_add_callback adds a callback function to the parse state
       which is invoked to notify the application of parsing events. This is
       part of the event feed API.
       The signature of the callback is:
       void
       auparse_callback(auparse_state_t *au, auparse_cb_event_t cb_event_type,
                        void *user_data);
       When the callback is invoked it is passed:
       au
               a pointer to the parse_state
       cb_event_type
              enumerated value indicating the reason why the callback was
              invoked
       user_data
              pointer to user supplied private data. May be NULL.
       user_destroy_func
              pointer to function called when user_data is destroyed. May be
              NULL.  The signature is:
              void destroy(void *user_data);
              The destroy() function should be prepared to accept user_data
              possibly being NULL.
       The cb_event_type argument indicates why the callback was invoked.
       It's possible values are:
       AUPARSE_CB_EVENT_READY
              A complete event has been parsed and is ready to be examined.
              This is logically equivalent to the parse state immediately
              following auparse_next_event()
       See auparse_feed(3) for a complete code example.
