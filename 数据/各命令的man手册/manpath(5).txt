       The manpath configuration file is used by the manual page utilities
       to assess users' manpaths at run time, to indicate which manual page
       hierarchies (manpaths) are to be treated as system hierarchies and to
       assign them directories to be used for storing cat files.
       If the environment variable $MANPATH is already set, the information
       contained within /usr/local/etc/man_db.conf will not override it.
