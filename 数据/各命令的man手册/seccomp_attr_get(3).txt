       The seccomp_attr_set() function sets the different seccomp filter
       attributes while the seccomp_attr_get() function fetches the filter
       attributes.  The seccomp filter attributes are tunable values that
       affect how the library behaves when generating and loading the
       seccomp filter into the kernel.  The attributes are reset to their
       default values whenever the filter is initialized or reset via
       seccomp_filter_init(3) or seccomp_filter_reset(3).
       The filter context ctx is the value returned by the call to
       seccomp_init(3).
       Valid attr values are as follows:
       SCMP_FLTATR_ACT_DEFAULT
              The default filter action as specified in the call to
              seccomp_filter_init(3) or seccomp_filter_reset(3).  This
              attribute is read-only.
       SCMP_FLTATR_ACT_BADARCH
              The filter action taken when the loaded filter does not match
              the architecture of the executing application.  Defaults to
              the SCMP_ACT_KILL action.
       SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_NNP
              A flag to specify if the NO_NEW_PRIVS functionality should be
              enabled before loading the seccomp filter into the kernel.
              Setting this to off ( value == 0) results in no action,
              meaning that loading the seccomp filter into the kernel will
              fail if CAP_SYS_ADMIN is missing and NO_NEW_PRIVS has not been
              externally set.  Defaults to on ( value == 1).
       SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC
              A flag to specify if the kernel should attempt to synchronize
              the filters across all threads on seccomp_load(3).  If the
              kernel is unable to synchronize all of the thread then the
              load operation will fail.  This flag is only available on
              Linux Kernel 3.17 or greater; attempting to enable this flag
              on earlier kernels will result in an error being returned.
              Defaults to off ( value == 0).
       SCMP_FLTATR_API_TSKIP
              A flag to specify if libseccomp should allow filter rules to
              be created for the -1 syscall.  The -1 syscall value can be
              used by tracer programs to skip specific syscall invocations,
              see seccomp(2) for more information.  Defaults to off ( value
              == 0).
       SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_LOG
              A flag to specify if the kernel should log all filter actions
              taken except for the SCMP_ACT_ALLOW action. Defaults to off (
              value == 0).
