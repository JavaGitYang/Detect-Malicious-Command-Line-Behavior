       NetEm is an enhancement of the Linux traffic control facilities that
       allow to add delay, packet loss, duplication and more other
       characteristics to packets outgoing from a selected network
       interface. NetEm is built using the existing Quality Of Service (QOS)
       and Differentiated Services (diffserv) facilities in the Linux
       kernel.
