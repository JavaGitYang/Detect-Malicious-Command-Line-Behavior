       This is the function where you set a function for gnutls to receive
       data.  Normally, if you use berkeley style sockets, do not need to
       use this function since the default recv(2) will probably be ok.  The
       callback should return 0 on connection termination, a positive number
       indicating the number of bytes received, and -1 on error.
        gnutls_pull_func is of the form, ssize_t
       (*gnutls_pull_func)(gnutls_transport_ptr_t, void*, size_t);
