       ldapurl is a command that allows one to either compose or decompose
       LDAP URIs.
       When invoked with the -H option, ldapurl extracts the components of
       the ldapuri option argument, unescaping hex-escaped chars as
       required.  It basically acts as a frontend to the ldap_url_parse(3)
       call.  Otherwise, it builds an LDAP URI based on the components
       passed with the appropriate options, performing the inverse
       operation.  Option -H is incompatible with options -a, -b, -E, -f,
       -H, -h, -p, -S, and -s.
