       xfs_logprint prints the log of an XFS filesystem (see xfs(5)).  The
       device argument is the pathname of the partition or logical volume
       containing the filesystem. The device can be a regular file if the -f
       option is used. The contents of the filesystem remain undisturbed.
       There are two major modes of operation in xfs_logprint.
       One mode is better for filesystem operation debugging.  It is called
       the transactional view and is enabled through the -t option. The
       transactional view prints only the portion of the log that pertains
       to recovery. In other words, it prints out complete transactions
       between the tail and the head. This view tries to display each
       transaction without regard to how they are split across log records.
       The second mode starts printing out information from the beginning of
       the log.  Some error blocks might print out in the beginning because
       the last log record usually overlaps the oldest log record. A message
       is printed when the physical end of the log is reached and when the
       logical end of the log is reached. A log record view is displayed one
       record at a time. Transactions that span log records may not be
       decoded fully.
