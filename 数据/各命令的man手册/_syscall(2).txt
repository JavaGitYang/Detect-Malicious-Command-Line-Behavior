       The important thing to know about a system call is its prototype.
       You need to know how many arguments, their types, and the function
       return type.  There are seven macros that make the actual call into
       the system easier.  They have the form:
           _syscallX(type,name,type1,arg1,type2,arg2,...)
       where
              X is 0–6, which are the number of arguments taken by the sys‐
              tem call
              type is the return type of the system call
              name is the name of the system call
              typeN is the Nth argument's type
              argN is the name of the Nth argument
       These macros create a function called name with the arguments you
       specify.  Once you include the _syscall() in your source file, you
       call the system call by name.
