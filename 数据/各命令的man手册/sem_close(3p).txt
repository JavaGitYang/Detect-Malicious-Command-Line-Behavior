       The sem_close() function shall indicate that the calling process is
       finished using the named semaphore indicated by sem.  The effects of
       calling sem_close() for an unnamed semaphore (one created by
       sem_init()) are undefined. The sem_close() function shall deallocate
       (that is, make available for reuse by a subsequent sem_open() by this
       process) any system resources allocated by the system for use by this
       process for this semaphore. The effect of subsequent use of the
       semaphore indicated by sem by this process is undefined. If the
       semaphore has not been removed with a successful call to
       sem_unlink(), then sem_close() has no effect on the state of the
       semaphore. If the sem_unlink() function has been successfully invoked
       for name after the most recent call to sem_open() with O_CREAT for
       this semaphore, then when all processes that have opened the
       semaphore close it, the semaphore is no longer accessible.
