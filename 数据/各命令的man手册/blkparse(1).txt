       The blkparse utility will attempt to combine streams of events for
       various devices on various CPUs, and produce a formatted output of
       the event information.  Specifically, it will take the (machine-
       readable) output of the blktrace utility and convert it to a nicely
       formatted and human-readable form.
       As with blktrace, some details concerning blkparse will help in
       understanding the command line options presented below.
       - By default, blkparse expects to run in a post-processing mode; one
         where the trace events have been saved by a previous run of
         blktrace, and blkparse is combining event streams and dumping
         formatted data.
         blkparse may be run in a live manner concurrently with blktrace by
         specifying -i - to blkparse, and combining it with the live option
         for blktrace.  An example would be:
            % blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -
       - You can set how many blkparse batches event reads via the -b
         option, the default is to handle events in batches of 512.
       - If you have saved event traces in blktrace with different output
         names (via the -o option to blktrace), you must specify the same
         input name via the -i option.
       - The format of the output data can be controlled via the -f or -F
         options -- see OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING for details.
       By default, blkparse sends formatted data to standard output. This
       may be changed via the -o option, or text output can be disabled via
       the -O option. A merged binary stream can be produced using the -d
       option.
