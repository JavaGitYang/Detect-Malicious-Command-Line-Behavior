       The mysql_client_test program is used for testing aspects of the
       MariaDB client API that cannot be tested using mysqltest and its test
       language.  mysql_client_test_embedded is similar but used for testing
       the embedded server. Both programs are run as part of the test suite.
       The source code for the programs can be found in in
       tests/mysql_client_test.c in a source distribution. The program
       serves as a good source of examples illustrating how to use various
       features of the client API.
       mysql_client_test is used in a test by the same name in the main
       tests suite of mysql-test-run.pl but may also be run directly. Unlike
       the other programs listed here, it does not read an external
       description of what tests to run. Instead, all tests are coded into
       the program, which is written to cover all aspects of the C language
       API.
       mysql_client_test supports the following options:
       ·   --help, -?
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --basedir=dir_name, -b dir_name
           The base directory for the tests.
       ·   --count=count, -t count
           The number of times to execute the tests.
       ·   --database=db_name, -D db_name
           The database to use.
       ·   --debug[=debug_options], -#[debug_options]
           Write a debugging log if MariaDB is built with debugging support.
           The default debug_options value is
           ´d:t:o,/tmp/mysql_client_test.trace´.
       ·   --getopt-ll-test=option, -g option
           Option to use for testing bugs in the getopt library.
       ·   --host=host_name, -h host_name
           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.
       ·   --password[=password], -p[password]
           The password to use when connecting to the server. If you use the
           short option form (-p), you cannot have a space between the
           option and the password. If you omit the password value following
           the --password or -p option on the command line, you are prompted
           for one.
       ·   --port=port_num, -P port_num
           The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.
       ·   --server-arg=arg, -A arg
           Argument to send to the embedded server.
       ·   --show-tests, -T
           Show all test names.
       ·   --silent, -s
           Be more silent.
       ·   --socket=path, -S path
           The socket file to use when connecting to localhost (which is the
           default host).
       ·   --testcase, -c
           The option is used when called from mysql-test-run.pl, so that
           mysql_client_test may optionally behave in a different way than
           if called manually, for example by skipping some tests.
           Currently, there is no difference in behavior but the option is
           included in order to make this possible.
       ·   --user=user_name, -u user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
       ·   -v dir_name, --vardir=dir_name
           The data directory for tests. The default is mysql-test/var.
