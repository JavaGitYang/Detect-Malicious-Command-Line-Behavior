       The uselocale() function sets the current locale for the calling
       thread, and returns the thread's previously current locale.  After a
       successful call to uselocale(), any calls by this thread to functions
       that depend on the locale will operate as though the locale has been
       set to newloc.
       The newloc argument can have one of the following values:
       A handle returned by a call to newlocale(3) or duplocale(3)
              The calling thread's current locale is set to the specified
              locale.
       The special locale object handle LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
              The calling thread's current locale is set to the global
              locale determined by setlocale(3).
       (locale_t) 0
              The calling thread's current locale is left unchanged (and the
              current locale is returned as the function result).
