       readelf displays information about one or more ELF format object
       files.  The options control what particular information to display.
       elffile... are the object files to be examined.  32-bit and 64-bit
       ELF files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.
       This program performs a similar function to objdump but it goes into
       more detail and it exists independently of the BFD library, so if
       there is a bug in BFD then readelf will not be affected.
