       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The islessgreater() macro shall determine whether its first argument
       is less than or greater than its second argument. The
       islessgreater(x, y) macro is similar to (x) < (y) || (x) > (y);
       however, islessgreater(x, y) shall not raise the invalid floating-
       point exception when x and y are unordered (nor shall it evaluate x
       and y twice).
