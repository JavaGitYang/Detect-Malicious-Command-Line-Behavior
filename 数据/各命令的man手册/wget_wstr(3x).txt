       The effect of get_wstr is as though a series of calls to get_wch(3X)
       were made, until a newline, other end-of-line, or end-of-file
       condition is processed.  An end-of-file condition is represented by
       WEOF, as defined in <wchar.h>.  The newline and end-of-line
       conditions are represented by the \n wchar_t value.  In all
       instances, the end of the string is terminated by a null wchar_t.
       The routine places resulting values in the area pointed to by wstr.
       The user's erase and kill characters are interpreted.  If keypad mode
       is on for the window, KEY_LEFT and KEY_BACKSPACE are both considered
       equivalent to the user's kill character.
       Characters input are echoed only if echo is currently on.  In that
       case, backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous character
       (typically a left motion).
       The effect of wget_wstr is as though a series of calls to wget_wch
       were made.
       The effect of mvget_wstr is as though a call to move and then a
       series of calls to get_wch were made.
       The effect of mvwget_wstr is as though a call to wmove and then a
       series of calls to wget_wch were made.
       The getn_wstr, mvgetn_wstr, mvwgetn_wstr, and wgetn_wstr functions
       are identical to the get_wstr, mvget_wstr, mvwget_wstr, and wget_wstr
       functions, respectively, except that the *n_* versions read at most n
       characters, letting the application prevent overflow of the input
       buffer.
