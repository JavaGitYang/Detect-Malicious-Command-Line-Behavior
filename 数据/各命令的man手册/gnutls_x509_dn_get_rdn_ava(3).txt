       Get pointers to data within the DN. The format of the  ava structure
       is shown below.
       struct gnutls_x509_ava_st { gnutls_datum_t oid; gnutls_datum_t value;
       unsigned long value_tag; };
       The X.509 distinguished name is a sequence of sequences of strings
       and this is what the  irdn and  iava indexes model.
       Note that  ava will contain pointers into the  dn structure which in
       turns points to the original certificate. Thus you should not modify
       any data or deallocate any of those.
       This is a low-level function that requires the caller to do the value
       conversions when necessary (e.g. from UCS-2).
