       The pthread_sigqueue() function performs a similar task to
       sigqueue(3), but, rather than sending a signal to a process, it sends
       a signal to a thread in the same process as the calling thread.
       The thread argument is the ID of a thread in the same process as the
       caller.  The sig argument specifies the signal to be sent.  The value
       argument specifies data to accompany the signal; see sigqueue(3) for
       details.
