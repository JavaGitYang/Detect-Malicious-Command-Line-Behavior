       The div() function shall compute the quotient and remainder of the
       division of the numerator numer by the denominator denom.  If the
       division is inexact, the resulting quotient is the integer of lesser
       magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If the
       result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined; otherwise,
       quot*denom+rem shall equal numer.
