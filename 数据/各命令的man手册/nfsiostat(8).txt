       The nfsiostat command displays NFS client per-mount statisitics.
       <interval>
              specifies the amount of time in seconds between each report.
              The first report contains statistics for the time since each
              file system was mounted.  Each subsequent report contains
              statistics collected during the interval since the previous
              report.
       <count>
              If the <count> parameter is specified, the value of <count>
              determines the number of reports generated at <interval>
              seconds apart. if the interval parameter is specified without
              the <count> parameter, the command generates reports
              continuously.
       <options>
              Define below
       <mount_point>
              If one or more <mount point> names are specified, statistics
              for only these mount points will be displayed.  Otherwise, all
              NFS mount points on the client are listed.
       The meaning of each column of nfsiostat's output is the following:
               - op/s
                      This is the number of operations per second.
               - rpc bklog
                      This is the length of the backlog queue.
               - kB/s
                      This is the number of kB written/read per second.
               - kB/op
                      This is the number of kB written/read per each
                      operation.
               - retrans
                      This is the number of retransmissions.
               - avg RTT (ms)
                      This is the duration from the time that client's
                      kernel sends the RPC request until the time it
                      receives the reply.
               - avg exe (ms)
                      This is the duration from the time that NFS client
                      does the RPC request to its kernel until the RPC
                      request is completed, this includes the RTT time
                      above.
               - avg queue (ms)
                      This is the duration from the time the NFS client
                      created the RPC request task to the time the request
                      is transmitted.
       Note that if an interval is used as argument to nfsiostat, then the
       diffrence from previous interval will be displayed, otherwise the
       results will be from the time that the share was mounted.
