       The monitor backend to slapd(8) is not an actual database; if
       enabled, it is automatically generated and dynamically maintained by
       slapd with information about the running status of the daemon.
       To inspect all monitor information, issue a subtree search with base
       cn=Monitor, requesting that attributes "+" and "*" are returned.  The
       monitor backend produces mostly operational attributes, and LDAP only
       returns operational attributes that are explicitly requested.
       Requesting attribute "+" is an extension which requests all
       operational attributes.
