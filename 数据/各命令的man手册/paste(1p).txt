       The paste utility shall concatenate the corresponding lines of the
       given input files, and write the resulting lines to standard output.
       The default operation of paste shall concatenate the corresponding
       lines of the input files. The <newline> of every line except the line
       from the last input file shall be replaced with a <tab>.
       If an end-of-file condition is detected on one or more input files,
       but not all input files, paste shall behave as though empty lines
       were read from the files on which end-of-file was detected, unless
       the âˆ’s option is specified.
