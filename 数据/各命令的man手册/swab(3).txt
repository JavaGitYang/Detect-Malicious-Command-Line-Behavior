       The swab() function copies n bytes from the array pointed to by from
       to the array pointed to by to, exchanging adjacent even and odd
       bytes.  This function is used to exchange data between machines that
       have different low/high byte ordering.
       This function does nothing when n is negative.  When n is positive
       and odd, it handles n-1 bytes as above, and does something
       unspecified with the last byte.  (In other words, n should be even.)
