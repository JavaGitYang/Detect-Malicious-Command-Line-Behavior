       selabel_lookup() performs a lookup operation on the handle hnd,
       returning the result in the memory pointed to by context, which must
       be freed by the caller using freecon(3).  The key and type parameters
       are the inputs to the lookup operation and are interpreted according
       to the specific backend that handle is open on.
       selabel_lookup_raw() behaves identically to selabel_lookup() but does
       not perform context translation.
