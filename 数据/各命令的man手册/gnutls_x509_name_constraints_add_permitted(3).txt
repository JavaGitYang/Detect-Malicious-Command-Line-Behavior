       This function will add a name constraint to the list of permitted
       constraints. The constraints  type can be any of the following types:
       GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME, GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME, GNUTLS_SAN_DN,
       GNUTLS_SAN_URI, GNUTLS_SAN_IPADDRESS. For the latter, an IP address
       in network byte order is expected, followed by its network mask.
