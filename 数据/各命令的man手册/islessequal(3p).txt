       The islessequal() macro shall determine whether its first argument is
       less than or equal to its second argument. The value of
       islessequal(x, y) shall be equal to (x) <= (y); however, unlike
       (x) <= (y), islessequal(x, y) shall not raise the invalid floating-
       point exception when x and y are unordered.
