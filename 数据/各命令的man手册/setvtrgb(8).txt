       The setvtrgb command takes a single argument, either the string vga ,
       or a path to a file containing the red, green, and blue colors to be
       used by the Linux virtual terminals.
       If you use the FILE parameter, FILE should be exactly 3 lines of 16
       comma-separated decimal values for RED, GREEN, and BLUE.
       To seed a valid FILE :
              cat /sys/module/vt/parameters/default_{red,grn,blu} > FILE
       And then edit the values in FILE
