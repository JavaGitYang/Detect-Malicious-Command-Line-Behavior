       The trace-cmd(1) stop is a complement to trace-cmd-start(1). This
       will disable Ftrace from writing to the ring buffer. This does not
       stop the overhead that the tracing may incur. Only the updating of
       the ring buffer is disabled, the Ftrace tracing may still be inducing
       overhead.
       After stopping the trace, the trace-cmd-extract(1) may strip out the
       data from the ring buffer and create a trace.dat file. The Ftrace
       pseudo file system may also be examined.
       To disable the tracing completely to remove the overhead it causes,
       use trace-cmd-reset(1). But after a reset is performed, the data that
       has been recorded is lost.
