       lspci is a utility for displaying information about PCI buses in the
       system and devices connected to them.
       By default, it shows a brief list of devices. Use the options
       described below to request either a more verbose output or output
       intended for parsing by other programs.
       If you are going to report bugs in PCI device drivers or in lspci
       itself, please include output of "lspci -vvx" or even better "lspci
       -vvxxx" (however, see below for possible caveats).
       Some parts of the output, especially in the highly verbose modes, are
       probably intelligible only to experienced PCI hackers. For exact
       definitions of the fields, please consult either the PCI
       specifications or the header.h and /usr/include/linux/pci.h include
       files.
       Access to some parts of the PCI configuration space is restricted to
       root on many operating systems, so the features of lspci available to
       normal users are limited. However, lspci tries its best to display as
       much as available and mark all other information with <access denied>
       text.
