       For the instance domain indom, in the current Performance Metrics
       Application Programming Interface (PMAPI) context, locate the
       instance with the internal instance identifier given by inst, and
       return the full external instance identification via name.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       The space for the value of name will have been allocated in
       pmNameInDom with malloc(3), and it is the responsibility of the
       caller to free(3) the space when it is no longer required.
       pmNameInDom returns zero on success.
