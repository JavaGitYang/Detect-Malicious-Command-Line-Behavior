       The pthread_atfork() function registers fork handlers that are to be
       executed when fork(2) is called by this thread.  The handlers are
       executed in the context of the thread that calls fork(2).
       Three kinds of handler can be registered:
       *  prepare specifies a handler that is executed before fork(2)
          processing starts.
       *  parent specifies a handler that is executed in the parent process
          after fork(2) processing completes.
       *  child specifies a handler that is executed in the child process
          after fork(2) processing completes.
       Any of the three arguments may be NULL if no handler is needed in the
       corresponding phase of fork(2) processing.
