       This function will enable or disable the use of private cipher suites
       (the ones that start with 0xFF).  By default or if  allow is 0 then
       these cipher suites will not be advertised nor used.
       Currently GnuTLS does not include such cipher-suites or compression
       algorithms.
       Enabling the private ciphersuites when talking to other than gnutls
       servers and clients may cause interoperability problems.
