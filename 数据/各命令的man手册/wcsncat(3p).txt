       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcsncat() function shall append not more than n wide-character
       codes (a null wide-character code and wide-character codes that
       follow it are not appended) from the array pointed to by ws2 to the
       end of the wide-character string pointed to by ws1.  The initial
       wide-character code of ws2 shall overwrite the null wide-character
       code at the end of ws1.  A terminating null wide-character code shall
       always be appended to the result. If copying takes place between
       objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
