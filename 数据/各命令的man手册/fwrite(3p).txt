       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fwrite() function shall write, from the array pointed to by ptr,
       up to nitems elements whose size is specified by size, to the stream
       pointed to by stream.  For each object, size calls shall be made to
       the fputc() function, taking the values (in order) from an array of
       unsigned char exactly overlaying the object. The file-position
       indicator for the stream (if defined) shall be advanced by the number
       of bytes successfully written. If an error occurs, the resulting
       value of the file-position indicator for the stream is unspecified.
       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution
       of fwrite() and the next successful completion of a call to fflush()
       or fclose() on the same stream, or a call to exit() or abort().
