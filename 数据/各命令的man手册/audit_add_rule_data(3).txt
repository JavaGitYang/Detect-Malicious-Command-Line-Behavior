       audit_add_rule adds an audit rule previously constructed with
       audit_rule_fieldpair_data(3) to one of several kernel event filters.
       The filter is specified by the flags argument. Possible values for
       flags are:
       ·  AUDIT_FILTER_USER - Apply rule to userspace generated messages.
          This is the user filter. Normally all user space originating
          events are accepted. Rules on this filter are typically written to
          block specific events.
       ·  AUDIT_FILTER_TASK - Apply rule at task creation (not syscall).
          This is the task filter. It's normally used to exclude an
          application from being audited.
       ·  AUDIT_FILTER_EXIT - Apply rule at syscall exit. This is the main
          filter that is used for syscalls and filesystem watches. Normally
          all syscall do not trigger events, so this is normally used to
          specify events that are of interest.
       ·  AUDIT_FILTER_TYPE - Apply rule at audit_log_start. This is the
          exclude filter which discards any records that match.  The action
          type is ignored for this filter, defaulting to "never".
       ·      AUDIT_FILTER_FS - Apply rule when adding PATH auxiliary
              records to SYSCALL events. This is the filesystem filter. This
              is used to ignore PATH records that are not of interest.
       The rule's action has two possible values:
       ·  AUDIT_NEVER - Do not build context if rule matches.
       ·  AUDIT_ALWAYS - Generate audit record if rule matches.
