       mysqld_safe is the recommended way to start a mysqld server on Unix.
       mysqld_safe adds some safety features such as restarting the server
       when an error occurs and logging runtime information to an error log
       file. Descriptions of error logging is given later in this section.
       mysqld_safe tries to start an executable named mysqld. To override
       the default behavior and specify explicitly the name of the server
       you want to run, specify a --mysqld or --mysqld-version option to
       mysqld_safe. You can also use --ledir to indicate the directory where
       mysqld_safe should look for the server.
       Many of the options to mysqld_safe are the same as the options to
       mysqld.
       Options unknown to mysqld_safe are passed to mysqld if they are
       specified on the command line, but ignored if they are specified in
       the [mysqld_safe] or [mariadb_safe] groups of an option file.
       mysqld_safe reads all options from the [mysqld], [server],
       [mysqld_safe], and [mariadb_safe] sections in option files. For
       example, if you specify a [mysqld] section like this, mysqld_safe
       will find and use the --log-error option:
           [mysqld]
           log-error=error.log
       For backward compatibility, mysqld_safe also reads [safe_mysqld]
       sections, although you should rename such sections to [mysqld_safe]
       in current installations.
       mysqld_safe supports the options in the following list. It also reads
       option files and supports the options for processing them.
       ·   --help
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --basedir=path
           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.
       ·   --core-file-size=size
           The size of the core file that mysqld should be able to create.
           The option value is passed to ulimit -c.
       ·   --crash-script=file
           Script to call in the event of mysqld crashing.
       ·   --datadir=path
           The path to the data directory.
       ·   --defaults-extra-file=path
           The name of an option file to be read in addition to the usual
           option files. This must be the first option on the command line
           if it is used. If the file does not exist or is otherwise
           inaccessible, the server will exit with an error.
       ·   --defaults-file=file_name
           The name of an option file to be read instead of the usual option
           files. This must be the first option on the command line if it is
           used.
       ·   --flush-caches
           Flush and purge buffers/caches before starting the server.
       ·   --ledir=path
           If mysqld_safe cannot find the server, use this option to
           indicate the path name to the directory where the server is
           located.
       ·   --log-error=file_name
           Write the error log to the given file.
       ·   --malloc-lib=lib
           Preload shared library lib if available.
       ·   --mysqld=prog_name
           The name of the server program (in the ledir directory) that you
           want to start. This option is needed if you use the MariaDB
           binary distribution but have the data directory outside of the
           binary distribution. If mysqld_safe cannot find the server, use
           the --ledir option to indicate the path name to the directory
           where the server is located.
       ·   --mysqld-version=suffix
           This option is similar to the --mysqld option, but you specify
           only the suffix for the server program name. The basename is
           assumed to be mysqld. For example, if you use
           --mysqld-version=debug, mysqld_safe starts the mysqld-debug
           program in the ledir directory. If the argument to
           --mysqld-version is empty, mysqld_safe uses mysqld in the ledir
           directory.
       ·   --nice=priority
           Use the nice program to set the server´s scheduling priority to
           the given value.
       ·   --no-auto-restart
           Exit after starting mysqld.
       ·   --no-defaults
           Do not read any option files. This must be the first option on
           the command line if it is used.
       ·   --no-auto-restart
           Exit after starting mysqld.
       ·   --numa-interleave
           Run mysqld with its memory interleaved on all NUMA nodes.
       ·   --open-files-limit=count
           The number of files that mysqld should be able to open. The
           option value is passed to ulimit -n. Note that you need to start
           mysqld_safe as root for this to work properly!
       ·   --pid-file=file_name
           The path name of the process ID file.
       ·   --plugin-dir=dir_name
           Directory for client-side plugins.
       ·   --port=port_num
           The port number that the server should use when listening for
           TCP/IP connections. The port number must be 1024 or higher unless
           the server is started by the root system user.
       ·   --skip-kill-mysqld
           Do not try to kill stray mysqld processes at startup. This option
           works only on Linux.
       ·   --socket=path
           The Unix socket file that the server should use when listening
           for local connections.
       ·   --syslog, --skip-syslog
           --syslog causes error messages to be sent to syslog on systems
           that support the logger program.  --skip-syslog suppresses the
           use of syslog; messages are written to an error log file.
       ·   --syslog-tag=tag
           For logging to syslog, messages from mysqld_safe and mysqld are
           written with a tag of mysqld_safe and mysqld, respectively. To
           specify a suffix for the tag, use --syslog-tag=tag, which
           modifies the tags to be mysqld_safe-tag and mysqld-tag.
       ·   --timezone=timezone
           Set the TZ time zone environment variable to the given option
           value. Consult your operating system documentation for legal time
           zone specification formats.
       ·   --user={user_name|user_id}
           Run the mysqld server as the user having the name user_name or
           the numeric user ID user_id. (“User” in this context refers to a
           system login account, not a MariaDB user listed in the grant
           tables.)
       If you execute mysqld_safe with the --defaults-file or
       --defaults-extra-file option to name an option file, the option must
       be the first one given on the command line or the option file will
       not be used. For example, this command will not use the named option
       file:
           mysql> mysqld_safe --port=port_num --defaults-file=file_name
       Instead, use the following command:
           mysql> mysqld_safe --defaults-file=file_name --port=port_num
       The mysqld_safe script is written so that it normally can start a
       server that was installed from either a source or a binary
       distribution of MariaDB, even though these types of distributions
       typically install the server in slightly different locations.
       mysqld_safe expects one of the following conditions to be true:
       ·   The server and databases can be found relative to the working
           directory (the directory from which mysqld_safe is invoked). For
           binary distributions, mysqld_safe looks under its working
           directory for bin and data directories. For source distributions,
           it looks for libexec and var directories. This condition should
           be met if you execute mysqld_safe from your MariaDB installation
           directory (for example, /usr/local/mysql for a binary
           distribution).
       ·   If the server and databases cannot be found relative to the
           working directory, mysqld_safe attempts to locate them by
           absolute path names. Typical locations are /usr/local/libexec and
           /usr/local/var. The actual locations are determined from the
           values configured into the distribution at the time it was built.
           They should be correct if MariaDB is installed in the location
           specified at configuration time.
       Because mysqld_safe tries to find the server and databases relative
       to its own working directory, you can install a binary distribution
       of MariaDB anywhere, as long as you run mysqld_safe from the MariaDB
       installation directory:
           shell> cd mysql_installation_directory
           shell> bin/mysqld_safe &
       If mysqld_safe fails, even when invoked from the MariaDB installation
       directory, you can specify the --ledir and --datadir options to
       indicate the directories in which the server and databases are
       located on your system.
       When you use mysqld_safe to start mysqld, mysqld_safe arranges for
       error (and notice) messages from itself and from mysqld to go to the
       same destination.
       There are several mysqld_safe options for controlling the destination
       of these messages:
       ·   --syslog: Write error messages to syslog on systems that support
           the logger program.
       ·   --skip-syslog: Do not write error messages to syslog. Messages
           are written to the default error log file (host_name.err in the
           data directory), or to a named file if the --log-error option is
           given.
       ·   --log-error=file_name: Write error messages to the named error
           file.
       If none of these options is given, the default is --skip-syslog.
           Note
       If --syslog and --log-error are both given, a warning is issued and
       --log-error takes precedence.
       When mysqld_safe writes a message, notices go to the logging
       destination (syslog or the error log file) and stdout. Errors go to
       the logging destination and stderr.
       Normally, you should not edit the mysqld_safe script. Instead,
       configure mysqld_safe by using command-line options or options in the
       [mysqld_safe] section of a my.cnf option file. In rare cases, it
       might be necessary to edit mysqld_safe to get it to start the server
       properly. However, if you do this, your modified version of
       mysqld_safe might be overwritten if you upgrade MariaDB in the
       future, so you should make a copy of your edited version that you can
       reinstall.
       On NetWare, mysqld_safe is a NetWare Loadable Module (NLM) that is
       ported from the original Unix shell script. It starts the server as
       follows:
        1. Runs a number of system and option checks.
        2. Runs a check on MyISAM tables.
        3. Provides a screen presence for the MariaDB server.
        4. Starts mysqld, monitors it, and restarts it if it terminates in
           error.
        5. Sends error messages from mysqld to the host_name.err file in the
           data directory.
        6. Sends mysqld_safe screen output to the host_name.safe file in the
           data directory.
