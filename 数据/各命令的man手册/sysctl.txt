       sysctl.conf is a simple file containing sysctl values to be read in
       and set by sysctl.  The syntax is simply as follows:
              # comment
              ; comment
              token = value
       Note that blank lines are ignored, and whitespace before and after a
       token or value is ignored, although a value can contain whitespace
       within.  Lines which begin with a # or ; are considered comments and
       ignored.
