       Within the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) each instance domain is
       assigned a unique Instance Domain Identifier (pmInDom).  Internally a
       pmInDom is constructed from 2 fields: the domain number (of the
       associated Performance Metrics Domain Agent, or PMDA) and the serial
       number (assigned by the PMDA).
       pmInDom_build constructs a pmInDom from domain and serial.
       pmInDom_domain and pmInDom_serial return the respective fields from
       indom.
