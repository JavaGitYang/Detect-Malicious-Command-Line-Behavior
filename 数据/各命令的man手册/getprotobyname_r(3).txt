       The getprotoent_r(), getprotobyname_r(), and getprotobynumber_r()
       functions are the reentrant equivalents of, respectively,
       getprotoent(3), getprotobyname(3), and getprotobynumber(3).  They
       differ in the way that the protoent structure is returned, and in the
       function calling signature and return value.  This manual page
       describes just the differences from the nonreentrant functions.
       Instead of returning a pointer to a statically allocated protoent
       structure as the function result, these functions copy the structure
       into the location pointed to by result_buf.
       The buf array is used to store the string fields pointed to by the
       returned protoent structure.  (The nonreentrant functions allocate
       these strings in static storage.)  The size of this array is
       specified in buflen.  If buf is too small, the call fails with the
       error ERANGE, and the caller must try again with a larger buffer.  (A
       buffer of length 1024 bytes should be sufficient for most
       applications.)
       If the function call successfully obtains a protocol record, then
       *result is set pointing to result_buf; otherwise, *result is set to
       NULL.
