       The police action allows to limit bandwidth of traffic matched by the
       filter it is attached to. Basically there are two different
       algorithms available to measure the packet rate: The first one uses
       an internal dual token bucket and is configured using the rate,
       burst, mtu, peakrate, overhead and linklayer parameters. The second
       one uses an in-kernel sampling mechanism. It can be fine-tuned using
       the estimator filter parameter.
