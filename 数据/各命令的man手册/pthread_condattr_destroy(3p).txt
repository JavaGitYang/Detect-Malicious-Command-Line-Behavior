       The pthread_condattr_destroy() function shall destroy a condition
       variable attributes object; the object becomes, in effect,
       uninitialized. An implementation may cause pthread_condattr_destroy()
       to set the object referenced by attr to an invalid value. A destroyed
       attr attributes object can be reinitialized using
       pthread_condattr_init(); the results of otherwise referencing the
       object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
       The pthread_condattr_init() function shall initialize a condition
       variable attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       attributes defined by the implementation.
       Results are undefined if pthread_condattr_init() is called specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.
       After a condition variable attributes object has been used to
       initialize one or more condition variables, any function affecting
       the attributes object (including destruction) shall not affect any
       previously initialized condition variables.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 requires two attributes, the clock
       attribute and the process-shared attribute.
       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
       associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
       implementation-defined.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_condattr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized
       condition variable attributes object.
