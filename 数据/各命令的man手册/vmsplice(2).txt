       The vmsplice() system call maps nr_segs ranges of user memory
       described by iov into a pipe.  The file descriptor fd must refer to a
       pipe.
       The pointer iov points to an array of iovec structures as defined in
       <sys/uio.h>:
           struct iovec {
               void  *iov_base;        /* Starting address */
               size_t iov_len;         /* Number of bytes */
           };
       The flags argument is a bit mask that is composed by ORing together
       zero or more of the following values:
       SPLICE_F_MOVE
              Unused for vmsplice(); see splice(2).
       SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK
              Do not block on I/O; see splice(2) for further details.
       SPLICE_F_MORE
              Currently has no effect for vmsplice(), but may be implemented
              in the future; see splice(2).
       SPLICE_F_GIFT
              The user pages are a gift to the kernel.  The application may
              not modify this memory ever, otherwise the page cache and on-
              disk data may differ.  Gifting pages to the kernel means that
              a subsequent splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE can successfully move the
              pages; if this flag is not specified, then a subsequent
              splice(2) SPLICE_F_MOVE must copy the pages.  Data must also
              be properly page aligned, both in memory and length.
