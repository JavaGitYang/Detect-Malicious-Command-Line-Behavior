       This function will return the requested extension OID in the
       certificate, and the critical flag for it.  The extension OID will be
       stored as a string in the provided buffer.  Use
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension() to extract the data.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then
        oid_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned. The  oid returned will be null terminated, although
        oid_size will not account for the trailing null (the latter is not
       true for GnuTLS prior to 3.6.0).
