       The gfortran command supports all the options supported by the gcc
       command.  Only options specific to GNU Fortran are documented here.
       All GCC and GNU Fortran options are accepted both by gfortran and by
       gcc (as well as any other drivers built at the same time, such as
       g++), since adding GNU Fortran to the GCC distribution enables
       acceptance of GNU Fortran options by all of the relevant drivers.
       In some cases, options have positive and negative forms; the negative
       form of -ffoo would be -fno-foo.  This manual documents only one of
       these two forms, whichever one is not the default.
