       The getlogin() function shall return a pointer to a string containing
       the user name associated by the login activity with the controlling
       terminal of the current process. If getlogin() returns a non-null
       pointer, then that pointer points to the name that the user logged in
       under, even if there are several login names with the same user ID.
       The getlogin() function need not be thread-safe.
       The getlogin_r() function shall put the name associated by the login
       activity with the controlling terminal of the current process in the
       character array pointed to by name.  The array is namesize characters
       long and should have space for the name and the terminating null
       character. The maximum size of the login name is {LOGIN_NAME_MAX}.
       If getlogin_r() is successful, name points to the name the user used
       at login, even if there are several login names with the same user
       ID.
       The getlogin() and getlogin_r() functions may make use of file
       descriptors 0, 1, and 2 to find the controlling terminal of the
       current process, examining each in turn until the terminal is found.
       If in this case none of these three file descriptors is open to the
       controlling terminal, these functions may fail. The method used to
       find the terminal associated with a file descriptor may depend on the
       file descriptor being open to the actual terminal device, not
       /dev/tty.
