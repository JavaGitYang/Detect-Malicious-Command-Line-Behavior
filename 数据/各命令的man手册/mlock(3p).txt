       The mlock() function shall cause those whole pages containing any
       part of the address space of the process starting at address addr and
       continuing for len bytes to be memory-resident until unlocked or
       until the process exits or execs another process image. The
       implementation may require that addr be a multiple of {PAGESIZE}.
       The munlock() function shall unlock those whole pages containing any
       part of the address space of the process starting at address addr and
       continuing for len bytes, regardless of how many times mlock() has
       been called by the process for any of the pages in the specified
       range. The implementation may require that addr be a multiple of
       {PAGESIZE}.
       If any of the pages in the range specified to a call to munlock() are
       also mapped into the address spaces of other processes, any locks
       established on those pages by another process are unaffected by the
       call of this process to munlock().  If any of the pages in the range
       specified by a call to munlock() are also mapped into other portions
       of the address space of the calling process outside the range
       specified, any locks established on those pages via the other
       mappings are also unaffected by this call.
       Upon successful return from mlock(), pages in the specified range
       shall be locked and memory-resident. Upon successful return from
       munlock(), pages in the specified range shall be unlocked with
       respect to the address space of the process. Memory residency of
       unlocked pages is unspecified.
       Appropriate privileges are required to lock process memory with
       mlock().
