       The .deb format is the Debian binary package file format. It is
       understood since dpkg 0.93.76, and is generated by default since dpkg
       1.2.0 and 1.1.1elf (i386/ELF builds).
       The format described here is used since Debian 0.93; details of the
       old format are described in deb-old(5).
