       The Babeltrace lttng-utils plugin contains utilities that apply to
       LTTng traces. You can use the source.ctf.fs and source.ctf.lttng-live
       components to read LTTng traces (see babeltrace-plugin-ctf(7)).
       See babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace project
       and its core concepts.
