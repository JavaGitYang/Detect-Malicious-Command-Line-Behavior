       On network interface devices on Linux, pcap_set_protocol() sets the
       protocol to be used in the socket(2) call to create a capture socket
       when the handle is activated.  The argument is a link-layer protocol
       value, such as the values in the <linux/if_ether.h> header file,
       specified in host byte order.  If protocol is non-zero, packets of
       that protocol will be captured when the handle is activated,
       otherwise, all packets will be captured.  This function is only
       provided on Linux, and, if it is used on any device other than a
       network interface, it will have no effect.
       It should not be used in portable code; instead, a filter should be
       specified with pcap_setfilter().
       If a given network interface provides a standard link-layer header,
       with a standard packet type, but provides some packet types with a
       different socket-layer protocol type from the one in the link-layer
       header, that packet type cannot be filtered with a filter specified
       with pcap_setfilter() but can be filtered by specifying the socket-
       layer protocol type using pcap_set_protocol().
