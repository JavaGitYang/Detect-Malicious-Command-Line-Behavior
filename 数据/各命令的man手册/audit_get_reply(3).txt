       This function gets the next data packet sent on the audit netlink
       socket. This function is usually called after sending a command to
       the audit system. fd should be an open file descriptor returned by
       audit_open. rep should be a data structure to put the reply in. block
       is of type reply_t which is either: GET_REPLY_BLOCKING and
       GET_REPLY_NONBLOCKING. peek, if non-zero, gets the data without
       dequeueing it from the netlink socket.
