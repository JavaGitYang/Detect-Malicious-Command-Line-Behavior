       This function will send an alert to the peer in order to inform him
       of something important (eg. his Certificate could not be verified).
       If the alert level is Fatal then the peer is expected to close the
       connection, otherwise he may ignore the alert and continue.
       The error code of the underlying record send function will be
       returned, so you may also receive GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or
       GNUTLS_E_AGAIN as well.
