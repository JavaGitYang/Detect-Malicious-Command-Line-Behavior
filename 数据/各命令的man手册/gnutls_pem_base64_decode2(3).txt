       This function will decode the given encoded data. The decoded data
       will be allocated, and stored into result.  If the header given is
       non null this function will search for "-----BEGIN header" and decode
       only this part. Otherwise it will decode the first PEM packet found.
       You should use gnutls_free() to free the returned data.
       Note, that prior to GnuTLS 3.4.0 this function was available under
       the name gnutls_pem_base64_decode_alloc(). There is compatibility
       macro pointing to this function.
