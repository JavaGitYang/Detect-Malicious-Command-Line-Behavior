       The Sync Provider overlay implements the provider-side support for
       the LDAP Content Synchronization (RFC4533) as well as syncrepl
       replication support.  The overlay can be used with any backend that
       maintains entryCSN and entryUUID attributes for its entries. It also
       creates a contextCSN attribute in the root entry of the database.
       The contextCSN is updated for every write operation performed against
       the database. To reduce database contention, the contextCSN is only
       updated in memory. The value is written to the database on server
       shutdown and read into memory on startup, and maintained in memory
       thereafter. Checkpoints may be configured to write the contextCSN
       into the underlying database to minimize recovery time after an
       unclean shutdown.
       On databases that support inequality indexing, it is mandatory to set
       an eq index on the entryCSN attribute when using this overlay.
