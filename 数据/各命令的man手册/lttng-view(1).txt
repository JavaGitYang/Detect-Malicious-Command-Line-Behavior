       The lttng view command launches an external trace viewer to view the
       current trace of a tracing session.
       If SESSION is omitted, the viewer is launched for the current tracing
       session (see lttng-create(1) for more information about the current
       tracing session). Otherwise, it is launched for the existing tracing
       session named SESSION. lttng list outputs all the existing tracing
       sessions (see lttng-list(1)).
       By default, the babeltrace(1) trace viewer is launched. Another trace
       viewer command can be specified using the --viewer option.
       By default, the trace path of the chosen tracing session is given as
       the first positional argument to the trace viewer. This path can be
       overridden using the --trace-path option.
