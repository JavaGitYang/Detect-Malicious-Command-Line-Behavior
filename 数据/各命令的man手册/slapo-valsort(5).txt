       The Value Sorting overlay can be used with a backend database to sort
       the values of specific multi-valued attributes within a subtree. The
       sorting occurs whenever the attributes are returned in a search
       response.
       Sorting can be specified in ascending or descending order, using
       either numeric or alphanumeric sort methods. Additionally, a
       "weighted" sort can be specified, which uses a numeric weight
       prepended to the attribute values.  The weighted sort is always
       performed in ascending order, but may be combined with the other
       methods for values that all have equal weights. The weight is
       specified by prepending an integer weight {<weight>} in front of each
       value of the attribute for which weighted sorting is desired. This
       weighting factor is stripped off and not returned in search results
       unless the valsort control is specified (1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.5.14).
       The valsort control requires a value consisting of a Sequence that
       contains a boolean flag. The weighting factor is only returned if the
       boolean value is TRUE. In lber-encode(3) format, the required value
       must conform to "{b}" syntax.
