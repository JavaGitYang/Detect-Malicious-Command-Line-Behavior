       The uncompress utility shall restore files to their original state
       after they have been compressed using the compress utility. If no
       files are specified, the standard input shall be uncompressed to the
       standard output. If the invoking process has appropriate privileges,
       the ownership, modes, access time, and modification time of the
       original file shall be preserved.
       This utility shall support the uncompressing of any files produced by
       the compress utility on the same implementation. For files produced
       by compress on other systems, uncompress supports 9 to 14-bit
       compression (see compress(1p), −b); it is implementation-defined
       whether values of −b greater than 14 are supported.
