       astraceroute is a small utility to retrieve path information in a
       traceroute like way, but with additional geographical location
       information. It tracks the route of a packet from the local host to
       the remote host by successively increasing the IP's TTL field,
       starting from 1, in the hope that each intermediate node will send an
       ICMP TIME_EXCEEDED notification back to the local host when the TTL
       value is decremented to 0.
       astraceroute supports IPv4 and IPv6 queries and will display country
       and city information, if available, the AS number the hop belongs to,
       and its ISP name. astraceroute also displays timing information and
       reverse DNS data.
       Due to astraceroute's configurability, it is also possible to gather
       some more useful information about the hop regarding what it does and
       does not allow to pass through. This is done by using clear text
       strings for probing DPIs or ``great firewalls'' to determine if they
       will filter out blacklisted critical keywords. This tool might be a
       good start for further in-depth analysis of such systems.
