       re_comp() is used to compile the null-terminated regular expression
       pointed to by regex.  The compiled pattern occupies a static area,
       the pattern buffer, which is overwritten by subsequent use of
       re_comp().  If regex is NULL, no operation is performed and the
       pattern buffer's contents are not altered.
       re_exec() is used to assess whether the null-terminated string
       pointed to by string matches the previously compiled regex.
