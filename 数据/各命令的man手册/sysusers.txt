       systemd-sysusers uses the files from sysusers.d directory to create
       system users and groups at package installation or boot time. This
       tool may be used to allocate system users and groups only, it is not
       useful for creating non-system users and groups, as it accesses
       /etc/passwd and /etc/group directly, bypassing any more complex user
       databases, for example any database involving NIS or LDAP.
