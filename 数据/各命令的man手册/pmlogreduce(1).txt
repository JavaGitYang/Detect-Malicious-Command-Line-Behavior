       pmlogreduce reads one set of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives
       identified by input and creates a temporally reduced PCP archive in
       output.  input is a comma-separated list of names, each of which may
       be the base name of an archive or the name of a directory containing
       one or more archives.  The data reduction involves statistical and
       temporal reduction of samples with an output sampling interval
       defined by the -t option in the output archive (independent of the
       sampling intervals in the input archives), and is further controlled
       by other command line arguments.
       For some metrics, temporal data reduction is not going to be helpful,
       so for metrics with types PM_TYPE_AGGREGATE or PM_TYPE_EVENT, a
       warning is issued if these metrics are found in input and they will
       be skipped and not appear in the output archive.
