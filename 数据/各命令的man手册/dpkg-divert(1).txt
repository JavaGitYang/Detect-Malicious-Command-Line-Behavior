       dpkg-divert is the utility used to set up and update the list of
       diversions.
       File diversions are a way of forcing dpkg(1) not to install a file
       into its location, but to a diverted location. Diversions can be used
       through the Debian package scripts to move a file away when it causes
       a conflict. System administrators can also use it to override some
       package's configuration file, or whenever some files (which aren't
       marked as “conffiles”) need to be preserved by dpkg, when installing
       a newer version of a package which contains those files.
