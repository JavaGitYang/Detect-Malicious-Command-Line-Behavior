       Rtnetlink allows the kernel's routing tables to be read and altered.
       It is used within the kernel to communicate between various
       subsystems, though this usage is not documented here, and for
       communication with user-space programs.  Network routes, IP
       addresses, link parameters, neighbor setups, queueing disciplines,
       traffic classes and packet classifiers may all be controlled through
       NETLINK_ROUTE sockets.  It is based on netlink messages; see
       netlink(7) for more information.
   Routing attributes
       Some rtnetlink messages have optional attributes after the initial
       header:
           struct rtattr {
               unsigned short rta_len;    /* Length of option */
               unsigned short rta_type;   /* Type of option */
               /* Data follows */
           };
       These attributes should be manipulated using only the RTA_* macros or
       libnetlink, see rtnetlink(3).
   Messages
       Rtnetlink consists of these message types (in addition to standard
       netlink messages):
       RTM_NEWLINK, RTM_DELLINK, RTM_GETLINK
              Create, remove or get information about a specific network
              interface.  These messages contain an ifinfomsg structure fol‐
              lowed by a series of rtattr structures.
              struct ifinfomsg {
                  unsigned char  ifi_family; /* AF_UNSPEC */
                  unsigned short ifi_type;   /* Device type */
                  int            ifi_index;  /* Interface index */
                  unsigned int   ifi_flags;  /* Device flags  */
                  unsigned int   ifi_change; /* change mask */
              };
              ifi_flags contains the device flags, see netdevice(7);
              ifi_index is the unique interface index (since Linux 3.7, it
              is possible to feed a nonzero value with the RTM_NEWLINK mes‐
              sage, thus creating a link with the given ifindex); ifi_change
              is reserved for future use and should be always set to
              0xFFFFFFFF.

              IFLA_STATS       see below          Interface Statistics.
       The value type for IFLA_STATS is struct rtnl_link_stats (struct
       net_device_stats in Linux 2.4 and earlier).
       RTM_NEWADDR, RTM_DELADDR, RTM_GETADDR
              Add, remove or receive information about an IP address associ‐
              ated with an interface.  In Linux 2.2, an interface can carry
              multiple IP addresses, this replaces the alias device concept
              in 2.0.  In Linux 2.2, these messages support IPv4 and IPv6
              addresses.  They contain an ifaddrmsg structure, optionally
              followed by rtattr routing attributes.
              struct ifaddrmsg {
                  unsigned char ifa_family;    /* Address type */
                  unsigned char ifa_prefixlen; /* Prefixlength of address */
                  unsigned char ifa_flags;     /* Address flags */
                  unsigned char ifa_scope;     /* Address scope */
                  int           ifa_index;     /* Interface index */
              };
              ifa_family is the address family type (currently AF_INET or
              AF_INET6), ifa_prefixlen is the length of the address mask of
              the address if defined for the family (like for IPv4),
              ifa_scope is the address scope, ifa_index is the interface
              index of the interface the address is associated with.
              ifa_flags is a flag word of IFA_F_SECONDARY for secondary
              address (old alias interface), IFA_F_PERMANENT for a permanent
              address set by the user and other undocumented flags.

       RTM_NEWROUTE, RTM_DELROUTE, RTM_GETROUTE
              Create, remove or receive information about a network route.
              These messages contain an rtmsg structure with an optional
              sequence of rtattr structures following.  For RTM_GETROUTE,
              setting rtm_dst_len and rtm_src_len to 0 means you get all
              entries for the specified routing table.  For the other
              fields, except rtm_table and rtm_protocol, 0 is the wildcard.
              struct rtmsg {
                  unsigned char rtm_family;   /* Address family of route */

              Values larger than RTPROT_STATIC are not interpreted by the
              kernel, they are just for user information.  They may be used
              to tag the source of a routing information or to distinguish
              between multiple routing daemons.  See <linux/rtnetlink.h> for
              the routing daemon identifiers which are already assigned.
              rtm_scope is the distance to the destination:
              RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE   global route
              RT_SCOPE_SITE       interior route in the
                                  local autonomous system

              RT_SCOPE_HOST       route on the local host
              RT_SCOPE_NOWHERE    destination doesn't exist
              The values between RT_SCOPE_UNIVERSE and RT_SCOPE_SITE are
              available to the user.
              The rtm_flags have the following meanings:
              RTM_F_NOTIFY     if the route changes, notify the user via
                               rtnetlink
              RTM_F_CLONED     route is cloned from another route
              RTM_F_EQUALIZE   a multipath equalizer (not yet implemented)

              RT_TABLE_UNSPEC    an unspecified routing table
              RT_TABLE_DEFAULT   the default table
              RT_TABLE_MAIN      the main table
              RT_TABLE_LOCAL     the local table
              The user may assign arbitrary values between RT_TABLE_UNSPEC
              and RT_TABLE_DEFAULT.

              ndm_state is a bit mask of the following states:

              NUD_REACHABLE    a confirmed working cache entry
              NUD_STALE        an expired cache entry

              NUD_FAILED       an invalid cache entry
              NUD_NOARP        a device with no destination cache
              NUD_PERMANENT    a static entry
              Valid ndm_flags are:
              NTF_PROXY    a proxy arp entry
              NTF_ROUTER   an IPv6 router
              The rtattr struct has the following meanings for the rta_type
              field:
              NDA_UNSPEC      unknown type
              NDA_DST         a neighbor cache n/w layer destination address
              NDA_LLADDR      a neighbor cache link layer address
              NDA_CACHEINFO   cache statistics.
              If the rta_type field is NDA_CACHEINFO, then a struct
