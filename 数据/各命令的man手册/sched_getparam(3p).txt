       The sched_getparam() function shall return the scheduling parameters
       of a process specified by pid in the sched_param structure pointed to
       by param.
       If a process specified by pid exists, and if the calling process has
       permission, the scheduling parameters for the process whose process
       ID is equal to pid shall be returned.
       If pid is zero, the scheduling parameters for the calling process
       shall be returned. The behavior of the sched_getparam() function is
       unspecified if the value of pid is negative.
