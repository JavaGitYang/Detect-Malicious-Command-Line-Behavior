       pcap_open_offline() and pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision() are
       called to open a ``savefile'' for reading.
       fname specifies the name of the file to open. The file can have the
       pcap file format as described in pcap-savefile(5), which is the file
       format used by, among other programs, tcpdump(1) and tcpslice(1), or
       can have the pcapng file format, although not all pcapng files can be
       read.  The name "-" is a synonym for stdin.
       pcap_open_offline_with_tstamp_precision() takes an additional
       precision argument specifying the time stamp precision desired; if
       PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_MICRO is specified, packet time stamps will be
       supplied in seconds and microseconds, and if
       PCAP_TSTAMP_PRECISION_NANO is specified, packet time stamps will be
       supplied in seconds and nanoseconds.  If the time stamps in the file
       do not have the same precision as the requested precision, they will
       be scaled up or down as necessary before being supplied.
       Alternatively, you may call pcap_fopen_offline() or
       pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision() to read dumped data from
       an existing open stream fp.
       pcap_fopen_offline_with_tstamp_precision() takes an additional
       precision argument as described above.  Note that on Windows, that
       stream should be opened in binary mode.
