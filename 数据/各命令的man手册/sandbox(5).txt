       When running sandbox with the -C argument, it will be confined using
       control groups and a system administrator can specify how the sandbox
       is confined.
       Everything after "#" is ignored, as are empty lines.  All arguments
       should be separated by and equals sign ("=").
       These keywords are allowed.
