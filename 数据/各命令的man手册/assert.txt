       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The <assert.h> header shall define the assert() macro. It refers to
       the macro NDEBUG which is not defined in the header. If NDEBUG is
       defined as a macro name before the inclusion of this header, the
       assert() macro shall be defined simply as:
           #define assert(ignore)((void) 0)
       Otherwise, the macro behaves as described in assert().
       The assert() macro shall be redefined according to the current state
       of NDEBUG each time <assert.h> is included.
       The assert() macro shall be implemented as a macro, not as a
       function. If the macro definition is suppressed in order to access an
       actual function, the behavior is undefined.
       The following sections are informative.
