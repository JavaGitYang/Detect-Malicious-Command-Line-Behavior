       The recvmmsg() system call is an extension of recvmsg(2) that allows
       the caller to receive multiple messages from a socket using a single
       system call.  (This has performance benefits for some applications.)
       A further extension over recvmsg(2) is support for a timeout on the
       receive operation.
       The sockfd argument is the file descriptor of the socket to receive
       data from.
       The msgvec argument is a pointer to an array of mmsghdr structures.
       The size of this array is specified in vlen.
       The mmsghdr structure is defined in <sys/socket.h> as:
           struct mmsghdr {
               struct msghdr msg_hdr;  /* Message header */
               unsigned int  msg_len;  /* Number of received bytes for header */
           };
       The msg_hdr field is a msghdr structure, as described in recvmsg(2).
       The msg_len field is the number of bytes returned for the message in
       the entry.  This field has the same value as the return value of a
       single recvmsg(2) on the header.
       The flags argument contains flags ORed together.  The flags are the
       same as documented for recvmsg(2), with the following addition:
       MSG_WAITFORONE (since Linux 2.6.34)
              Turns on MSG_DONTWAIT after the first message has been
              received.
       The timeout argument points to a struct timespec (see
       clock_gettime(2)) defining a timeout (seconds plus nanoseconds) for
       the receive operation (but see BUGS!).  (This interval will be
       rounded up to the system clock granularity, and kernel scheduling
       delays mean that the blocking interval may overrun by a small
       amount.)  If timeout is NULL, then the operation blocks indefinitely.
       A blocking recvmmsg() call blocks until vlen messages have been
       received or until the timeout expires.  A nonblocking call reads as
       many messages as are available (up to the limit specified by vlen)
       and returns immediately.
       On return from recvmmsg(), successive elements of msgvec are updated
       to contain information about each received message: msg_len contains
       the size of the received message; the subfields of msg_hdr are
       updated as described in recvmsg(2).  The return value of the call
       indicates the number of elements of msgvec that have been updated.
