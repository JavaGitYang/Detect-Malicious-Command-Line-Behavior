       This function will set the timeouts required for the DTLS handshake
       protocol. The retransmission timeout is the time after which a
       message from the peer is not received, the previous messages will be
       retransmitted. The total timeout is the time after which the
       handshake will be aborted with GNUTLS_E_TIMEDOUT.
       The DTLS protocol recommends the values of 1 sec and 60 seconds
       respectively, and these are the default values.
       To disable retransmissions set a  retrans_timeout larger than the
       total_timeout .
