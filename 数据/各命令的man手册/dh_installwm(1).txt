       dh_installwm is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating the postinst and prerm commands that register a window
       manager with update-alternatives(8). The window manager's man page is
       also registered as a slave symlink (in v6 mode and up).  It must be
       installed in usr/share/man/man1/ in the package build directory prior
       to calling dh_installwm.  In compat 9 and earlier, the manpage was
       optional.
