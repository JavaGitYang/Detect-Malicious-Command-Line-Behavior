       xfs_io is a debugging tool like xfs_db(8), but is aimed at examining
       the regular file I/O paths rather than the raw XFS volume itself.
       These code paths include not only the obvious read/write/mmap
       interfaces for manipulating files, but also cover all of the XFS
       extensions (such as space preallocation, additional inode flags,
       etc).
