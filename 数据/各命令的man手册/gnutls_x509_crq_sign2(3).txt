       This function will sign the certificate request with a private key.
       This must be the same key as the one used in
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_key() since a certificate request is self signed.
       This must be the last step in a certificate request generation since
       all the previously set parameters are now signed.
       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed request
       will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification),
       until it is exported an re-imported.
       After GnuTLS 3.6.1 the value of  dig may be GNUTLS_DIG_UNKNOWN, and
       in that case, a suitable but reasonable for the key algorithm will be
       selected.
