       The readlink() function shall place the contents of the symbolic link
       referred to by path in the buffer buf which has size bufsize.  If the
       number of bytes in the symbolic link is less than bufsize, the
       contents of the remainder of buf are unspecified. If the buf argument
       is not large enough to contain the link content, the first bufsize
       bytes shall be placed in buf.
       If the value of bufsize is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
       implementation-defined.
       Upon successful completion, readlink() shall mark for update the last
       data access timestamp of the symbolic link.
       The readlinkat() function shall be equivalent to the readlink()
       function except in the case where path specifies a relative path. In
       this case the symbolic link whose content is read is relative to the
       directory associated with the file descriptor fd instead of the
       current working directory. If the file descriptor was opened without
       O_SEARCH, the function shall check whether directory searches are
       permitted using the current permissions of the directory underlying
       the file descriptor. If the file descriptor was opened with O_SEARCH,
       the function shall not perform the check.
       If readlinkat() is passed the special value AT_FDCWD in the fd
       parameter, the current working directory shall be used and the
       behavior shall be identical to a call to readlink().
