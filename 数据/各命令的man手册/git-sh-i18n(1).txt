       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.
       The 'git sh-i18n scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by
       Gitâ€™s porcelain programs implemented in shell script. It provides
       wrappers for the GNU gettext and eval_gettext functions accessible
       through the gettext.sh script, and provides pass-through fallbacks on
       systems without GNU gettext.
