     The acl_get_file() function retrieves the access ACL associated with a
     file or directory, or the default ACL associated with a directory. The
     pathname for the file or directory is pointed to by the argument
     path_p.  The ACL is placed into working storage and acl_get_file()
     returns a pointer to that storage.
     In order to read an ACL from an object, a process must have read access
     to the object's attributes.
     The value of the argument type is used to indicate whether the access
     ACL or the default ACL associated with path_p is returned. If type is
     ACL_TYPE_ACCESS, the access ACL of path_p is returned. If type is
     ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT, the default ACL of path_p is returned. If type is
     ACL_TYPE_DEFAULT and no default ACL is associated with the directory
     path_p, then an ACL containing zero ACL entries is returned. If type
     specifies a type of ACL that cannot be associated with path_p, then the
     function fails.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‚Äê
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_get_file() as an
     argument.
