       lsblk lists information about all available or the specified block
       devices.  The lsblk command reads the sysfs filesystem and udev db to
       gather information. If the udev db is not available or lsblk is
       compiled without udev support than it tries to read LABELs, UUIDs and
       filesystem types from the block device. In this case root permissions
       are necessary.
       The command prints all block devices (except RAM disks) in a tree-
       like format by default.  Use lsblk --help to get a list of all
       available columns.
       The default output, as well as the default output from options like
       --fs and --topology, is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you
       should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using --output columns-list in
       environments where a stable output is required.
       Note that lsblk might be executed in time when udev does not have all
       information about recently added or modified devices yet. In this
       case it is recommended to use udevadm settle before lsblk to
       synchronize with udev.
