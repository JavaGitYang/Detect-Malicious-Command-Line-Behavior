       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), this group of routines is used to implement the processing
       of a PMDA's metric help information.
       These routines are really intended for internal use, and should not
       need to be called directly from any PMDA code.
       Briefly, the base name of the help text file (as created by
       newhelp(1)) is passed in via a -h command line option for a daemon
       PMDA or as an argument to pmdaDaemon(3) or pmdaDSO(3).  Then
       pmdaOpenHelp is called from pmdaInit(3) and returns a handle that is
       used in subsequent calls to identify a particular help text
       collection (each PMDA typically has only one such collection).
       Requests for help text are passed to pmdaText(3) which calls
       pmdaGetHelp or pmdaGetInDomHelp as required.
       Other than error cases in pmdaOpenHelp, pmdaCloseHelp is not called.
