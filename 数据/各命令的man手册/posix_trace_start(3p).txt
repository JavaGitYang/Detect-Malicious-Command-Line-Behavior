       The posix_trace_start() and posix_trace_stop() functions,
       respectively, shall start and stop the trace stream identified by the
       argument trid.
       The effect of calling the posix_trace_start() function shall be
       recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace
       event and the status of the trace stream shall become
       POSIX_TRACE_RUNNING.  If the trace stream is in progress when this
       function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event shall
       not be recorded and the trace stream shall continue to run. If the
       trace stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_START system trace event shall
       not be recorded and the status of the trace stream shall not be
       changed.
       The effect of calling the posix_trace_stop() function shall be
       recorded in the trace stream as the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace
       event and the status of the trace stream shall become
       POSIX_TRACE_SUSPENDED.  If the trace stream is suspended when this
       function is called, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not
       be recorded and the trace stream shall remain suspended. If the trace
       stream is full, the POSIX_TRACE_STOP system trace event shall not be
       recorded and the status of the trace stream shall not be changed.
