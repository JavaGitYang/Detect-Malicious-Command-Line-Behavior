       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The isgreaterequal() macro shall determine whether its first argument
       is greater than or equal to its second argument. The value of
       isgreaterequal(x, y) shall be equal to (x) ≥ (y); however, unlike
       (x) ≥ (y), isgreaterequal(x, y) shall not raise the invalid floating-
       point exception when x and y are unordered.
