       fallocate is used to manipulate the allocated disk space for a file,
       either to deallocate or preallocate it.  For filesystems which
       support the fallocate system call, preallocation is done quickly by
       allocating blocks and marking them as uninitialized, requiring no IO
       to the data blocks.  This is much faster than creating a file by
       filling it with zeroes.
       The exit code returned by fallocate is 0 on success and 1 on failure.
