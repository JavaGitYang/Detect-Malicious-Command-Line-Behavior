       bno_plot is a visualization tool for the block layer IO tracing tool
       called blktrace(8).  As noted in its documentation, blktrace is a
       block layer IO tracing mechanism which provides detailed information
       about request queue operations up to user space.
       bno_plot utilizes gnuplot to generate a 3D plot of the block number
       output from btt.  If no <files> are specified, it will utilize all
       files generated after btt was run with -B blknos (meaning: all files
       of the form blknos*[rw].dat).
       The -K option forces bno_plot to put the keys below the graph.  If it
       is not specified, all keys for input files are put in the upper right
       corner of the graph. If the number of devices exceed 10, then
       bno_plot will automatically push the keys under the graph.
       To use this utility, the gnuplot package needs to be installed.
       To exit the plotter, enter 'quit' or ^D at the 'gnuplot> ' prompt.
