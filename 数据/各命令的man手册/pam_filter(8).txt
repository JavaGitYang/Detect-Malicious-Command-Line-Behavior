       This module is intended to be a platform for providing access to all
       of the input/output that passes between the user and the application.
       It is only suitable for tty-based and (stdin/stdout) applications.
       To function this module requires filters to be installed on the
       system. The single filter provided with the module simply transposes
       upper and lower case letters in the input and output streams. (This
       can be very annoying and is not kind to termcap based editors).
       Each component of the module has the potential to invoke the desired
       filter. The filter is always execv(2) with the privilege of the
       calling application and not that of the user. For this reason it
       cannot usually be killed by the user without closing their session.
