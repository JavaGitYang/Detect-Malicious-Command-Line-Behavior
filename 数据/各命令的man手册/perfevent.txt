       The perfevent.conf configuration file defines which hardware
       performance counters are enabled by the perfevent PMDA.
       The configuration file contains a list of events that should be
       enabled for each PMU. The perfevent PMDA detects which PMUs present
       and programs the configured events. If multiple PMUs are available,
       the perfevent PMDA uses the order of the entries in the configuration
       file to determine which PMU settings to use. The entries at the top
       of the configuration file have higher precedence.  Only one PMU
       configuration setting is used. The configuration file may also
       contain perf derived events. A derived event has a list of events
       which must be listed as base events. The values for the counters in
       the derived events are aggregated and displayed.
