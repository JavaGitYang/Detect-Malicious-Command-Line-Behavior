       brctl is used to set up, maintain, and inspect the ethernet bridge
       configuration in the Linux kernel.
       An ethernet bridge is a device commonly used to connect different
       networks of ethernets together, so that these ethernets will appear
       as one ethernet to the participants.
       Each of the ethernets being connected corresponds to one physical
       interface in the bridge. These individual ethernets are bundled into
       one bigger ('logical') ethernet, this bigger ethernet corresponds to
       the bridge network interface.
