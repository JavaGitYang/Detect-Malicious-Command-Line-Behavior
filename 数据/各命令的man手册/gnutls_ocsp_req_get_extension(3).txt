       This function will return all information about the requested
       extension in the OCSP request.  The information returned is the OID,
       the critical flag, and the data itself.  The extension OID will be
       stored as a string.  Any of  oid ,  critical , and  data may be NULL
       which means that the caller is not interested in getting that
       information back.
       The caller needs to deallocate memory by calling gnutls_free() on
        oid ->data and  data ->data.
