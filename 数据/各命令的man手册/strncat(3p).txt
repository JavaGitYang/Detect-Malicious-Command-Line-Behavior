       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The strncat() function shall append not more than n bytes (a NUL
       character and bytes that follow it are not appended) from the array
       pointed to by s2 to the end of the string pointed to by s1.  The
       initial byte of s2 overwrites the NUL character at the end of s1.  A
       terminating NUL character is always appended to the result. If
       copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.
