       The pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() and
       pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling() functions, respectively, shall get
       and set the priority ceiling attribute of a mutex attributes object
       pointed to by attr which was previously created by the function
       pthread_mutexattr_init().
       The prioceiling attribute contains the priority ceiling of
       initialized mutexes. The values of prioceiling are within the maximum
       range of priorities defined by SCHED_FIFO.
       The prioceiling attribute defines the priority ceiling of initialized
       mutexes, which is the minimum priority level at which the critical
       section guarded by the mutex is executed. In order to avoid priority
       inversion, the priority ceiling of the mutex shall be set to a
       priority higher than or equal to the highest priority of all the
       threads that may lock that mutex. The values of prioceiling are
       within the maximum range of priorities defined under the SCHED_FIFO
       scheduling policy.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_mutexattr_getprioceiling() or
       pthread_mutexattr_setprioceiling() does not refer to an initialized
       mutex attributes object.
