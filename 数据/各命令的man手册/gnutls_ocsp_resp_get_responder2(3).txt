       This function will extract the name of the Basic OCSP Response in the
       provided buffer. The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz"
       as described in RFC2253. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
       encoded, depending on the certificate data.
       If the responder ID is not a name but a hash, this function will
       return zero and the  dn elements will be set to NULL.
       The caller needs to deallocate memory by calling gnutls_free() on
        dn ->data.
       When the flag GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT is specified, the output
       format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of
       GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.
