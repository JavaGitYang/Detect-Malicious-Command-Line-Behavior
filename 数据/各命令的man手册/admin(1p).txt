       The admin utility shall create new SCCS files or change parameters of
       existing ones. If a named file does not exist, it shall be created,
       and its parameters shall be initialized according to the specified
       options.  Parameters not initialized by an option shall be assigned a
       default value. If a named file does exist, parameters corresponding
       to specified options shall be changed, and other parameters shall be
       left as is.
       All SCCS filenames supplied by the application shall be of the form
       s.filename. New SCCS files shall be given read-only permission mode.
       Write permission in the parent directory is required to create a
       file. All writing done by admin shall be to a temporary x-file, named
       x.filename (see get(1p)) created with read-only mode if admin is
       creating a new SCCS file, or created with the same mode as that of
       the SCCS file if the file already exists. After successful execution
       of admin, the SCCS file shall be removed (if it exists), and the x-
       file shall be renamed with the name of the SCCS file. This ensures
       that changes are made to the SCCS file only if no errors occur.
       The admin utility shall also use a transient lock file (named
       z.filename), which is used to prevent simultaneous updates to the
       SCCS file; see get(1p).
