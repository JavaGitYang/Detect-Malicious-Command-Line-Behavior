       sd_bus_get_fd() returns the file descriptor used to communicate with
       the message bus. This descriptor can be used with select(3), poll(3),
       or similar functions to wait for incoming messages.
       If the bus was created with the sd_bus_set_fd(3) function, then the
       input_fd used in that call is returned.
