       The collect overlay is used to provide a relatively coarse
       implementation of RFC 3671 collective attributes.  In X.500, a
       collective attribute is "a user attribute whose values are the same
       for each member of an entry collection".
       Collective attributes are added to entries returned by a search
       operation when the entry is within the scope of the related ancestor.
       Collective attributes can only be modified when the modification
       affects the related ancestor.
