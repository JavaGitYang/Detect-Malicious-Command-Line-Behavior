       The QmcSource class maintains a unique list of all metric sources in
       use to minimize the creation of new contexts (see pmNewContext(3))
       when the context could have been duplicated (see pmDupContext(3)).
       This also reduces the duplication of descriptions of each source.
       In general, QMC users should only need to access QmcSource methods to
       obtain source descriptions for a QmcContext(3) object.  All context
       creation by the user should be handled through QmcGroup(3).
