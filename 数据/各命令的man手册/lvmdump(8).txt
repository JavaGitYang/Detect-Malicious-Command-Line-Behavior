       lvmdump is a tool to dump various information concerning LVM2.  By
       default, it creates a tarball suitable for submission along with a
       problem report.
       The content of the tarball is as follows:
       - dmsetup info
       - table of currently running processes
       - recent entries from /var/log/messages (containing system messages)
       - complete lvm configuration and cache (content of /etc/lvm)
       - list of device nodes present under /dev
       - list of files present /sys/block
       - list of files present /sys/devices/virtual/block
       - if enabled with -m, metadata dump will be also included
       - if enabled with -a, debug output of vgscan, pvscan and list of all
       available volume groups, physical volumes and logical volumes will be
       included
       - if enabled with -c, cluster status info
       - if enabled with -l, lvmetad state if running
