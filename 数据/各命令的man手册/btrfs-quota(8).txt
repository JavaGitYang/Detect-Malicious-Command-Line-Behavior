       The commands under btrfs quota are used to affect the global status
       of quotas of a btrfs filesystem. The quota groups (qgroups) are
       managed by the subcommand btrfs qgroup(8).
           Note
           Qgroups are different than the traditional user quotas and
           designed to track shared and exclusive data per-subvolume. Please
           refer to the section HIERARCHICAL QUOTA GROUP CONCEPTS for a
           detailed description.
   PERFORMANCE IMPLICATIONS
       When quotas are activated, they affect all extent processing, which
       takes a performance hit. Activation of qgroups is not recommended
       unless the user intends to actually use them.
   STABILITY STATUS
       The qgroup implementation has turned out to be quite difficult as it
       affects the core of the filesystem operation. Qgroup users have hit
       various corner cases over time, such as incorrect accounting or
       system instability. The situation is gradually improving and issues
       found and fixed.
