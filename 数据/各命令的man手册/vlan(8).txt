       The vlan action allows to perform 802.1Q en- or decapsulation on a
       packet, reflected by the operation modes POP, PUSH and MODIFY.  The
       POP mode is simple, as no further information is required to just
       drop the outer-most VLAN encapsulation. The PUSH and MODIFY modes
       require at least a VLANID and allow to optionally choose the
       VLANPROTO to use.
