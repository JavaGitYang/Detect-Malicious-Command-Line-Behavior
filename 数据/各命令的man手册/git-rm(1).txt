       Remove files from the index, or from the working tree and the index.
       git rm will not remove a file from just your working directory.
       (There is no option to remove a file only from the working tree and
       yet keep it in the index; use /bin/rm if you want to do that.) The
       files being removed have to be identical to the tip of the branch,
       and no updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though
       that default behavior can be overridden with the -f option. When
       --cached is given, the staged content has to match either the tip of
       the branch or the file on disk, allowing the file to be removed from
       just the index.
