       The aio_read() function shall read aiocbp->aio_nbytes from the file
       associated with aiocbp->aio_fildes into the buffer pointed to by
       aiocbp->aio_buf. The function call shall return when the read request
       has been initiated or queued to the file or device (even when the
       data cannot be delivered immediately).
       If prioritized I/O is supported for this file, then the asynchronous
       operation shall be submitted at a priority equal to a base scheduling
       priority minus aiocbp->aio_reqprio. If Thread Execution Scheduling is
       not supported, then the base scheduling priority is that of the
       calling process;
       otherwise, the base scheduling priority is that of the calling
       thread.
       The aiocbp value may be used as an argument to aio_error() and
       aio_return() in order to determine the error status and return
       status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is
       proceeding. If an error condition is encountered during queuing, the
       function call shall return without having initiated or queued the
       request. The requested operation takes place at the absolute position
       in the file as given by aio_offset, as if lseek() were called
       immediately prior to the operation with an offset equal to aio_offset
       and a whence equal to SEEK_SET.  After a successful call to enqueue
       an asynchronous I/O operation, the value of the file offset for the
       file is unspecified.
       The aio_sigevent member specifies the notification which occurs when
       the request is completed.
       The aiocbp->aio_lio_opcode field shall be ignored by aio_read().
       The aiocbp argument points to an aiocb structure. If the buffer
       pointed to by aiocbp->aio_buf or the control block pointed to by
       aiocbp becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O
       completion, then the behavior is undefined.
       Simultaneous asynchronous operations using the same aiocbp produce
       undefined results.
       If synchronized I/O is enabled on the file associated with
       aiocbp->aio_fildes, the behavior of this function shall be according
       to the definitions of synchronized I/O data integrity completion and
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion.
       For any system action that changes the process memory space while an
       asynchronous I/O is outstanding to the address range being changed,
       the result of that action is undefined.
       For regular files, no data transfer shall occur past the offset
       maximum established in the open file description associated with
       aiocbp->aio_fildes.
