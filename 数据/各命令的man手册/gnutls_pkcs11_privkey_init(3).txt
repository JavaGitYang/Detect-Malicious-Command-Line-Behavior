       This function will initialize an private key structure. This
       structure can be used for accessing an underlying PKCS11 object.
       In versions of GnuTLS later than 3.5.11 the object is protected using
       locks and a single gnutls_pkcs11_privkey_t can be re-used by many
       threads. However, for performance it is recommended to utilize one
       object per key per thread.
