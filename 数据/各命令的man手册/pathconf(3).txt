       fpathconf() gets a value for the configuration option name for the
       open file descriptor fd.
       pathconf() gets a value for configuration option name for the
       filename path.
       The corresponding macros defined in <unistd.h> are minimum values; if
       an application wants to take advantage of values which may change, a
       call to fpathconf() or pathconf() can be made, which may yield more
       liberal results.
       Setting name equal to one of the following constants returns the
       following configuration options:
       _PC_LINK_MAX
              The maximum number of links to the file.  If fd or path refer
              to a directory, then the value applies to the whole directory.
              The corresponding macro is _POSIX_LINK_MAX.
       _PC_MAX_CANON
              The maximum length of a formatted input line, where fd or path
              must refer to a terminal.  The corresponding macro is
              _POSIX_MAX_CANON.
       _PC_MAX_INPUT
              The maximum length of an input line, where fd or path must
              refer to a terminal.  The corresponding macro is
              _POSIX_MAX_INPUT.
       _PC_NAME_MAX
              The maximum length of a filename in the directory path or fd
              that the process is allowed to create.  The corresponding
              macro is _POSIX_NAME_MAX.
       _PC_PATH_MAX
              The maximum length of a relative pathname when path or fd is
              the current working directory.  The corresponding macro is
              _POSIX_PATH_MAX.
       _PC_PIPE_BUF
              The maximum number of bytes that can be written atomically to
              a pipe of FIFO.  For fpathconf(), fd should refer to a pipe or
              FIFO.  For fpathconf(), path should refer to a FIFO or a
              directory; in the latter case, the returned value corresponds
              to FIFOs created in that directory.  The corresponding macro
              is _POSIX_PIPE_BUF.
       _PC_CHOWN_RESTRICTED
              This returns a positive value if the use of chown(2) and
              fchown(2) for changing a file's user ID is restricted to a
              process with appropriate privileges, and changing a file's
              group ID to a value other than the process's effective group
              ID or one of its supplementary group IDs is restricted to a
              process with appropriate privileges.  According to POSIX.1,
              this variable shall always be defined with a value other than
              -1.  The corresponding macro is _POSIX_CHOWN_RESTRICTED.
              If fd or path refers to a directory, then the return value
              applies to all files in that directory.
       _PC_NO_TRUNC
              This returns nonzero if accessing filenames longer than
              _POSIX_NAME_MAX generates an error.  The corresponding macro
              is _POSIX_NO_TRUNC.
       _PC_VDISABLE
              This returns nonzero if special character processing can be
              disabled, where fd or path must refer to a terminal.
