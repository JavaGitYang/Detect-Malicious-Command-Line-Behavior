       These functions compute the remainder of dividing x by y.  The return
       value is x-n*y, where n is the value x / y, rounded to the nearest
       integer.  If the absolute value of x-n*y is 0.5, n is chosen to be
       even.
       These functions are unaffected by the current rounding mode (see
       fenv(3)).
       The drem() function does precisely the same thing.
