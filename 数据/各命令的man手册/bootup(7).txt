       A number of different components are involved in the system boot.
       Immediately after power-up, the system BIOS will do minimal hardware
       initialization, and hand control over to a boot loader stored on a
       persistent storage device. This boot loader will then invoke an OS
       kernel from disk (or the network). In the Linux case, this kernel
       (optionally) extracts and executes an initial RAM disk image
       (initrd), such as generated by dracut(8), which looks for the root
       file system (possibly using systemd(1) for this). After the root file
       system is found and mounted, the initrd hands over control to the
       host's system manager (such as systemd(1)) stored on the OS image,
       which is then responsible for probing all remaining hardware,
       mounting all necessary file systems and spawning all configured
       services.
       On shutdown, the system manager stops all services, unmounts all file
       systems (detaching the storage technologies backing them), and then
       (optionally) jumps back into the initrd code which unmounts/detaches
       the root file system and the storage it resides on. As a last step,
       the system is powered down.
       Additional information about the system boot process may be found in
       boot(7).
