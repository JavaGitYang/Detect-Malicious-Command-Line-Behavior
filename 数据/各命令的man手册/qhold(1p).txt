       A hold is placed on a batch job by a request to the batch server that
       manages the batch job. A batch job that has one or more holds is not
       eligible for execution. The qhold utility is a user-accessible client
       of batch services that requests one or more types of hold to be
       placed on one or more batch jobs.
       The qhold utility shall place holds on those batch jobs for which a
       batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.
       The qhold utility shall place holds on batch jobs in the order in
       which their batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility. If
       the qhold utility fails to process any batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qhold utility shall place holds on each batch job by sending a
       Hold Job Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
       The qhold utility shall not exit until holds have been placed on the
       batch job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
       job_identifier.
