       The fnmatch() function shall match patterns as described in the Shell
       and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 2.13.1, Patterns
       Matching a Single Character and Section 2.13.2, Patterns Matching
       Multiple Characters.  It checks the string specified by the string
       argument to see if it matches the pattern specified by the pattern
       argument.
       The flags argument shall modify the interpretation of pattern and
       string.  It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of zero or more of the flags
       defined in <fnmatch.h>.  If the FNM_PATHNAME flag is set in flags,
       then a <slash> character ('/') in string shall be explicitly matched
       by a <slash> in pattern; it shall not be matched by either the
       <asterisk> or <question-mark> special characters, nor by a bracket
       expression. If the FNM_PATHNAME flag is not set, the <slash>
       character shall be treated as an ordinary character.
       If FNM_NOESCAPE is not set in flags, a <backslash> character in
       pattern followed by any other character shall match that second
       character in string.  In particular, "\\" shall match a <backslash>
       in string.  If FNM_NOESCAPE is set, a <backslash> character shall be
       treated as an ordinary character.
       If FNM_PERIOD is set in flags, then a leading <period> ('.')  in
       string shall match a <period> in pattern; as described by rule 2 in
       the Shell and Utilities volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 2.13.3,
       Patterns Used for Filename Expansion where the location of
       ``leading'' is indicated by the value of FNM_PATHNAME:
        *  If FNM_PATHNAME is set, a <period> is ``leading'' if it is the
           first character in string or if it immediately follows a <slash>.
        *  If FNM_PATHNAME is not set, a <period> is ``leading'' only if it
           is the first character of string.
       If FNM_PERIOD is not set, then no special restrictions are placed on
       matching a period.
