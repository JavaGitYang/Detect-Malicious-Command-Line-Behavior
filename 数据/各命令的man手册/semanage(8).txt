       semanage is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy
       without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy
       sources.  This includes the mapping from Linux usernames to SELinux
       user identities (which controls the initial security context assigned
       to Linux users when they login and bounds their authorized role set)
       as well as security context mappings for various kinds of objects,
       such as network ports, interfaces, infiniband pkeys and endports, and
       nodes (hosts) as well as the file context mapping. See the EXAMPLES
       section below for some examples of common usage.  Note that the
       semanage login command deals with the mapping from Linux usernames
       (logins) to SELinux user identities, while the semanage user command
       deals with the mapping from SELinux user identities to authorized
       role sets.  In most cases, only the former mapping needs to be
       adjusted by the administrator; the latter is principally defined by
       the base policy and usually does not require modification.
