       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fgetwc() function shall obtain the next character (if present)
       from the input stream pointed to by stream, convert that to the
       corresponding wide-character code, and advance the associated file
       position indicator for the stream (if defined).
       If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position
       indicator for the stream is unspecified.
       The fgetwc() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetwc(), fgetws(), fwscanf(), getwc(), getwchar(),
       vfwscanf(), vwscanf(), or wscanf() using stream that returns data not
       supplied by a prior call to ungetwc().
       The fgetwc() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
