       After calling the auparse_normalize function, you will probably want
       to access the audit event data. These function provide access to the
       results of the normalization. There are 2 kinds of function, metadata
       and positioning.
       The metadata functions all return a pointer to a string that
       describes something about the event. This data does not live inside
       the event but is kept in lookup tables inside the auparse library.
       The positioning function are different in that they move the internal
       cursor of auparse to the record and field that contains the
       information you want. You then use field accessor functions to
       retrieve the values.
