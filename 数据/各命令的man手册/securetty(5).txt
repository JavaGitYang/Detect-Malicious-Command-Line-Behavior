       The file /etc/securetty contains the names of terminals (one per
       line, without leading /dev/) which are considered secure for the
       transmission of certain authentication tokens.
       It is used by (some versions of) login(1) to restrict the terminals
       on which root is allowed to login.  See login.defs(5) if you use the
       shadow suite.
       On PAM enabled systems, it is used for the same purpose by
       pam_securetty(8) to restrict the terminals on which empty passwords
       are accepted.
