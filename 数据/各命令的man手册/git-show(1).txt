       Shows one or more objects (blobs, trees, tags and commits).
       For commits it shows the log message and textual diff. It also
       presents the merge commit in a special format as produced by git
       diff-tree --cc.
       For tags, it shows the tag message and the referenced objects.
       For trees, it shows the names (equivalent to git ls-tree with
       --name-only).
       For plain blobs, it shows the plain contents.
       The command takes options applicable to the git diff-tree command to
       control how the changes the commit introduces are shown.
       This manual page describes only the most frequently used options.
