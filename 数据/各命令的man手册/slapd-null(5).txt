       The Null backend to slapd(8) is surely the most useful part of slapd:
       - Searches return success but no entries.
       - Compares return compareFalse.
       - Updates return success (unless readonly is on) but do nothing.
       - Binds other than as the rootdn fail unless the database option
       "bind on" is given.
       - The slapadd(8) and slapcat(8) tools are equally exciting.
       Inspired by the /dev/null device.
