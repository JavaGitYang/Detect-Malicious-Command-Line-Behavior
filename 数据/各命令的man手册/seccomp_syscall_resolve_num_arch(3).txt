       The seccomp_syscall_resolve_name(),
       seccomp_syscall_resolve_name_arch(), and
       seccomp_syscall_resolve_name_rewrite() functions resolve the commonly
       used syscall name to the syscall number used by the kernel and the
       rest of the libseccomp API, with
       seccomp_syscall_resolve_name_rewrite() rewriting the syscall number
       for architectures that modify the syscall.  Syscall rewriting
       typically happens in case of a multiplexed syscall, like
       socketcall(2) or ipc(2) on x86.  seccomp_syscall_resolve_num_arch()
       function resolves the syscall number used by the kernel to the
       commonly used syscall name.
       The caller is responsible for freeing the returned string from
       seccomp_syscall_resolve_num_arch().
