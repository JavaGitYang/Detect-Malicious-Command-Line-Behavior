       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       These functions shall return the integral value (represented as a
       double) nearest x in the direction of the current rounding mode. The
       current rounding mode is implementation-defined.
       If the current rounding mode rounds toward negative infinity, then
       rint() shall be equivalent to floor(3p).  If the current rounding
       mode rounds toward positive infinity, then rint() shall be equivalent
       to ceil(3p).  If the current rounding mode rounds towards zero, then
       rint() shall be equivalent to trunc(3p).  If the current rounding
       mode rounds towards nearest, then rint() differs from round(3p) in
       that halfway cases are rounded to even rather than away from zero.
       These functions differ from the nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and
       nearbyintl() functions only in that they may raise the inexact
       floating-point exception if the result differs in value from the
       argument.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
