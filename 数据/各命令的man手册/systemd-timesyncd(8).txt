       systemd-timesyncd is a system service that may be used to synchronize
       the local system clock with a remote Network Time Protocol server. It
       also saves the local time to disk every time the clock has been
       synchronized and uses this to possibly advance the system realtime
       clock on subsequent reboots to ensure it monotonically advances even
       if the system lacks a battery-buffered RTC chip.
       The systemd-timesyncd service specifically implements only SNTP. This
       minimalistic service will set the system clock for large offsets or
       slowly adjust it for smaller deltas. More complex use cases are not
       covered by systemd-timesyncd.
       The NTP servers contacted are determined from the global settings in
       timesyncd.conf(5), the per-link static settings in .network files,
       and the per-link dynamic settings received over DHCP. See
       systemd.network(5) for more details.
       timedatectl(1)'s set-ntp command may be used to enable and start, or
       disable and stop this service.
