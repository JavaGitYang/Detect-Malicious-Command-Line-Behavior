       The nroff script emulates the nroff command using groff.  Only ascii,
       latin1, utf8, and cp1047 are devices accepted by nroff to select the
       output encoding emitted by grotty, groff's TTY output device.  If
       neither the GROFF_TYPESETTER environment variable nor the -T command-
       line option (which overrides the environment variable) specifies a
       (valid) device, nroff checks the current locale to select a default
       output device.  It first tries the locale program, then the
       environment variables LC_ALL, LC_CTYPE, and LANG, and finally the
       LESSCHARSET environment variable.
       The -h and -c options are equivalent to grotty's options -h (using
       tabs in the output) and -c (using the old output scheme instead of
       SGR escape sequences).  The -d, -C, -i, -M, -m, -n, -o, -r, -w, and
       -W options have the effect described in troff(1).  In addition, nroff
       silently ignores the options -e, -q, and -s (which are not
       implemented in troff).  Options -p (pic), -t (tbl), -S (safer), and
       -U (unsafe) are passed to groff.  -v and --version show the version
       number, --help prints a help message.
