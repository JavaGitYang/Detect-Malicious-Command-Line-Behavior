       The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files contain operating
       system identification data.
       The basic file format of os-release is a newline-separated list of
       environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is
       possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however,
       beyond mere variable assignments, no shell features are supported
       (this means variable expansion is explicitly not supported), allowing
       applications to read the file without implementing a shell compatible
       execution engine. Variable assignment values must be enclosed in
       double or single quotes if they include spaces, semicolons or other
       special characters outside of A–Z, a–z, 0–9. Shell special characters
       ("$", quotes, backslash, backtick) must be escaped with backslashes,
       following shell style. All strings should be in UTF-8 format, and
       non-printable characters should not be used. It is not supported to
       concatenate multiple individually quoted strings. Lines beginning
       with "#" shall be ignored as comments.
       The file /etc/os-release takes precedence over /usr/lib/os-release.
       Applications should check for the former, and exclusively use its
       data if it exists, and only fall back to /usr/lib/os-release if it is
       missing. Applications should not read data from both files at the
       same time.  /usr/lib/os-release is the recommended place to store OS
       release information as part of vendor trees.  /etc/os-release should
       be a relative symlink to /usr/lib/os-release, to provide
       compatibility with applications only looking at /etc. A relative
       symlink instead of an absolute symlink is necessary to avoid breaking
       the link in a chroot or initrd environment such as dracut.
       os-release contains data that is defined by the operating system
       vendor and should generally not be changed by the administrator.
       As this file only encodes names and identifiers it should not be
       localized.
       The /etc/os-release and /usr/lib/os-release files might be symlinks
       to other files, but it is important that the file is available from
       earliest boot on, and hence must be located on the root file system.
       For a longer rationale for os-release please refer to the
       Announcement of /etc/os-release[1].
