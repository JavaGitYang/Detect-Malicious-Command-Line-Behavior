       Read text, such as commit messages, notes, tags and branch
       descriptions, from the standard input and clean it in the manner used
       by Git.
       With no arguments, this will:
       路   remove trailing whitespace from all lines
       路   collapse multiple consecutive empty lines into one empty line
       路   remove empty lines from the beginning and end of the input
       路   add a missing \n to the last line if necessary.
       In the case where the input consists entirely of whitespace
       characters, no output will be produced.
       NOTE: This is intended for cleaning metadata, prefer the
       --whitespace=fix mode of git-apply(1) for correcting whitespace of
       patches or files in the repository.
