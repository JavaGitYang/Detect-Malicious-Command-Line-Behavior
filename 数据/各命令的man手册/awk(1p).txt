       The awk utility shall execute programs written in the awk programming
       language, which is specialized for textual data manipulation. An awk
       program is a sequence of patterns and corresponding actions. When
       input is read that matches a pattern, the action associated with that
       pattern is carried out.
       Input shall be interpreted as a sequence of records. By default, a
       record is a line, less its terminating <newline>, but this can be
       changed by using the RS built-in variable. Each record of input shall
       be matched in turn against each pattern in the program. For each
       pattern matched, the associated action shall be executed.
       The awk utility shall interpret each input record as a sequence of
       fields where, by default, a field is a string of non-<blank>
       non-<newline> characters. This default <blank> and <newline> field
       delimiter can be changed by using the FS built-in variable or the âˆ’F
       sepstring option. The awk utility shall denote the first field in a
       record $1, the second $2, and so on. The symbol $0 shall refer to the
       entire record; setting any other field causes the re-evaluation of
       $0. Assigning to $0 shall reset the values of all other fields and
       the NF built-in variable.
