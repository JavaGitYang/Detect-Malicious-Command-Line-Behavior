       getsockcreatecon() retrieves the context used for creating a new
       labeled network socket.  This returned context should be freed with
       freecon(3) if non-NULL.  getsockcreatecon() sets *con to NULL if no
       sockcreate context has been explicitly set by the program (i.e. using
       the default policy behavior).
       setsockcreatecon() sets the context used for creating a new labeled
       network sockets NULL can be passed to setsockcreatecon() to reset to
       the default policy behavior.  The sockcreate context is automatically
       reset after the next execve(2), so a program doesn't need to
       explicitly sanitize it upon startup.
       setsockcreatecon() can be applied prior to library functions that
       internally perform an file creation, in order to set an file context
       on the objects.
       getsockcreatecon_raw() and setsockcreatecon_raw() behave identically
       to their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context translation.
       Note: Signal handlers that perform a setsockcreatecon() must take
       care to save, reset, and restore the sockcreate context to avoid
       unexpected behavior.
       Note: Contexts are thread specific.
