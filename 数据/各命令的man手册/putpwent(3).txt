               char    *pw_name;        /* username */
               char    *pw_passwd;      /* user password */
               uid_t    pw_uid;         /* user ID */
               gid_t    pw_gid;         /* group ID */
               char    *pw_gecos;       /* real name */
               char    *pw_dir;         /* home directory */
               char    *pw_shell;       /* shell program */
           };
