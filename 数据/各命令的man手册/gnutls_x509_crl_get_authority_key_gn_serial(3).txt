       This function will return the X.509 authority key identifier when
       stored as a general name (authorityCertIssuer) and serial number.
       Because more than one general names might be stored
        seq can be used as a counter to request them all until
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
