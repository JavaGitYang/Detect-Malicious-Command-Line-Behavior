       Invoked by git send-pack and updates the repository with the
       information fed from the remote end.
       This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The UI
       for the protocol is on the git send-pack side, and the program pair
       is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository. For pull
       operations, see git-fetch-pack(1).
       The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
       (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the local
       end git-receive-pack runs, but to the user who is sitting at the
       send-pack end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)
       There are other real-world examples of using update and post-update
       hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.
       git-receive-pack honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
       option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if they
       are not fast-forwards.
       A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak its
       behavior, see git-config(1).
