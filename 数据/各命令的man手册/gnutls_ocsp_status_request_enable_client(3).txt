       This function is to be used by clients to request OCSP response from
       the server, using the "status_request" TLS extension.  Only OCSP
       status type is supported.
       Previous versions of GnuTLS supported setting  responder_id and
        extensions fields, but due to the difficult semantics of the
       parameter usage, and other issues, this support was removed since
       3.6.0 and these parameters must be set to NULL.
