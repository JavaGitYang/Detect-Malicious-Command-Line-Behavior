       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The nextafter(), nextafterf(), and nextafterl() functions shall
       compute the next representable floating-point value following x in
       the direction of y.  Thus, if y is less than x, nextafter() shall
       return the largest representable floating-point number less than x.
       The nextafter(), nextafterf(), and nextafterl() functions shall
       return y if x equals y.
       The nexttoward(), nexttowardf(), and nexttowardl() functions shall be
       equivalent to the corresponding nextafter() functions, except that
       the second parameter shall have type long double and the functions
       shall return y converted to the type of the function if x equals y.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
