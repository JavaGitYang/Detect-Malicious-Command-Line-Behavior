       systemd-tmpfiles creates, deletes, and cleans up volatile and
       temporary files and directories, based on the configuration file
       format and location specified in tmpfiles.d(5).
       If invoked with no arguments, it applies all directives from all
       configuration files. If one or more absolute filenames are passed on
       the command line, only the directives in these files are applied. If
       "-" is specified instead of a filename, directives are read from
       standard input. If only the basename of a configuration file is
       specified, all configuration directories as specified in
       tmpfiles.d(5) are searched for a matching file.
