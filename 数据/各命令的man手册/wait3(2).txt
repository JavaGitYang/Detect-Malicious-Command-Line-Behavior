       These functions are nonstandard; in new programs, the use of
       waitpid(2) or waitid(2) is preferable.
       The wait3() and wait4() system calls are similar to waitpid(2), but
       additionally return resource usage information about the child in the
       structure pointed to by rusage.
       Other than the use of the rusage argument, the following wait3()
       call:
           wait3(wstatus, options, rusage);
       is equivalent to:
           waitpid(-1, wstatus, options);
       Similarly, the following wait4() call:
           wait4(pid, wstatus, options, rusage);
       is equivalent to:
           waitpid(pid, wstatus, options);
       In other words, wait3() waits of any child, while wait4() can be used
       to select a specific child, or children, on which to wait.  See
       wait(2) for further details.
       If rusage is not NULL, the struct rusage to which it points will be
       filled with accounting information about the child.  See getrusage(2)
       for details.
