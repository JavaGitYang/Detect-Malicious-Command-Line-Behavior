       lxc-stop reboots, cleanly shuts down, or kills all the processes
       inside the container. By default, it will request a clean shutdown of
       the container by sending lxc.signal.halt (defaults to SIGPWR) to the
       container's init process, waiting up to 60 seconds for the container
       to exit, and then returning. If the container fails to cleanly exit
       in 60 seconds, it will be sent the lxc.signal.stop (defaults to
       SIGKILL) to force it to shut down. A request to reboot will send the
       lxc.signal.reboot (defaults to SIGINT) to the container's init
       process.
       The [-W], [-r], [-k] and [--nokill] options specify the action to
       perform.  [-W] indicates that after performing the specified action,
       lxc-stop should immediately exit, while [-t TIMEOUT] specifies the
       maximum amount of time to wait for the container to complete the
       shutdown or reboot.
