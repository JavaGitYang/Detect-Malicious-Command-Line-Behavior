       This optional file controls the color to be associated to the context
       components associated to the raw context passed by
       selinux_raw_context_to_color(3), when context related information is
       to be displayed in color by an SELinux-aware application.
       selinux_raw_context_to_color(3) obtains this color information from
       the active policy secolor.conf file as returned by
       selinux_colors_path(3).
