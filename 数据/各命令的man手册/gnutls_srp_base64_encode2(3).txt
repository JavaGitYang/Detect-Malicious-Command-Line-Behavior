       This function will convert the given data to printable data, using
       the base64 encoding.  This is the encoding used in SRP password
       files.  This function will allocate the required memory to hold the
       encoded data.
       You should use gnutls_free() to free the returned data.
       Warning!  This base64 encoding is not the "standard" encoding, so do
       not use it for non-SRP purposes.
