       The getcwd() function shall place an absolute pathname of the current
       working directory in the array pointed to by buf, and return buf.
       The pathname shall contain no components that are dot or dot-dot, or
       are symbolic links.
       If there are multiple pathnames that getcwd() could place in the
       array pointed to by buf, one beginning with a single <slash>
       character and one or more beginning with two <slash> characters, then
       getcwd() shall place the pathname beginning with a single <slash>
       character in the array. The pathname shall not contain any
       unnecessary <slash> characters after the leading one or two <slash>
       characters.
       The size argument is the size in bytes of the character array pointed
       to by the buf argument. If buf is a null pointer, the behavior of
       getcwd() is unspecified.
