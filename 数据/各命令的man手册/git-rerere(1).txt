       In a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches, the
       developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over and over
       again until the topic branches are done (either merged to the
       "release" branch, or sent out and accepted upstream).
       This command assists the developer in this process by recording
       conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve results
       on the initial manual merge, and applying previously recorded hand
       resolutions to their corresponding automerge results.
           Note
           You need to set the configuration variable rerere.enabled in
           order to enable this command.
