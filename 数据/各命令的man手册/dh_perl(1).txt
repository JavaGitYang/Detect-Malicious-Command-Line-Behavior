       dh_perl is a debhelper program that is responsible for generating the
       ${perl:Depends} substitutions and adding them to substvars files.
       The program will look at Perl scripts and modules in your package,
       and will use this information to generate a dependency on perl or
       perlapi. The dependency will be substituted into your package's
       control file wherever you place the token ${perl:Depends}.
       dh_perl also cleans up empty directories that MakeMaker can generate
       when installing Perl modules.
