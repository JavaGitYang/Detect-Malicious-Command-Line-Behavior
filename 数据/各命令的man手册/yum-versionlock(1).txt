       yum-versionlock(1) is a Yum plugin that takes a set of name/versions
       for packages and excludes all other versions of those packages
       (including optionally following obsoletes).  This allows you to
       protect packages from being updated by newer versions.
       The plugin provides a command "versionlock" which allows you to view
       and edit the list of locked packages easily.

       given wildcards.   yum versionlock exclude <package-wildcard>...
       Add a exclude (within versionlock) for the latest versions of the
       packages in the available repos. matching the given wildcards.   yum
       versionlock list

       <entry-wildcard>...
