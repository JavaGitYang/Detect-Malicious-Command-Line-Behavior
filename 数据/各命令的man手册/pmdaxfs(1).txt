       pmdaxfs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
       performance metrics describing the state of the XFS filesystem from
       the Linux kernel.
       The xfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information about metadata
       buffer usage, the journal, btree operations, inode operations,
       extended attributes, directories, quotas, read and write operation
       counts and of course throughput.
       The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all counters to
       zero using pmstore(1) with the xfs.control.reset metric.
       A brief description of the pmdaxfs command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named xfs.log
            is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdaxfs is
            started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
