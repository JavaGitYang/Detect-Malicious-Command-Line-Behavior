       Given a list in namelist containing numpmid full pathnames for
       performance metrics from a Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS),
       pmLookupName returns the list of associated Performance Metric
       Identifiers (PMIDs) via pmidlist.
       The result from pmLookupName depends on the presence of any lookup
       failures, their severity and the number of metrics being looked up.
       1.  If there are no lookup failures, the return value will be
           numpmid.
       2.  If a fatal error is encountered, the return value will be less
           than 0.  For example PM_ERR_TOOSMALL, PM_ERR_NOPMNS or
           PM_ERR_IPC.
       3.  If numpmid is greater than one and non-fatal error(s) are
           encountered, the return value is the number of metric names that
           have successfully been looked up (greater than or equal to zero
           and less than or equal to numpmid).
       4.  If numpmid is one and a non-fatal error is encountered, the
           return value is the error code (less than zero).
       When errors are encountered, any metrics that cannot be looked up
       result in the corresponding element of pmidlist being set to
       PM_ID_NULL.
       The slightly convoluted error protocol allows bulk lookups, then
       probing for more error details in the case of a specific failure, as
       shown in the EXAMPLES section below.
       Note that the error protocol guarantees there is a 1:1 relationship
       between the elements of namelist and pmidlist, hence both lists
       contain exactly numpmid elements.  For this reason, the caller is
       expected to have pre-allocated a suitably sized array for pmidlist.
