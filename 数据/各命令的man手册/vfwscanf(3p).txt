       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The vfwscanf(), vswscanf(), and vwscanf() functions shall be
       equivalent to the fwscanf(), swscanf(), and wscanf() functions,
       respectively, except that instead of being called with a variable
       number of arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined
       in the <stdarg.h> header. These functions shall not invoke the va_end
       macro. As these functions invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap
       after the return is unspecified.
