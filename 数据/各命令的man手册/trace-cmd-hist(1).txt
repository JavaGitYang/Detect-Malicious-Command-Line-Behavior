       The trace-cmd(1) hist displays a histogram form from the trace.dat
       file. Instead of showing the events as they were ordered, it creates
       a histogram that can be displayed per task or for all tasks where the
       most common events appear first. It uses the function tracer and call
       stacks that it finds to try to put together a call graph of the
       events.
