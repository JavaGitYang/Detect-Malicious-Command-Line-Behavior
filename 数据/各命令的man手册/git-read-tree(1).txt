       Reads the tree information given by <tree-ish> into the index, but
       does not actually update any of the files it "caches". (see:
       git-checkout-index(1))
       Optionally, it can merge a tree into the index, perform a
       fast-forward (i.e. 2-way) merge, or a 3-way merge, with the -m flag.
       When used with -m, the -u flag causes it to also update the files in
       the work tree with the result of the merge.
       Trivial merges are done by git read-tree itself. Only conflicting
       paths will be in unmerged state when git read-tree returns.
