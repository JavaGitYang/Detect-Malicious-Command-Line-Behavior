       xfs_freeze suspends and resumes access to an XFS filesystem (see
       xfs(5)).
       xfs_freeze halts new access to the filesystem and creates a stable
       image on disk.  xfs_freeze is intended to be used with volume
       managers and hardware RAID devices that support the creation of
       snapshots.
       The mount-point argument is the pathname of the directory where the
       filesystem is mounted.  The filesystem must be mounted to be frozen
       (see mount(8)).
       The -f flag requests the specified XFS filesystem to be frozen from
       new modifications.  When this is selected, all ongoing transactions
       in the filesystem are allowed to complete, new write system calls are
       halted, other calls which modify the filesystem are halted, and all
       dirty data, metadata, and log information are written to disk.  Any
       process attempting to write to the frozen filesystem will block
       waiting for the filesystem to be unfrozen.
       Note that even after freezing, the on-disk filesystem can contain
       information on files that are still in the process of unlinking.
       These files will not be unlinked until the filesystem is unfrozen or
       a clean mount of the snapshot is complete.
       The -u flag is used to un-freeze the filesystem and allow operations
       to continue.  Any filesystem modifications that were blocked by the
       freeze are unblocked and allowed to complete.
       The -V flag prints the version number and exits.
       Unless -V is specified, one of -f or -u must be supplied to
       xfs_freeze.
