       fuser displays the PIDs of processes using the specified files or
       file systems.  In the default display mode, each file name is
       followed by a letter denoting the type of access:
              c      current directory.
              e      executable being run.
              f      open file.  f is omitted in default display mode.
              F      open file for writing.  F is omitted in default display
                     mode.
              r      root directory.
              m      mmap'ed file or shared library.
              .      Placeholder, omitted in default display mode.
       fuser returns a non-zero return code if none of the specified files
       is accessed or in case of a fatal error.  If at least one access has
       been found, fuser returns zero.
       In order to look up processes using TCP and UDP sockets, the
       corresponding name space has to be selected with the -n option. By
       default fuser will look in both IPv6 and IPv4 sockets.  To change the
       default, behavior, use the -4 and -6 options.  The socket(s) can be
       specified by the local and remote port, and the remote address.  All
       fields are optional, but commas in front of missing fields must be
       present:
       [lcl_port][,[rmt_host][,[rmt_port]]]
       Either symbolic or numeric values can be used for IP addresses and
       port numbers.
       fuser outputs only the PIDs to stdout, everything else is sent to
       stderr.
