       This function will allow you to get the name indication (if any), a
       client has sent.  The name indication may be any of the enumeration
       gnutls_server_name_type_t.
       If  type is GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, then this function is to be used by
       servers that support virtual hosting, and the data will be a null
       terminated IDNA ACE string (prior to GnuTLS 3.4.0 it was a UTF-8
       string).
       If  data has not enough size to hold the server name
       GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER is returned, and  data_length will hold
       the required size.
        indx is used to retrieve more than one server names (if sent by the
       client).  The first server name has an index of 0, the second 1 and
       so on.  If no name with the given index exists
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
