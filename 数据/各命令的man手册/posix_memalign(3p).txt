       The posix_memalign() function shall allocate size bytes aligned on a
       boundary specified by alignment, and shall return a pointer to the
       allocated memory in memptr.  The value of alignment shall be a power
       of two multiple of sizeof(void *).
       Upon successful completion, the value pointed to by memptr shall be a
       multiple of alignment.
       If the size of the space requested is 0, the behavior is
       implementation-defined; the value returned in memptr shall be either
       a null pointer or a unique pointer.
       The free() function shall deallocate memory that has previously been
       allocated by posix_memalign().
