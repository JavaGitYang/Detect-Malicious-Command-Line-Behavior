       The umask utility shall set the file mode creation mask of the
       current shell execution environment (see Section 2.12, Shell
       Execution Environment) to the value specified by the mask operand.
       This mask shall affect the initial value of the file permission bits
       of subsequently created files. If umask is called in a subshell or
       separate utility execution environment, such as one of the following:
           (umask 002)
           nohup umask ...
           find . âˆ’exec umask ... \;
       it shall not affect the file mode creation mask of the caller's
       environment.
       If the mask operand is not specified, the umask utility shall write
       to standard output the value of the file mode creation mask of the
       invoking process.
