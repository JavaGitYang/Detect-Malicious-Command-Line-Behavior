       The msgrcv() function operates on XSI message queues (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 3.225, Message Queue).
       It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
       realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The msgrcv() function shall read a message from the queue associated
       with the message queue identifier specified by msqid and place it in
       the user-defined buffer pointed to by msgp.
       The application shall ensure that the argument msgp points to a user-
       defined buffer that contains first a field of type long specifying
       the type of the message, and then a data portion that holds the data
       bytes of the message. The structure below is an example of what this
       user-defined buffer might look like:
           struct mymsg {
               long    mtype;     /* Message type. */
               char    mtext[1];  /* Message text. */
           }
       The structure member mtype is the received message's type as
       specified by the sending process.
       The structure member mtext is the text of the message.
       The argument msgsz specifies the size in bytes of mtext.  The
       received message shall be truncated to msgsz bytes if it is larger
       than msgsz and (msgflg & MSG_NOERROR) is non-zero.  The truncated
       part of the message shall be lost and no indication of the truncation
       shall be given to the calling process.
       If the value of msgsz is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the result is
       implementation-defined.
       The argument msgtyp specifies the type of message requested as
       follows:
        *  If msgtyp is 0, the first message on the queue shall be received.
        *  If msgtyp is greater than 0, the first message of type msgtyp
           shall be received.
        *  If msgtyp is less than 0, the first message of the lowest type
           that is less than or equal to the absolute value of msgtyp shall
           be received.
       The argument msgflg specifies the action to be taken if a message of
       the desired type is not on the queue. These are as follows:
        *  If (msgflg & IPC_NOWAIT) is non-zero, the calling thread shall
           return immediately with a return value of −1 and errno set to
           [ENOMSG].
        *  If (msgflg & IPC_NOWAIT) is 0, the calling thread shall suspend
           execution until one of the following occurs:
           --  A message of the desired type is placed on the queue.
           --  The message queue identifier msqid is removed from the
               system; when this occurs, errno shall be set to [EIDRM] and
               −1 shall be returned.
           --  The calling thread receives a signal that is to be caught; in
               this case a message is not received and the calling thread
               resumes execution in the manner prescribed in sigaction(3p).
       Upon successful completion, the following actions are taken with
       respect to the data structure associated with msqid:
        *  msg_qnum shall be decremented by 1.
        *  msg_lrpid shall be set to the process ID of the calling process.
        *  msg_rtime shall be set to the current time, as described in
           Section 2.7.1, IPC General Description.
