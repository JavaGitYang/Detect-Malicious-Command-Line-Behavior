       lpoptions displays or sets printer options and defaults.  If no
       printer is specified using the -p option, the default printer is used
       as described in lp(1).
       If no -l, -o, or -r options are specified, the current options are
       reported on the standard output.
       Options set with the lpoptions command are used by the lp(1) and
       lpr(1) commands when submitting jobs.
       When run by the root user, lpoptions gets and sets default options
       and instances for all users in the /etc/cups/lpoptions file.
       Otherwise, the per-user defaults are managed in the ~/.cups/lpoptions
       file.
