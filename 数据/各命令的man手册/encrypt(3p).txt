       The encrypt() function shall provide access to an implementation-
       defined encoding algorithm. The key generated by setkey() is used to
       encrypt the string block with encrypt().
       The block argument to encrypt() shall be an array of length 64 bytes
       containing only the bytes with values of 0 and 1. The array is
       modified in place to a similar array using the key set by setkey().
       If edflag is 0, the argument is encoded. If edflag is 1, the argument
       may be decoded (see the APPLICATION USAGE section); if the argument
       is not decoded, errno shall be set to [ENOSYS].
       The encrypt() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful. An application wishing to check for error situations
       should set errno to 0 before calling encrypt().  If errno is non-zero
       on return, an error has occurred.
       The encrypt() function need not be thread-safe.
