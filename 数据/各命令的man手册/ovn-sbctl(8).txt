       The ovn-sbctl program configures the OVN_Southbound database by
       providing a high-level interface to its configuration database.  See
       ovn-sb(5) for comprehensive documentation of the database schema.
       ovn-sbctl connects to an ovsdb-server process that maintains an
       OVN_Southbound configuration database.  Using this connection, it
       queries and possibly applies changes to the database, depending on
       the supplied commands.
       ovn-sbctl can perform any number of commands in a single run,
       implemented as a single atomic transaction against the database.
       The ovn-sbctl command line begins with global options (see OPTIONS
       below for details).  The global options are followed by one or more
       commands.  Each command should begin with -- by itself as a command-
       line argument, to separate it from the following commands.  (The --
       before the first command is optional.)  The command itself starts
       with command-specific options, if any, followed by the command name
       and any arguments.
