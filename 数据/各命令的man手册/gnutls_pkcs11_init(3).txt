       This function will initialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls. It
       will read configuration files if GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO is used or
       allow you to independently load PKCS 11 modules using
       gnutls_pkcs11_add_provider() if GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_MANUAL is
       specified.
       You don't need to call this function since GnuTLS 3.3.0 because it is
       being called during the first request PKCS 11 operation. That call
       will assume the GNUTLS_PKCS11_FLAG_AUTO flag. If another flags are
       required then it must be called independently prior to any PKCS 11
       operation.
