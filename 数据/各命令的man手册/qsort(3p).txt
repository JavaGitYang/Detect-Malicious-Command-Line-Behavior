       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The qsort() function shall sort an array of nel objects, the initial
       element of which is pointed to by base.  The size of each object, in
       bytes, is specified by the width argument. If the nel argument has
       the value zero, the comparison function pointed to by compar shall
       not be called and no rearrangement shall take place.
       The application shall ensure that the comparison function pointed to
       by compar does not alter the contents of the array. The
       implementation may reorder elements of the array between calls to the
       comparison function, but shall not alter the contents of any
       individual element.
       When the same objects (consisting of width bytes, irrespective of
       their current positions in the array) are passed more than once to
       the comparison function, the results shall be consistent with one
       another.  That is, they shall define a total ordering on the array.
       The contents of the array shall be sorted in ascending order
       according to a comparison function. The compar argument is a pointer
       to the comparison function, which is called with two arguments that
       point to the elements being compared. The application shall ensure
       that the function returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater
       than 0, if the first argument is considered respectively less than,
       equal to, or greater than the second. If two members compare as
       equal, their order in the sorted array is unspecified.
