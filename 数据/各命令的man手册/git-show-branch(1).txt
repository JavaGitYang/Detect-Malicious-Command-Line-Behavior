       Shows the commit ancestry graph starting from the commits named with
       <rev>s or <globs>s (or all refs under refs/heads and/or refs/tags)
       semi-visually.
       It cannot show more than 29 branches and commits at a time.
       It uses showbranch.default multi-valued configuration items if no
       <rev> or <glob> is given on the command line.
