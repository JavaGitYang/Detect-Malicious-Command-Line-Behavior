       runlevel prints the previous and current SysV runlevel if they are
       known.
       The two runlevel characters are separated by a single space
       character. If a runlevel cannot be determined, N is printed instead.
       If neither can be determined, the word "unknown" is printed.
       Unless overridden in the environment, this will check the utmp
       database for recent runlevel changes.
