       The posix_spawnattr_getpgroup() function shall obtain the value of
       the spawn-pgroup attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The posix_spawnattr_setpgroup() function shall set the spawn-pgroup
       attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.
       The spawn-pgroup attribute represents the process group to be joined
       by the new process image in a spawn operation (if
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The
       default value of this attribute shall be zero.
