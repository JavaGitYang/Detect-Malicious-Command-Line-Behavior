       This function will associate the given callbacks with the
       gnutls_privkey_t type. At least one of the callbacks must be
       non-null. If a deinitialization function is provided then flags is
       assumed to contain GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_IMPORT_AUTO_RELEASE.
       Note that in contrast with the signing function of
       gnutls_privkey_import_ext3(), the signing functions provided to this
       function take explicitly the signature algorithm as parameter and
       different functions are provided to sign the data and hashes.
       The  sign_hash_fn is to be called to sign pre-hashed data. The input
       to the callback is the output of the hash (such as SHA256)
       corresponding to the signature algorithm. For RSA PKCS1 signatures,
       the signature algorithm can be set to GNUTLS_SIGN_RSA_RAW, and in
       that case the data should be handled as if they were an RSA PKCS1
       DigestInfo structure.
       The  sign_data_fn is to be called to sign data. The input data will
       be he data to be signed (and hashed), with the provided signature
       algorithm. This function is to be used for signature algorithms like
       Ed25519 which cannot take pre-hashed data as input.
       When both  sign_data_fn and  sign_hash_fn functions are provided they
       must be able to operate on all the supported signature algorithms,
       unless prohibited by the type of the algorithm (e.g., as with
       Ed25519).
       The  info_fn must provide information on the signature algorithms
       supported by this private key, and should support the flags
       GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_PK_ALGO and GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_INFO_HAVE_SIGN_ALGO.
       It must return -1 on unknown flags.
