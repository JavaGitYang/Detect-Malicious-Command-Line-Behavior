       The ldap_err2string() routine provides short description of the
       various codes returned by routines in this library.  The returned
       string is a pointer to a static area that should not be modified.
       These codes are either negative, indicating an API error code;
       positive, indicating an LDAP resultCode other than ´success' (0), or
       - zero, indicating both successful use of the API and the LDAP
       resultCode ´success' (0).
       The code associated with an LDAP session is accessible using
       ldap_get_option(3) and ldap_set_option(3) with the
       LDAP_OPT_RESULT_CODE option (previously called
       LDAP_OPT_ERROR_NUMBER).
