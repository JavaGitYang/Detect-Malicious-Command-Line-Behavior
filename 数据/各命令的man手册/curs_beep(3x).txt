       The beep and flash routines are used to alert the terminal user.  The
       routine beep sounds an audible alarm on the terminal, if possible;
       otherwise it flashes the screen (visible bell).  The routine flash
       flashes the screen, and if that is not possible, sounds the alert.
       If neither alert is possible, nothing happens.  Nearly all terminals
       have an audible alert (bell or beep), but only some can flash the
       screen.
