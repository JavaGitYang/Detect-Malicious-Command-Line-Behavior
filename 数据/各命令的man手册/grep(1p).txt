       The grep utility shall search the input files, selecting lines
       matching one or more patterns; the types of patterns are controlled
       by the options specified. The patterns are specified by the −e
       option, −f option, or the pattern_list operand. The pattern_list's
       value shall consist of one or more patterns separated by <newline>
       characters; the pattern_file's contents shall consist of one or more
       patterns terminated by a <newline> character. By default, an input
       line shall be selected if any pattern, treated as an entire basic
       regular expression (BRE) as described in the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 9.3, Basic Regular Expressions, matches any
       part of the line excluding the terminating <newline>; a null BRE
       shall match every line. By default, each selected input line shall be
       written to the standard output.
       Regular expression matching shall be based on text lines. Since a
       <newline> separates or terminates patterns (see the −e and −f options
       below), regular expressions cannot contain a <newline>.  Similarly,
       since patterns are matched against individual lines (excluding the
       terminating <newline> characters) of the input, there is no way for a
       pattern to match a <newline> found in the input.
