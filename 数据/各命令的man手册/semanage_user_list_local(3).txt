       Behavior:
              The list function will return an array of all the objects in
              the selected location.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The function will allocate and
              populate the the array of objects, and store it at the
              location pointed by objects.  It will write the number of
              objects at the location pointed by count.  The array, and all
              its objects become property of the caller. Each object must be
              freed with semanage_OBJECT_free.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) )
