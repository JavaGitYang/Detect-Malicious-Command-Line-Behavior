       object file, executable file, or object-file library named by file.
       If no symbolic information is available for a valid input file, the
       nm utility shall report that fact, but not consider it an error
       condition.
       The default base used when numeric values are written is unspecified.
       On XSI-conformant systems, it shall be decimal.
