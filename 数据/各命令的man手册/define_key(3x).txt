       This is an extension to the curses library.  It permits an
       application to define keycodes with their corresponding control
       strings, so that the ncurses library will interpret them just as it
       would the predefined codes in the terminfo database.
       If the given string is null, any existing definition for the keycode
       is removed.  Similarly, if the given keycode is negative or zero, any
       existing string for the given definition is removed.
