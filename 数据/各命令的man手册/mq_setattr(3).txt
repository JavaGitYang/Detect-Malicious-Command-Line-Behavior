       mq_getattr() and mq_setattr() respectively retrieve and modify
       attributes of the message queue referred to by the message queue
       descriptor mqdes.
       mq_getattr() returns an mq_attr structure in the buffer pointed by
       attr.  This structure is defined as:
           struct mq_attr {
               long mq_flags;       /* Flags: 0 or O_NONBLOCK */
               long mq_maxmsg;      /* Max. # of messages on queue */
               long mq_msgsize;     /* Max. message size (bytes) */
               long mq_curmsgs;     /* # of messages currently in queue */
           };
       The mq_flags field contains flags associated with the open message
       queue description.  This field is initialized when the queue is cre‚Äê
       ated by mq_open(3).  The only flag that can appear in this field is
       O_NONBLOCK.
       The mq_maxmsg and mq_msgsize fields are set when the message queue is
       created by mq_open(3).  The mq_maxmsg field is an upper limit on the
       number of messages that may be placed on the queue using mq_send(3).
       The mq_msgsize field is an upper limit on the size of messages that
       may be placed on the queue.  Both of these fields must have a value
       greater than zero.  Two /proc files that place ceilings on the values
       for these fields are described in mq_overview(7).
       The mq_curmsgs field returns the number of messages currently held in
       the queue.
       mq_setattr() sets message queue attributes using information supplied
       in the mq_attr structure pointed to by newattr.  The only attribute
       that can be modified is the setting of the O_NONBLOCK flag in
       mq_flags.  The other fields in newattr are ignored.  If the oldattr
       field is not NULL, then the buffer that it points to is used to
       return an mq_attr structure that contains the same information that
       is returned by mq_getattr().
