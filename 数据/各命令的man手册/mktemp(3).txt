       Never use this function; see BUGS.
       The mktemp() function generates a unique temporary filename from
       template.  The last six characters of template must be XXXXXX and
       these are replaced with a string that makes the filename unique.
       Since it will be modified, template must not be a string constant,
       but should be declared as a character array.
