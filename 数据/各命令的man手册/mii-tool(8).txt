       This utility checks or sets the status of a network interface's Media
       Independent Interface (MII) unit.  Most fast ethernet adapters use an
       MII to autonegotiate link speed and duplex setting.
       Most intelligent network devices use an autonegotiation protocol to
       communicate what media technologies they support, and then select the
       fastest mutually supported media technology.  The -A or --advertise
       options can be used to tell the MII to only advertise a subset of its
       capabilities.  Some passive devices, such as single-speed hubs, are
       unable to autonegotiate.  To handle such devices, the MII protocol
       also allows for establishing a link by simply detecting either a
       10baseT or 100baseT link beat.  The -F or --force options can be used
       to force the MII to operate in one mode, instead of autonegotiating.
       The -A and -F options are mutually exclusive.
       The default short output reports the negotiated link speed and link
       status for each interface.
