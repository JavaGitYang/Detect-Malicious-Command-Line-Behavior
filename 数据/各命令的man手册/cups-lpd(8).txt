       cups-lpd is the CUPS Line Printer Daemon ("LPD") mini-server that
       supports legacy client systems that use the LPD protocol.  cups-lpd
       does not act as a standalone network daemon but instead operates
       using any of the Internet "super-servers" such as inetd(8),
       launchd(8), and systemd(8).
