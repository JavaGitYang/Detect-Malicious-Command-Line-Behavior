       sysinfo() returns certain statistics on memory and swap usage, as
       well as the load average.
       Until Linux 2.3.16, sysinfo() returned information in the following
       structure:
           struct sysinfo {
               long uptime;             /* Seconds since boot */
               unsigned long loads[3];  /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
               unsigned long totalram;  /* Total usable main memory size */
               unsigned long freeram;   /* Available memory size */
               unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
               unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
               unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
               unsigned long freeswap;  /* Swap space still available */
               unsigned short procs;    /* Number of current processes */
               char _f[22];             /* Pads structure to 64 bytes */
           };
       In the above structure, the sizes of the memory and swap fields are
       given in bytes.
       Since Linux 2.3.23 (i386) and Linux 2.3.48 (all architectures) the
       structure is:
           struct sysinfo {
               long uptime;             /* Seconds since boot */
               unsigned long loads[3];  /* 1, 5, and 15 minute load averages */
               unsigned long totalram;  /* Total usable main memory size */
               unsigned long freeram;   /* Available memory size */
               unsigned long sharedram; /* Amount of shared memory */
               unsigned long bufferram; /* Memory used by buffers */
               unsigned long totalswap; /* Total swap space size */
               unsigned long freeswap;  /* Swap space still available */
               unsigned short procs;    /* Number of current processes */
               unsigned long totalhigh; /* Total high memory size */
               unsigned long freehigh;  /* Available high memory size */
               unsigned int mem_unit;   /* Memory unit size in bytes */
               char _f[20-2*sizeof(long)-sizeof(int)];
                                        /* Padding to 64 bytes */
           };
       In the above structure, sizes of the memory and swap fields are given
       as multiples of mem_unit bytes.
