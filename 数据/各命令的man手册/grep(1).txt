       grep searches for PATTERN in each FILE.  A FILE of “-” stands for
       standard input.  If no FILE is given, recursive searches examine the
       working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.  By
       default, grep prints the matching lines.
       In addition, the variant programs egrep and fgrep are the same as
       grep -E and grep -F, respectively.  These variants are deprecated,
       but are provided for backward compatibility.
