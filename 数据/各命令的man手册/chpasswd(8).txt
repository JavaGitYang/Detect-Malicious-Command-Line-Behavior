       The chpasswd command reads a list of user name and password pairs
       from standard input and uses this information to update a group of
       existing users. Each line is of the format:
       user_name:password
       By default the passwords must be supplied in clear-text, and are
       encrypted by chpasswd. Also the password age will be updated, if
       present.
       By default, passwords are encrypted by PAM, but (even if not
       recommended) you can select a different encryption method with the
       -e, -m, or -c options.
       Except when PAM is used to encrypt the passwords, chpasswd first
       updates all the passwords in memory, and then commits all the changes
       to disk if no errors occurred for any user.
       When PAM is used to encrypt the passwords (and update the passwords
       in the system database) then if a password cannot be updated chpasswd
       continues updating the passwords of the next users, and will return
       an error code on exit.
       This command is intended to be used in a large system environment
       where many accounts are created at a single time.
