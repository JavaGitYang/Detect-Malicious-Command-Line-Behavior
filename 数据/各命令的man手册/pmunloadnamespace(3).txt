       If one has previously loaded a local Name Space using
       pmLoadNameSpace(3) or pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3), then calling
       pmUnloadNameSpace(3) will free up the memory associated with the Name
       Space and force all subsequent PMNS routine calls to use the
       distributed PMNS.  If pmUnloadNameSpace(3) is called before calling
       pmLoadNameSpace(3) or pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3), then it will
       effectively do nothing.
