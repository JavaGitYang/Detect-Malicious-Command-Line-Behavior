       Operating systems using the systemd(1) system and service manager are
       organized based on a file system hierarchy inspired by UNIX, more
       specifically the hierarchy described in the File System Hierarchy[1]
       specification and hier(7). This manual page describes a more minimal,
       modernized subset of these specifications that defines more strictly
       the suggestions and restrictions systemd makes on the file system
       hierarchy.
       Many of the paths described here can be queried with the
       systemd-path(1) tool.
