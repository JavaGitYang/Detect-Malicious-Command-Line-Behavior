       Create an initramfs <image> for the kernel with the version <kernel
       version>. If <kernel version> is omitted, then the version of the
       actual running kernel is used. If <image> is omitted or empty, then
       the default location /boot/initramfs-<kernel version>.img is used.
       dracut creates an initial image used by the kernel for preloading the
       block device modules (such as IDE, SCSI or RAID) which are needed to
       access the root filesystem, mounting the root filesystem and booting
       into the real system.
       At boot time, the kernel unpacks that archive into RAM disk, mounts
       and uses it as initial root file system. All finding of the root
       device happens in this early userspace.
       Initramfs images are also called "initrd".
       For a complete list of kernel command line options see
       dracut.cmdline(7).
       If you are dropped to an emergency shell, while booting your
       initramfs, the file /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt is created, which
       can be saved to a (to be mounted by hand) partition (usually /boot)
       or a USB stick. Additional debugging info can be produced by adding
       rd.debug to the kernel command line. /run/initramfs/rdsosreport.txt
       contains all logs and the output of some tools. It should be attached
       to any report about dracut problems.
