       Each manual page has a short description available within it.  whatis
       searches the manual page names and displays the manual page
       descriptions of any name matched.
       name may contain wildcards (-w) or be a regular expression (-r).
       Using these options, it may be necessary to quote the name or escape
       (\) the special characters to stop the shell from interpreting them.
       index databases are used during the search, and are updated by the
       mandb program.  Depending on your installation, this may be run by a
       periodic cron job, or may need to be run manually after new manual
       pages have been installed.  To produce an old style text whatis
       database from the relative index database, issue the command:
       whatis -M manpath -w '*' | sort > manpath/whatis
       where manpath is a manual page hierarchy such as /usr/man.
