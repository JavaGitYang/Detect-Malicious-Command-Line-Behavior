       This function will reinitialize the PKCS 11 subsystem in gnutls.
       This is required by PKCS 11 when an application uses fork(). The
       reinitialization function must be called on the child.
       Note that since GnuTLS 3.3.0, the reinitialization of the PKCS 11
       subsystem occurs automatically after fork.
