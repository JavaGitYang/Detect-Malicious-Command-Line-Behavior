       The lvm2-activation-generator is called by systemd(1) on boot to
       generate systemd units at runtime to activate LVM2 volumes if
       lvmetad(8) is disabled (global/use_lvmetad=0 lvm.conf(5) option is
       used). Otherwise, if lvmetad(8) is enabled, the
       lvm2-activation-generator exits immediately without generating any
       systemd units and LVM2 fully relies on event-based activation to
       activate the LVM2 volumes instead using the pvscan(8) (pvscan --cache
       -aay) call that is a part of udev(8) rules.
       These systemd units are generated by lvm2-activation-generator:
       lvm2-activation-early.service used for activation of LVM2 volumes
       that is ordered before systemd's special cryptsetup.target to support
       LVM2 volumes which are not layered on top of encrypted devices.
       lvm2-activation.service used for activation of LVM2 volumes that is
       ordered after systemd's special cryptsetup.target to support LVM2
       volumes which are layered on top of encrypted devices.
       lvm2-activation-net.service used for activation of LVM2 volumes that
       is ordered after systemd's special remote-fs-pre.target to support
       LVM2 volumes which are layered on attached remote devices.
       Note that all the underlying devices (Physical Volumes) need to be
       present when the service is run. If the there are any devices
       presented in the system anytime later, any LVM2 volumes on top of
       such devices need to be activated directly by lvchange(8) or
       vgchange(8). This limitation does not exist when using lvmetad(8) and
       accompanying event-based activation since such LVM volumes are
       activated automatically as soon as the Volume Group is ready (all the
       Physical Volumes making up the Volume Group are present in the
       system).
       The lvm2-activation-generator implements the Generators Specification
       as referenced in systemd(1).
