       ioperm() sets the port access permission bits for the calling thread
       for num bits starting from port address from.  If turn_on is nonzero,
       then permission for the specified bits is enabled; otherwise it is
       disabled.  If turn_on is nonzero, the calling thread must be
       privileged (CAP_SYS_RAWIO).
       Before Linux 2.6.8, only the first 0x3ff I/O ports could be specified
       in this manner.  For more ports, the iopl(2) system call had to be
       used (with a level argument of 3).  Since Linux 2.6.8, 65,536 I/O
       ports can be specified.
       Permissions are inherited by the child created by fork(2) (but see
       NOTES).  Permissions are preserved across execve(2); this is useful
       for giving port access permissions to unprivileged programs.
       This call is mostly for the i386 architecture.  On many other
       architectures it does not exist or will always return an error.
