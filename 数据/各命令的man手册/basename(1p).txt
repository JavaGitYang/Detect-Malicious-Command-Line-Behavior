       The string operand shall be treated as a pathname, as defined in the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.267, Pathname.
       The string string shall be converted to the filename corresponding to
       the last pathname component in string and then the suffix string
       suffix, if present, shall be removed. This shall be done by
       performing actions equivalent to the following steps in order:
        1. If string is a null string, it is unspecified whether the
           resulting string is '.'  or a null string. In either case, skip
           steps 2 through 6.
        2. If string is "//", it is implementation-defined whether steps 3
           to 6 are skipped or processed.
        3. If string consists entirely of <slash> characters, string shall
           be set to a single <slash> character. In this case, skip steps 4
           to 6.
        4. If there are any trailing <slash> characters in string, they
           shall be removed.
        5. If there are any <slash> characters remaining in string, the
           prefix of string up to and including the last <slash> character
           in string shall be removed.
        6. If the suffix operand is present, is not identical to the
           characters remaining in string, and is identical to a suffix of
           the characters remaining in string, the suffix suffix shall be
           removed from string.  Otherwise, string is not modified by this
           step. It shall not be considered an error if suffix is not found
           in string.
       The resulting string shall be written to standard output.
