       The function tcgetpgrp() returns the process group ID of the
       foreground process group on the terminal associated to fd, which must
       be the controlling terminal of the calling process.
       The function tcsetpgrp() makes the process group with process group
       ID pgrp the foreground process group on the terminal associated to
       fd, which must be the controlling terminal of the calling process,
       and still be associated with its session.  Moreover, pgrp must be a
       (nonempty) process group belonging to the same session as the calling
       process.
       If tcsetpgrp() is called by a member of a background process group in
       its session, and the calling process is not blocking or ignoring
       SIGTTOU, a SIGTTOU signal is sent to all members of this background
       process group.
