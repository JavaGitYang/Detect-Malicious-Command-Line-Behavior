       The open_memstream() and open_wmemstream() functions shall create an
       I/O stream associated with a dynamically allocated memory buffer. The
       stream shall be opened for writing and shall be seekable.
       The stream associated with a call to open_memstream() shall be byte-
       oriented.
       The stream associated with a call to open_wmemstream() shall be wide-
       oriented.
       The stream shall maintain a current position in the allocated buffer
       and a current buffer length. The position shall be initially set to
       zero (the start of the buffer). Each write to the stream shall start
       at the current position and move this position by the number of
       successfully written bytes for open_memstream() or the number of
       successfully written wide characters for open_wmemstream().  The
       length shall be initially set to zero. If a write moves the position
       to a value larger than the current length, the current length shall
       be set to this position. In this case a null character for
       open_memstream() or a null wide character for open_wmemstream() shall
       be appended to the current buffer. For both functions the terminating
       null is not included in the calculation of the buffer length.
       After a successful fflush() or fclose(), the pointer referenced by
       bufp shall contain the address of the buffer, and the variable
       pointed to by sizep shall contain the smaller of the current buffer
       length and the number of bytes for open_memstream(), or the number of
       wide characters for open_wmemstream(), between the beginning of the
       buffer and the current file position indicator.
       After a successful fflush() the pointer referenced by bufp and the
       variable referenced by sizep remain valid only until the next write
       operation on the stream or a call to fclose().
