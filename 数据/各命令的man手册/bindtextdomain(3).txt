       The bindtextdomain function sets the base directory of the hierarchy
       containing message catalogs for a given message domain.
       A message domain is a set of translatable msgid messages. Usually,
       every software package has its own message domain. The need for
       calling bindtextdomain arises because packages are not always
       installed with the same prefix as the <libintl.h> header and the
       libc/libintl libraries.
       Message catalogs will be expected at the pathnames
       dirname/locale/category/domainname.mo, where locale is a locale name
       and category is a locale facet such as LC_MESSAGES.
       domainname must be a non-empty string.
       If dirname is not NULL, the base directory for message catalogs
       belonging to domain domainname is set to dirname. The function makes
       copies of the argument strings as needed. If the program wishes to
       call the chdir function, it is important that dirname be an absolute
       pathname; otherwise it cannot be guaranteed that the message catalogs
       will be found.
       If dirname is NULL, the function returns the previously set base
       directory for domain domainname.
