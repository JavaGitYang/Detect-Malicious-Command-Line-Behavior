       This function will return the last alert number received.  This
       function should be called when GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED or
       GNUTLS_E_FATAL_ALERT_RECEIVED errors are returned by a gnutls
       function.  The peer may send alerts if he encounters an error.  If no
       alert has been received the returned value is undefined.
