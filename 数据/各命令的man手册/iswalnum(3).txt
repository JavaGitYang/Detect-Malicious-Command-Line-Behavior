       The iswalnum() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isalnum(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "alnum".
       The wide-character class "alnum" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "graph", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "print".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
       character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
       The wide-character class "alnum" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "punct".
       The wide-character class "alnum" is the union of the wide-character
       classes "alpha" and "digit".  As such, it also contains the wide-
       character class "xdigit".
       The wide-character class "alnum" always contains at least the letters
       'A' to 'Z', 'a' to 'z' and the digits '0' to '9'.
