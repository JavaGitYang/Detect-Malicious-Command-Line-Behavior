       pmdabash is an experimental Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports "xtrace" events from a traced bash(1) process.  This
       includes the command execution information that would usually be sent
       to standard error with the set -x option to the shell.
       Event metrics are exported showing each command executed, the
       function name and line number in the script, and a timestamp.
       Additionally, the process identifier for the shell and its parent
       process are exported.
       This requires bash version 4 or later.
       A brief description of the pmdabash command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named bash.log
            is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdabash is
            started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
       -s   Amount of time (in seconds) between subsequent evaluations of
            the shell trace file descriptor(s).  The default is 2 seconds.
       -m   Maximum amount of memory to be allowed for each event queue (one
            per traced process).  The default is 2 megabytes.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
