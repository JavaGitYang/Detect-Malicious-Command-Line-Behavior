       The read utility shall read a single line from standard input.
       By default, unless the −r option is specified, <backslash> shall act
       as an escape character. An unescaped <backslash> shall preserve the
       literal value of the following character, with the exception of a
       <newline>.  If a <newline> follows the <backslash>, the read utility
       shall interpret this as line continuation. The <backslash> and
       <newline> shall be removed before splitting the input into fields.
       All other unescaped <backslash> characters shall be removed after
       splitting the input into fields.
       If standard input is a terminal device and the invoking shell is
       interactive, read shall prompt for a continuation line when it reads
       an input line ending with a <backslash> <newline>, unless the −r
       option is specified.
       The terminating <newline> (if any) shall be removed from the input
       and the results shall be split into fields as in the shell for the
       results of parameter expansion (see Section 2.6.5, Field Splitting);
       the first field shall be assigned to the first variable var, the
       second field to the second variable var, and so on. If there are
       fewer fields than there are var operands, the remaining vars shall be
       set to empty strings. If there are fewer vars than fields, the last
       var shall be set to a value comprising the following elements:
        *  The field that corresponds to the last var in the normal
           assignment sequence described above
        *  The delimiter(s) that follow the field corresponding to the last
           var
        *  The remaining fields and their delimiters, with trailing IFS
           white space ignored
       The setting of variables specified by the var operands shall affect
       the current shell execution environment; see Section 2.12, Shell
       Execution Environment.  If it is called in a subshell or separate
       utility execution environment, such as one of the following:
           (read foo)
           nohup read ...
           find . −exec read ... \;
       it shall not affect the shell variables in the caller's environment.
