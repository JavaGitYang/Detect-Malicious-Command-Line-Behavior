       When run with the --cflags option, pcap-config writes to the standard
       output the -I compiler flags required to include libpcap's header
       files.  When run with the --libs option, pcap-config writes to the
       standard output the -L and -l linker flags required to link with
       libpcap, including -l flags for libraries required by libpcap.  When
       run with the --additional-libs option, pcap-config writes to the
       standard output the -L and -l flags for libraries required by
       libpcap, but not the -lpcap flag to link with libpcap itself.
       By default, it writes flags appropriate for compiling with a
       dynamically-linked version of libpcap; the --static flag causes it to
       write flags appropriate for compiling with a statically-linked
       version of libpcap.
