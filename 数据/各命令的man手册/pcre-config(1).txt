       pcre-config returns the configuration of the installed PCRE libraries
       and the options required to compile a program to use them. Some of
       the options apply only to the 8-bit, or 16-bit, or 32-bit libraries,
       respectively, and are not available if only one of those libraries
       has been built. If an unavailable option is encountered, the "usage"
       information is output.
