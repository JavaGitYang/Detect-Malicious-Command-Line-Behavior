       pcp-numastat displays NUMA allocation statistics from the kernel
       memory allocator.  Each process has NUMA policies that specify on
       which node pages are allocated.  The performance counters in the
       kernel track on which nodes memory is allocated and these values are
       sampled and reported by pcp-numastat.
       Counters are maintained individually for each NUMA node.  Details of
       the semantics of each reported metric can be retrieved using the
       following command:
            # pminfo ‚Äêdt mem.numa.alloc
       When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
       -O/--origin, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
       indirectly available.
       The current version of pcp-numastat can be queried using the
       -V/--version option.
