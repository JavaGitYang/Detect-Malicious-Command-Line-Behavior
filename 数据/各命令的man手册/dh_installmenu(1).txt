       dh_installmenu is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by the Debian menu package into package build
       directories.
       It also automatically generates the postinst and postrm commands
       needed to interface with the Debian menu package. These commands are
       inserted into the maintainer scripts by dh_installdeb(1).
