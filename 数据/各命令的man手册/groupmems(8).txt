       The groupmems command allows a user to administer his/her own group
       membership list without the requirement of superuser privileges. The
       groupmems utility is for systems that configure its users to be in
       their own name sake primary group (i.e., guest / guest).
       Only the superuser, as administrator, can use groupmems to alter the
       memberships of other groups.
