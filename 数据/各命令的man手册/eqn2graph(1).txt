       Reads an EQN equation (one line) as input; produces an image file (by
       default in Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as
       output.
       Your input EQN code should not have the .EQ/.EN preamble that
       normally precedes it within groff(1) macros; nor do you need to have
       dollar-sign or other delimiters around the equation.
       The output image will be clipped to the smallest possible bounding
       box that contains all the black pixels.  Older versions of convert(1)
       will produce a black-on-white graphic; newer ones may produce a
       black-on-transparent graphic.  By specifying command-line options to
       be passed to convert(1) you can give it a border, force the
       background transparent, set the image's pixel density, or perform
       other useful transformations.
       This program uses eqn(1), groff(1), and the ImageMagick convert(1)
       program.  These programs must be installed on your system and
       accessible on your $PATH for eqn2graph to work.
