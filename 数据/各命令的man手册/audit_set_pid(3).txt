       audit_set_pid tells the kernel what the pid is of the audit daemon.
       When the pid is set to 0, the kernel will log all events to syslog.
       Otherwise it will try to send events to the netlink connection that
       has the same pid given by this function. If for some reason the
       process goes away, the kernel will automatically set the value to 0
       itself. Usually this function is called by the audit daemon and not
       an external program.
