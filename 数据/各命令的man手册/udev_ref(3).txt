       udev_new() allocates a new udev context object and returns a pointer
       to it. This object is opaque and must not be accessed by the caller
       via different means than functions provided by libudev. Initially,
       the reference count of the context is 1. You can acquire further
       references, and drop gained references via udev_ref() and
       udev_unref(). Once the reference count hits 0, the context object is
       destroyed and freed.
