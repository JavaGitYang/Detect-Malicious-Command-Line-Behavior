       Remote helper programs are normally not used directly by end users,
       but they are invoked by Git when it needs to interact with remote
       repositories Git does not support natively. A given helper will
       implement a subset of the capabilities documented here. When Git
       needs to interact with a repository using a remote helper, it spawns
       the helper as an independent process, sends commands to the helper’s
       standard input, and expects results from the helper’s standard
       output. Because a remote helper runs as an independent process from
       Git, there is no need to re-link Git to add a new helper, nor any
       need to link the helper with the implementation of Git.
       Every helper must support the "capabilities" command, which Git uses
       to determine what other commands the helper will accept. Those other
       commands can be used to discover and update remote refs, transport
       objects between the object database and the remote repository, and
       update the local object store.
       Git comes with a "curl" family of remote helpers, that handle various
       transport protocols, such as git-remote-http, git-remote-https,
       git-remote-ftp and git-remote-ftps. They implement the capabilities
       fetch, option, and push.
