       These routines return a string of wchar_t wide characters in wstr,
       extracted starting at the current cursor position in the named
       window.
       The four functions with n as the last argument return a leading
       substring at most n characters long (exclusive of the trailing NUL).
       Transfer stops at the end of the current line, or when n characters
       have been stored at the location referenced by wstr.
       If the size n is not large enough to store a complete complex
       character, an error is generated.
