       The rsyslog.conf file is the main configuration file for the
       rsyslogd(8) which logs system messages on *nix systems.  This file
       specifies rules for logging.  For special features see the
       rsyslogd(8) manpage. Rsyslog.conf is backward-compatible with
       sysklogd's syslog.conf file. So if you migrate from sysklogd you can
       rename it and it should work.
       Note that this version of rsyslog ships with extensive documentation
       in html format.  This is provided in the ./doc subdirectory and
       probably in a separate package if you installed rsyslog via a
       packaging system.  To use rsyslog's advanced features, you need to
       look at the html documentation, because the man pages only cover
       basic aspects of operation.
