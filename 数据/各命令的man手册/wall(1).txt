       wall displays a message, or the contents of a file, or otherwise its
       standard input, on the terminals of all currently logged in users.
       The command will wrap lines that are longer than 79 characters.
       Short lines are whitespace padded to have 79 characters.  The command
       will always put a carriage return and new line at the end of each
       line.
       Only the superuser can write on the terminals of users who have
       chosen to deny messages or are using a program which automatically
       denies messages.
       Reading from a file is refused when the invoker is not superuser and
       the program is set-user-ID or set-group-ID.
