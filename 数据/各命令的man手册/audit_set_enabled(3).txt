       audit_set_enabled is used to control whether or not the audit system
       is active. When the audit system is enabled (enabled set to 1), every
       syscall will pass through the audit system to collect information and
       potentially trigger an event.
       If the audit system is disabled (enabled set to 0), syscalls do not
       enter the audit system and no data is collected. There may be some
       events generated by MAC subsystems like SE Linux even though the
       audit system is disabled. It is possible to suppress those events,
       too, by adding an audit rule with flags set to AUDIT_FILTER_TYPE.
