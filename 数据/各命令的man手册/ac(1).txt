       ac prints out a report of connect time (in hours) based on the
       logins/logouts in the current wtmp file.  A total is also printed
       out.
       The accounting file wtmp is maintained by init(8) and login(1).
       Neither ac nor login creates the wtmp if it doesn't exist, no
       accounting is done.  To begin accounting, create the file with a
       length of zero.
       NOTE:  The wtmp file can get really big, really fast.  You might want
       to trim it every once and a while.
       GNU ac works nearly the same UNIX ac, though it's a little smarter in
       several ways.  You should therefore expect differences in the output
       of GNU ac and the output of ac's on other systems.  Use the command
       info accounting to get additional information.
