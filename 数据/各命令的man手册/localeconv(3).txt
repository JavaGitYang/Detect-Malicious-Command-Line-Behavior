       The localeconv() function returns a pointer to a struct lconv for the
       current locale.  This structure is shown in locale(7), and contains
       all values associated with the locale categories LC_NUMERIC and
       LC_MONETARY.  Programs may also use the functions printf(3) and
       strfmon(3), which behave according to the actual locale in use.
