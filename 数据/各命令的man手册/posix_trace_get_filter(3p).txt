       The posix_trace_get_filter() function shall retrieve, into the
       argument pointed to by set, the actual trace event filter from the
       trace stream specified by trid.
       The posix_trace_set_filter() function shall change the set of
       filtered trace event types after a trace stream identified by the
       trid argument is created. This function may be called prior to
       starting the trace stream, or while the trace stream is active. By
       default, if no call is made to posix_trace_set_filter(), all trace
       events shall be recorded (that is, none of the trace event types are
       filtered out).
       If this function is called while the trace is in progress, a special
       system trace event, POSIX_TRACE_FILTER, shall be recorded in the
       trace indicating both the old and the new sets of filtered trace
       event types (see Table 2-4, Trace and Trace Event Filter Options:
       System Trace Events and Table 2-6, Trace, Trace Log, and Trace Event
       Filter Options: System Trace Events).
       If the posix_trace_set_filter() function is interrupted by a signal,
       an error shall be returned and the filter shall not be changed. In
       this case, the state of the trace stream shall not be changed.
       The value of the argument how indicates the manner in which the set
       is to be changed and shall have one of the following values, as
       defined in the <trace.h> header:
       POSIX_TRACE_SET_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall be
             the trace event type set pointed to by the argument set.
       POSIX_TRACE_ADD_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall be
             the union of the current set and the trace event type set
             pointed to by the argument set.
       POSIX_TRACE_SUB_EVENTSET
             The resulting set of trace event types to be filtered shall be
             all trace event types in the current set that are not in the
             set pointed to by the argument set; that is, remove each
             element of the specified set from the current filter.
