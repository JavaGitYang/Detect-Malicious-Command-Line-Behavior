       avc_entry_ref_init() initializes an avc_entry_ref structure; see
       ENTRY REFERENCES below.  This function may be implemented as a macro.
       avc_has_perm() checks whether the requested permissions are granted
       for subject SID ssid and target SID tsid, interpreting the
       permissions based on tclass and updating aeref, if non-NULL, to refer
       to a cache entry with the resulting decision.  The granting or denial
       of permissions is audited in accordance with the policy.  The
       auditdata parameter is for supplemental auditing; see avc_audit()
       below.
       avc_has_perm_noaudit() behaves as avc_has_perm() without producing an
       audit message.  The access decision is returned in avd and can be
       passed to avc_audit() explicitly.
       avc_audit() produces an audit message for the access query
       represented by ssid, tsid, tclass, and requested, with a decision
       represented by avd.  Pass the value returned by
       avc_has_perm_noaudit() as result.  The auditdata parameter is passed
       to the user-supplied func_audit callback and can be used to add
       supplemental information to the audit message; see avc_init(3).
