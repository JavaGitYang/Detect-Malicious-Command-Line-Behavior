       The file /etc/libaudit.conf contains configuration information for
       user space applications that link to libaudit. The applications are
       responsible for querrying the settings in this file and obeying the
       admin's preferences. This file contains one configuration keyword per
       line, an equal sign, and then followed by appropriate configuration
       information. The keywords recognized are: failure_action.  These
       keywords are described below.
       failure_action
              This keyword specifies what action the admin wishes a user
              space application to take when there is a failure to send an
              audit event to the kernel. The possible values are: IGNORE
               - meaning do nothing, LOG - write to syslog the inability to
              send an audit event, and TERMINATE - the user space
              application should exit.
