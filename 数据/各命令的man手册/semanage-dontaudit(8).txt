       semanage is used to configure certain elements of SELinux policy
       without requiring modification to or recompilation from policy
       sources.  semanage dontaudit toggles whether or not dontaudit rules
       will be in the policy.  Policy writers use dontaudit rules to cause
       confined applications to use alternative paths.  Dontaudit rules are
       denied but not reported in the logs.  Some times dontaudit rules can
       cause bugs in applications but policy writers will not realize it
       since the AVC is not audited.  Turning off dontaudit rules with this
       command to see if the kernel is blocking an access.
