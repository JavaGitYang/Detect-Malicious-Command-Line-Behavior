       Provides the internal ciphersuite index to be used with
       gnutls_cipher_suite_info(). The index  idx provided is an index kept
       at the priorities structure. It might be that a valid priorities
       index does not correspond to a ciphersuite and in that case
       GNUTLS_E_UNKNOWN_CIPHER_SUITE will be returned.  Once the last
       available index is crossed then GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE
       will be returned.
