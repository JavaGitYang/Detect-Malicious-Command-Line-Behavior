       keyctl_dh_compute() computes a Diffie-Hellman public key or shared
       secret.  That computation is:
              base ^ private ( mod prime )
       When base is a key containing the shared generator value, the remote
       public key is computed.  When base is a key containing the remote
       public key, the shared secret is computed.
       base, private, and prime must all refer to user-type keys containing
       the parameters for the computation.  Each of these keys must grant
       the caller read permission in order for them to be used.
       buffer and buflen specify the buffer into which the computed result
       will be placed.  buflen may be zero, in which case the buffer is not
       used and the minimum buffer length is fetched.
       keyctl_dh_compute_alloc() is similar to keyctl_dh_compute() except
       that it allocates a buffer big enough to hold the payload data and
       places the data in it.  If successful, a pointer to the buffer is
       placed in *_buffer.  The caller must free the buffer.
