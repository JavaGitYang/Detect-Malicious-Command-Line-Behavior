       xfs_bmap prints the map of disk blocks used by files in an XFS
       filesystem.  The map lists each extent used by the file, as well as
       regions in the file that do not have any corresponding blocks
       (holes).  Each line of the listings takes the following form:
              extent: [startoffset..endoffset]: startblock..endblock
       Holes are marked by replacing the startblock..endblock with hole.
       All the file offsets and disk blocks are in units of 512-byte blocks,
       no matter what the filesystem's block size is.
