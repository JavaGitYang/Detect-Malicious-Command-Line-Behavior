       For ctime(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The ctime() function shall convert the time pointed to by clock,
       representing time in seconds since the Epoch, to local time in the
       form of a string. It shall be equivalent to:
           asctime(localtime(clock))
       The asctime(), ctime(), gmtime(), and localtime() functions shall
       return values in one of two static objects: a broken-down time
       structure and an array of char.  Execution of any of the functions
       may overwrite the information returned in either of these objects by
       any of the other functions.
       The ctime() function need not be thread-safe.
       The ctime_r() function shall convert the calendar time pointed to by
       clock to local time in exactly the same form as ctime() and put the
       string into the array pointed to by buf (which shall be at least 26
       bytes in size) and return buf.
       Unlike ctime(), the ctime_r() function is not required to set tzname.
       If ctime_r() does not set tzname, it shall not set daylight and shall
       not set timezone.
