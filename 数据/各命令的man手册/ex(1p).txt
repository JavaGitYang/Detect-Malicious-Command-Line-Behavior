       The ex utility is a line-oriented text editor. There are two other
       modes of the editor—open and visual—in which screen-oriented editing
       is available. This is described more fully by the ex open and visual
       commands and in vi(1p).
       If an operand is '−', the results are unspecified.
       This section uses the term edit buffer to describe the current
       working text. No specific implementation is implied by this term. All
       editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes to
       it shall affect any file until an editor command writes the file.
       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
       support the complete ex definition, such as the full-screen editing
       commands (visual mode or open mode).  When these commands cannot be
       supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an
       error message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a syntax
       error. The implementation may either accept the commands and produce
       results on the screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt
       to meet the requirements of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 or report an
       error describing the terminal-related deficiency.
