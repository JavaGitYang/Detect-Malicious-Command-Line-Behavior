       pcap_create() is used to create a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.  source is a string that specifies the
       network device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a
       source argument of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from
       all interfaces.
       The returned handle must be activated with pcap_activate() before
       packets can be captured with it; options for the capture, such as
       promiscuous mode, can be set on the handle before activating it.
