       This function will check if the given certificate's subject matches
       the given hostname.  This is a basic implementation of the matching
       described in RFC6125, and takes into account wildcards, and the
       DNSName/IPAddress subject alternative name PKIX extension.
       For details see also gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname2().
