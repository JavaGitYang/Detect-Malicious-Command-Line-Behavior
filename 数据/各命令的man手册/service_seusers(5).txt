       These are optional files that allow services to define an SELinux
       user when authenticating via SELinux-aware login applications such as
       PAM(8).
       There is one file for each GNU/Linux user name that will be required
       to run a service with a specific SELinux user name.
       The path for each configuration file is formed by the path returned
       by selinux_policy_root(3) with /logins/username appended (where
       username is a file representing the GNU/Linux user name). The default
       services directory is located at:
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/logins
       Where {SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux configuration file
       config (see selinux_config(5)).
       getseuser(3) reads this file to map services to an SELinux user.
