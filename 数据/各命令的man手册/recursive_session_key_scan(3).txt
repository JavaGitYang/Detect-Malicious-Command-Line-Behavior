       recursive_key_scan() performs a depth-first recursive scan of the
       specified keyring tree and applies func to every link found in the
       accessible keyrings in that tree.  data is passed to each invocation
       of func.
       The return values of func are summed and returned as the overall
       return value.  Errors are ignored.  Inaccessible keyrings are not
       scanned, but links to them are still passed to func.
       recursive_session_key_scan() works exactly like recursive_key_scan()
       with the caller's session keyring specified as the starting keyring.
       The callback function is called for each link found in all the
       keyrings in the nominated tree and so may be called multiple times
       for a particular key if that key has multiple links to it.
       The callback function is passed the following parameters:
       parent The keyring containing the link or 0 for the initial key.
       key    The key to which the link points.
       desc and desc_len
              A pointer to the raw description and its length as retrieved
              with keyctl_describe_alloc().  These will be NULL and -1
              respectively if the description couldn't be retrieved and
              errno will retain the error from keyctl_describe_alloc().
       data   The data passed to the scanner function.
