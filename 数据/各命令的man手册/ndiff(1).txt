       Ndiff is a tool to aid in the comparison of Nmap scans. It takes two
       Nmap XML output files and prints the differences between them. The
       differences observed are:
       ·   Host states (e.g. up to down)
       ·   Port states (e.g. open to closed)
       ·   Service versions (from -sV)
       ·   OS matches (from -O)
       ·   Script output
       Ndiff, like the standard diff utility, compares two scans at a time.
