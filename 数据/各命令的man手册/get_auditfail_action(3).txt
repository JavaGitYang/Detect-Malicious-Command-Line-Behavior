       This function gets the failure_action tunable value stored in
       /etc/libaudit.conf. get_auditfail_action should be called after an
       audit_open call returns an error to see what action the admin
       prefers.
       The failure_action value found in /etc/libaudit.conf is copied into
       the failmode argument upon function return.  This value should then
       be used by the calling application to determine what action should be
       taken when the audit subsystem is unavailable.
