       keyctl_setperm() changes the permissions mask on a key.
       A process that does not have the SysAdmin capability may not change
       the permissions mask on a key that doesn't have the same UID as the
       caller.
       The caller must have setattr permission on a key to be able change
       its permissions mask.
       The permissions mask is a bitwise-OR of the following flags:
       KEY_xxx_VIEW
              Grant permission to view the attributes of a key.
       KEY_xxx_READ
              Grant permission to read the payload of a key or to list a
              keyring.
       KEY_xxx_WRITE
              Grant permission to modify the payload of a key or to add or
              remove links to/from a keyring.
       KEY_xxx_SEARCH
              Grant permission to find a key or to search a keyring.
       KEY_xxx_LINK
              Grant permission to make links to a key.
       KEY_xxx_SETATTR
              Grant permission to change the ownership and permissions
              attributes of a key.
       KEY_xxx_ALL
              Grant all the above.
       The 'xxx' in the above should be replaced by one of:
       POS    Grant the permission to a process that possesses the key (has
              it attached searchably to one of the process's keyrings).
       USR    Grant the permission to a process with the same UID as the
              key.
       GRP    Grant the permission to a process with the same GID as the
              key, or with a match for the key's GID amongst that process's
              Groups list.
       OTH    Grant the permission to any other process.
       Examples include: KEY_POS_VIEW, KEY_USR_READ, KEY_GRP_SEARCH and
       KEY_OTH_ALL.
       User, group and other grants are exclusive: if a process qualifies in
       the 'user' category, it will not qualify in the 'groups' category;
       and if a process qualifies in either 'user' or 'groups' then it will
       not qualify in the 'other' category.
       Possessor grants are cumulative with the grants from the 'user',
       'groups' and 'other' categories.
