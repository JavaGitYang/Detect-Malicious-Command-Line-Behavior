       This command displays the performance difference amongst two or more
       perf.data files captured via perf record.
       If no parameters are passed it will assume perf.data.old and
       perf.data.
       The differential profile is displayed only for events matching both
       specified perf.data files.
       If no parameters are passed the samples will be sorted by dso and
       symbol. As the perf.data files could come from different binaries,
       the symbols addresses could vary. So perf diff is based on the
       comparison of the files and symbols name.
