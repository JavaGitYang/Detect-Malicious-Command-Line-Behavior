       Provided the current Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) context is associated with a set of archive logs,
       pmLookupInDomArchive will scan the union of all the instance domain
       metadata for the instance domain indom, locate the first instance
       with the external identification given by name, and return the
       internal instance identifier.
       This routine is a specialized version of the more general PMAPI
       routine pmLookupInDom.
       Only the leading non-space characters of name will be used to
       identify the instance.
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       pmLookupInDomArchive will return a positive instance identifier on
       success.
