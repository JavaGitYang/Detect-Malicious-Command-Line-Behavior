       This function uses the mc5p or mc4 and mc5 capabilities, if they are
       present, to ship given data to a printer attached to the terminal.
       Note that the mcprint code has no way to do flow control with the
       printer or to know how much buffering it has.  Your application is
       responsible for keeping the rate of writes to the printer below its
       continuous throughput rate (typically about half of its nominal cps
       rating).  Dot-matrix printers and 6-page-per-minute lasers can
       typically handle 80cps, so a good conservative rule of thumb is to
       sleep for a second after shipping each 80-character line.
