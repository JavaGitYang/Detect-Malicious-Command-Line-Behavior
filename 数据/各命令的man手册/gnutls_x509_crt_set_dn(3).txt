       This function will set the DN on the provided certificate.  The input
       string should be plain ASCII or UTF-8 encoded. On DN parsing error
       GNUTLS_E_PARSING_ERROR is returned.
       Note that DNs are not expected to hold DNS information, and thus no
       automatic IDNA conversions are attempted when using this function.
       If that is required (e.g., store a domain in CN), process the
       corresponding input with gnutls_idna_map().
