       The function posix_fallocate() ensures that disk space is allocated
       for the file referred to by the file descriptor fd for the bytes in
       the range starting at offset and continuing for len bytes.  After a
       successful call to posix_fallocate(), subsequent writes to bytes in
       the specified range are guaranteed not to fail because of lack of
       disk space.
       If the size of the file is less than offset+len, then the file is
       increased to this size; otherwise the file size is left unchanged.
