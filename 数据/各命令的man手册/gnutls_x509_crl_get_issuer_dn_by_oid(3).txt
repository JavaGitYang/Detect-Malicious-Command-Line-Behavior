       This function will extract the part of the name of the CRL issuer
       specified by the given OID. The output will be encoded as described
       in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8 encoded,
       depending on the certificate data.
       Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h If
       raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as text.
       Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 -- in hex
       format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs using
       gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().
       If buf is null then only the size will be filled.
