       This program is designed to be run within maintainer scripts to
       achieve some tasks that dpkg can't (yet) handle natively either
       because of design decisions or due to current limitations.
       Many of those tasks require coordinated actions from several
       maintainer scripts (preinst, postinst, prerm, postrm). To avoid
       mistakes the same call simply needs to be put in all scripts and the
       program will automatically adapt its behaviour based on the
       environment variable DPKG_MAINTSCRIPT_NAME and on the maintainer
       scripts arguments that you have to forward after a double hyphen.
