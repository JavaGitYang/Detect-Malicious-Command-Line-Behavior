       The function call nan("n-char-sequence") shall be equivalent to:
           strtod("NAN(n-char-sequence)", (char **) NULL);
       The function call nan("") shall be equivalent to:
           strtod("NAN()", (char **) NULL)
       If tagp does not point to an n-char sequence or an empty string, the
       function call shall be equivalent to:
           strtod("NAN", (char **) NULL)
       Function calls to nanf() and nanl() are equivalent to the
       corresponding function calls to strtof() and strtold().
