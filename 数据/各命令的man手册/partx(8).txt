       Given a device or disk-image, partx tries to parse the partition
       table and list its contents.  It can also tell the kernel to add or
       remove partitions from its bookkeeping.
       The disk argument is optional when a partition argument is provided.
       To force scanning a partition as if it were a whole disk (for example
       to list nested subpartitions), use the argument "-" (hyphen-minus).
       For example:
              partx --show - /dev/sda3
       This will see sda3 as a whole-disk rather than as a partition.
       partx is not an fdisk program â€“ adding and removing partitions does
       not change the disk, it just tells the kernel about the presence and
       numbering of on-disk partitions.
