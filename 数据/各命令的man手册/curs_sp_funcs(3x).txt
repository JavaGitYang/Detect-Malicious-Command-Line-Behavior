       This implementation can be configured to provide a set of functions
       which improve the ability to manage multiple screens.  This feature
       can be added to any of the configurations supported by ncurses; it
       adds new entrypoints without changing the meaning of any of the
       existing ones.
   IMPROVED FUNCTIONS
       Most of the functions are new versions of existing functions.  A
       parameter is added at the front of the parameter list.  It is a
       SCREEN pointer.
       The existing functions all use the current screen, which is a static
       variable.  The extended functions use the specified screen, thereby
       reducing the number of variables which must be modified to update
       multiple screens.
   NEW FUNCTIONS
       Here are the new functions:
       ceiling_panel
            this returns a pointer to the topmost panel in the given screen.
       ground_panel
            this returns a pointer to the lowest panel in the given screen.
       new_prescr
            when creating a new screen, the library uses static variables
            which have been preset, e.g., by use_env(3X), filter(3X), etc.
            With the screen-pointer extension, there are situations where it
            must create a current screen before the unextended library does.
            The new_prescr function is used internally to handle these
            cases.  It is also provided as an entrypoint to allow
            applications to customize the library initialization.
