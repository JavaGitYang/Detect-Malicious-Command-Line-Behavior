       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fputwc() function shall write the character corresponding to the
       wide-character code wc to the output stream pointed to by stream, at
       the position indicated by the associated file-position indicator for
       the stream (if defined), and advances the indicator appropriately. If
       the file cannot support positioning requests, or if the stream was
       opened with append mode, the character is appended to the output
       stream. If an error occurs while writing the character, the shift
       state of the output file is left in an undefined state.
       The last data modification and last file status change timestamps of
       the file shall be marked for update between the successful execution
       of fputwc() and the next successful completion of a call to fflush()
       or fclose() on the same stream or a call to exit() or abort().
       The fputwc() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
