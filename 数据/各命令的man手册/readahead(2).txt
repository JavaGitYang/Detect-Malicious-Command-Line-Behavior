       readahead() initiates readahead on a file so that subsequent reads
       from that file will be satisfied from the cache, and not block on
       disk I/O (assuming the readahead was initiated early enough and that
       other activity on the system did not in the meantime flush pages from
       the cache).
       The fd argument is a file descriptor identifying the file which is to
       be read.  The offset argument specifies the starting point from which
       data is to be read and count specifies the number of bytes to be
       read.  I/O is performed in whole pages, so that offset is effectively
       rounded down to a page boundary and bytes are read up to the next
       page boundary greater than or equal to (offset+count).  readahead()
       does not read beyond the end of the file.  The file offset of the
       open file description referred to by fd is left unchanged.
