       getsockopt() and setsockopt() manipulate options for the socket
       referred to by the file descriptor sockfd.  Options may exist at
       multiple protocol levels; they are always present at the uppermost
       socket level.
       When manipulating socket options, the level at which the option
       resides and the name of the option must be specified.  To manipulate
       options at the sockets API level, level is specified as SOL_SOCKET.
       To manipulate options at any other level the protocol number of the
       appropriate protocol controlling the option is supplied.  For
       example, to indicate that an option is to be interpreted by the TCP
       protocol, level should be set to the protocol number of TCP; see
       getprotoent(3).
       The arguments optval and optlen are used to access option values for
       setsockopt().  For getsockopt() they identify a buffer in which the
       value for the requested option(s) are to be returned.  For
       getsockopt(), optlen is a value-result argument, initially containing
       the size of the buffer pointed to by optval, and modified on return
       to indicate the actual size of the value returned.  If no option
       value is to be supplied or returned, optval may be NULL.
       Optname and any specified options are passed uninterpreted to the
       appropriate protocol module for interpretation.  The include file
       <sys/socket.h> contains definitions for socket level options,
       described below.  Options at other protocol levels vary in format and
       name; consult the appropriate entries in section 4 of the manual.
       Most socket-level options utilize an int argument for optval.  For
       setsockopt(), the argument should be nonzero to enable a boolean
       option, or zero if the option is to be disabled.
       For a description of the available socket options see socket(7) and
       the appropriate protocol man pages.
