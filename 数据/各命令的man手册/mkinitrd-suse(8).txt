       mkinitrd creates an initramfs image <initrd-image> for the kernel
       with version <kernel-version> by calling dracut.
           Important
           This version of mkinitrd is provided for compability with older
           versions of mkinitrd. If a more fine grained control over the
           resulting image is needed, dracut should be called directly.
