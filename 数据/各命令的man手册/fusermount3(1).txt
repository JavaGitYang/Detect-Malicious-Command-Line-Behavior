       Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a simple interface for userspace
       programs to export a virtual filesystem to the Linux kernel. It also
       aims to provide a secure method for non privileged users to create
       and mount their own filesystem implementations.
       fusermount3 is a program to mount and unmount FUSE filesystems. It
       should be called directly only for unmounting FUSE file systems. To
       allow mounting and unmounting by unprivileged users, fusermount3
       needs to be installed set-uid root.
