       sd_event_source_set_userdata() may be used to set an arbitrary user
       data pointer for the event source object specified as source. The
       user data pointer is usually specified when creating an event source
       object with calls such as sd_event_add_io(3) or sd_event_add_time(3),
       and may be updated with this call. The user data pointer is also
       passed to all handler callback functions associated with the event
       source. The userdata parameter specifies the new user data pointer to
       set, the function returns the previous user data pointer. Note that
       NULL is a valid user data pointer.
       sd_event_source_get_userdata() may be used to query the current user
       data pointer assigned to the event source object source.
