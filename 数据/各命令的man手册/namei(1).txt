       namei interprets its arguments as pathnames to any type of Unix file
       (symlinks, files, directories, and so forth).  namei then follows
       each pathname until an endpoint is found (a file, a directory, a
       device node, etc).  If it finds a symbolic link, it shows the link,
       and starts following it, indenting the output to show the context.
       This program is useful for finding "too many levels of symbolic
       links" problems.
       For each line of output, namei uses the following characters to
       identify the file type found:
          f: = the pathname currently being resolved
           d = directory
           l = symbolic link (both the link and its contents are output)
           s = socket
           b = block device
           c = character device
           p = FIFO (named pipe)
           - = regular file
           ? = an error of some kind
       namei prints an informative message when the maximum number of
       symbolic links this system can have has been exceeded.
