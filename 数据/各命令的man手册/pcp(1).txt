       The pcp command is used in one of two modes.  By default, it
       summarizes the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) installation on the local
       host.  This mode can also be used to summarize the installation from
       a remote host, or a historical installation from a set of PCP
       archives.  This mode indirectly invokes the pcp-summary command (in
       the absence of any other requested command).
       Alternatively, a command can be passed to pcp to run, again possibly
       in the context of a remote host or set of historical archives.
