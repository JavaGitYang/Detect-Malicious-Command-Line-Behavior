       The NFSv4 protocol represents the local system's UID and GID values
       on the wire as strings of the form user@domain.  The process of
       translating from UID to string and string to UID is referred to as
       "ID mapping."
       The system derives the user part of the string by performing a
       password or group lookup.  The lookup mechanism is configured in
       /etc/idmapd.conf.
       By default, the domain part of the string is the system's DNS domain
       name.  It can also be specified in /etc/idmapd.conf if the system is
       multi-homed, or if the system's DNS domain name does not match the
       name of the system's Kerberos realm.
       When the domain is not specified in /etc/idmapd.conf the local DNS
       server will be queried for the _nfsv4idmapdomain text record. If the
       record exists that will be used as the domain. When the record does
       not exist, the domain part of the DNS domain will used.
       The /usr/sbin/nfsidmap program performs translations on behalf of the
       kernel.  The kernel uses the request-key mechanism to perform an
       upcall.  /usr/sbin/nfsidmap is invoked by /sbin/request-key, performs
       the translation, and initializes a key with the resulting
       information.  The kernel then caches the translation results in the
       key.
       nfsidmap can also clear cached ID map results in the kernel, or
       revoke one particular key.  An incorrect cached key can result in
       file and directory ownership reverting to "nobody" on NFSv4 mount
       points.
       In addition, the -d and -l options are available to help diagnose
       misconfigurations.  They have no effect on the keyring containing ID
       mapping results.
