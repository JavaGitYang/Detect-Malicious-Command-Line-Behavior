       The tzset() function shall use the value of the environment variable
       TZ to set time conversion information used by ctime(3p),
       localtime(3p), mktime(3p), and strftime(3p).  If TZ is absent from
       the environment, implementation-defined default timezone information
       shall be used.
       The tzset() function shall set the external variable tzname as
       follows:
           tzname[0] = "std";
           tzname[1] = "dst";
       where std and dst are as described in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Chapter 8, Environment Variables.
       The tzset() function also shall set the external variable daylight to
       0 if Daylight Savings Time conversions should never be applied for
       the timezone in use; otherwise, non-zero. The external variable
       timezone shall be set to the difference, in seconds, between
       Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and local standard time.
