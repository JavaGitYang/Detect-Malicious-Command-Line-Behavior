       fgetc() reads the next character from stream and returns it as an
       unsigned char cast to an int, or EOF on end of file or error.
       getc() is equivalent to fgetc() except that it may be implemented as
       a macro which evaluates stream more than once.
       getchar() is equivalent to getc(stdin).
       fgets() reads in at most one less than size characters from stream
       and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s.  Reading stops after
       an EOF or a newline.  If a newline is read, it is stored into the
       buffer.  A terminating null byte ('\0') is stored after the last
       character in the buffer.
       ungetc() pushes c back to stream, cast to unsigned char, where it is
       available for subsequent read operations.  Pushed-back characters
       will be returned in reverse order; only one pushback is guaranteed.
       Calls to the functions described here can be mixed with each other
       and with calls to other input functions from the stdio library for
       the same input stream.
