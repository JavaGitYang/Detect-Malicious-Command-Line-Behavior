       The seccomp_merge() function merges the seccomp filter in src with
       the filter in dst and stores the resulting in the dst filter.  If
       successful, the src seccomp filter is released and all internal
       memory associated with the filter is freed; there is no need to call
       seccomp_release(3) on src and the caller should discard any
       references to the filter.
       In order to merge two seccomp filters, both filters must have the
       same attribute values and no overlapping architectures.
