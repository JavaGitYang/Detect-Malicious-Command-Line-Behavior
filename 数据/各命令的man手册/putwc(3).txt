       The fputwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       fputc(3) function.  It writes the wide character wc to stream.  If
       ferror(stream) becomes true, it returns WEOF.  If a wide-character
       conversion error occurs, it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.
       Otherwise, it returns wc.
       The putwc() function or macro functions identically to fputwc().  It
       may be implemented as a macro, and may evaluate its argument more
       than once.  There is no reason ever to use it.
