       The pcp-atopsar program can be used to report statistics at the
       system level.
       In the first synopsis line (no sampling interval specified), pcp-
       atopsar extracts data from a raw logfile that has been recorded
       previously by pmlogger(1) (or via the -w option of the pcp-atop
       program).
       You can specify the name of the logfile with the -r option of the
       pcp-atopsar program.  When a pmlogger daily logfile is used, named
       $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/[host]/YYYYMMDD (where YYYYMMDD reflects the
       date), the required date of the form YYYYMMDD can be specified with
       the -r option instead of the filename, or the symbolic name 'y' can
       be used for yesterday's daily logfile (this can be repeated so 'yyyy'
       indicates the logfile of four days ago).  If the -r option is not
       specified at all, today's daily logfile is used by default.
       By default, the hostname of the localhost will be used when resolving
       pmlogger archives, however an alternative host can be specified using
       the -h option.
       The starting and ending times of the report can be defined using the
       options -b and -e followed by a time argument of the form hh:mm.
       In the second synopsis line, pcp-atopsar reads actual activity
       counters from the kernel with the specified interval (in seconds) and
       the specified number of samples (optionally).  When pcp-atopsar is
       activated in this way it immediately sends the output for every
       requested report to standard output.  If only one type of report is
       requested, the header is printed once and after every interval
       seconds the statistical counters are shown for that period.  If
       several reports are requested, a header is printed per sample
       followed by the statistical counters for that period.
       When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the PCPIntro(1) options
       -h/--host, -a/--archive, -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval,
       -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become indirectly
       available.
       Some generic flags can be specified to influence the behaviour of the
       pcp-atopsar program:
       -S   By default the timestamp at the beginning of a line is
            suppressed if more lines are shown for one interval. With this
            flag a timestamp is given for every output-line (easier for
            post-processing).
       -a   By default certain resources as disks and network interfaces are
            only shown when they were active during the interval.  With this
            flag all resources of a given type are shown, even if they were
            inactive during the interval.
       -x   By default pcp-atopsar only uses colors if output is directed to
            a terminal (window).  These colors might indicate that a
            critical occupation percentage has been reached (red) or has
            been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.  See the
            man-page of atop for a detailed description of this feature
            (section COLORS).
            With the flag -x the use of colors is suppressed
            unconditionally.
       -C   By default pcp-atopsar only uses colors if output is directed to
            a terminal (window).  These colors might indicate that a
            critical occupation percentage has been reached (red) or has
            been almost reached (cyan) for a particular resource.  See the
            man-page of atop for a detailed description of this feature
            (section COLORS).
            With the flag -C colors will always be used, even if output is
            not directed to a terminal.
       -M   Use markers at the end of a line to indicate that a critical
            occupation percentage has been reached ('*') or has been almost
            reached ('+') for particular resources. The marker '*' is
            similar to the color red and the marker '+' to the color cyan.
            See the man-page of atop for a detailed description of these
            colors (section COLORS).
       -H   Repeat the header line within a report for every N detail lines.
            The value of N is determined dynamically in case of output to a
            tty/window (depending on the number of lines); for output to a
            file or pipe this value is 23.
       -R   Summarize cnt samples into one sample. When the logfile contains
            e.g. samples of 10 minutes, the use of the flag '-R 6' shows a
            report with one sample for every hour.
       Other flags are used to define which reports are required:
       -A   Show all possible reports.
       -c   Report about CPU utilization (in total and per cpu).
       -p   Report about processor-related matters, like load-averages and
            hardware interrupts.
       -P   Report about processes.
       -m   Current memory- and swap-occupation.
       -s   Report about paging- and swapping-activity, and overcommitment.
       -l   Report about utilization of logical volumes.
       -f   Report about utilization of multiple devices.
       -d   Report about utilization of disks.
       -n   Report about NFS mounted filesystems on NFS client.
       -j   Report about NFS client activity.
       -J   Report about NFS server activity.
       -i   Report about the network interfaces.
       -I   Report about errors for network-interfaces.
       -w   Report about IP version 4 network traffic.
       -W   Report about errors for IP version 4 traffic.
       -y   General report about ICMP version 4 layer activity.
       -Y   Per-type report about ICMP version 4 layer activity.
       -u   Report about UDP version 4 network traffic.
       -z   Report about IP version 6 network traffic.
       -Z   Report about errors for IP version 6 traffic.
       -k   General report about ICMP version 6 layer activity.
       -K   Per-type report about ICMP version 6 layer activity.
       -U   Report about UDP version 6 network traffic.
       -t   Report about TCP network traffic.
       -T   Report about errors for TCP-traffic.
       -O   Report about top-3 processes consuming most processor capacity.
            This report is only available when using a log file (not when
            specifying an interval).
       -G   Report about top-3 processes consuming most resident memory.
            This report is only available when using a log file (not when
            specifying an interval).
       -D   Report about top-3 processes issueing most disk transfers.  This
            report is only available when using a log file (not when
            specifying an interval).
       -N   Report about top-3 processes issueing most IPv4/IPv6 socket
            transfers.  This report is only available when using a log file
            (not when specifying an interval).
