       The lttng rotate command archives the current trace chunk of the
       current tracing session, or of the tracing session named SESSION if
       provided, to the file system. This action is called a tracing session
       rotation.
       Once a trace chunk is archived, LTTng does not manage it anymore: you
       can read it, modify it, move it, or remove it.
       An archived trace chunk is a collection of metadata and data stream
       files which form a self-contained trace.
       The current trace chunk of a given tracing session includes:
       ·   The stream files already written to the file system, and which
           are not part of a previously archived trace chunk, since the most
           recent event amongst:
           ·   The first time the tracing session was started with
               lttng-start(1).
           ·   The last rotation, either a manual one with lttng rotate, or
               an automatic one from a rotation schedule previously set with
               lttng-enable-rotation(1).
       ·   The content of all the non-flushed sub-buffers of the tracing
           session’s channels.
       You can use lttng rotate either at any time when the tracing session
       is active (see lttng-start(1)), or a single time once the tracing
       session becomes inactive (see lttng-stop(1)).
       By default, the lttng rotate command ensures that the rotation is
       done before printing the archived trace chunk’s path and returning to
       the prompt. The printed path is absolute when the tracing session was
       created in normal mode and relative to the relay daemon’s output
       directory (see the --output option in lttng-relayd(8)) when it was
       created in network streaming mode (see lttng-create(1)).
       With the --no-wait option, the command finishes immediately, hence a
       rotation might not be completed when the command is done. In this
       case, there is no easy way to know when the current trace chunk is
       archived, and the command does not print the archived trace chunk’s
       path.
       Because a rotation causes the tracing session’s current sub-buffers
       to be flushed, archived trace chunks are never redundant, that is,
       they do not overlap over time like snapshots can (see
       lttng-snapshot(1)). Also, a rotation does not directly cause
       discarded event records or packets.
       See LIMITATIONS for important limitations regarding this command.
   Trace chunk archive naming
       A trace chunk archive is a subdirectory of a tracing session’s output
       directory (see the --output option in lttng-create(1)) which
       contains, through tracing domain and possibly UID/PID subdirectories,
       metadata and data stream files.
       A trace chunk archive is, at the same time:
       ·   A self-contained LTTng trace.
       ·   A member of a set of trace chunk archives which form the complete
           trace of a tracing session.
       In other words, an LTTng trace reader can read both the tracing
       session output directory (all the trace chunk archives), or a single
       trace chunk archive.
       When a tracing session rotation occurs, the created trace chunk
       archive is named:
           BEGIN-END-ID
       BEGIN
           Date and time of the beginning of the trace chunk archive with
           the ISO 8601-compatible YYYYmmddTHHMMSS±HHMM form, where YYYYmmdd
           is the date and HHMMSS±HHMM is the time with the time zone offset
           from UTC.
           Example: 20171119T152407-0500
       END
           Date and time of the end of the trace chunk archive with the ISO
           8601-compatible YYYYmmddTHHMMSS±HHMM form, where YYYYmmdd is the
           date and HHMMSS±HHMM is the time with the time zone offset from
           UTC.
           Example: 20180118T152407+0930
       ID
           Unique numeric identifier of the trace chunk within its tracing
           session.

       20171119T152407-0500-20171119T151422-0500-3
