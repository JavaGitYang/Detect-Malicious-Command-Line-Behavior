     The acl_copy_ext() function copies the ACL pointed to by acl from sys‐
     tem-managed space to the user managed space pointed to by buf_p.  The
     size parameter represents the size in bytes of the buffer pointed to by
     buf_p.  The format of the ACL placed in the buffer pointed to by buf_p
     is a contiguous, persistent data item, the format of which is unspeci‐
     fied.  It is the responsibility of the invoker to allocate an area
     large enough to hold the copied ACL. The size of the exportable, con‐
     tiguous, persistent form of the ACL may be obtained by invoking the
     acl_size() function.
     Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to an entry in the ACL referenced
     by acl continue to refer to those entries. Any existing ACL pointers
     that refer to the ACL referenced by acl continue to refer to the ACL.
