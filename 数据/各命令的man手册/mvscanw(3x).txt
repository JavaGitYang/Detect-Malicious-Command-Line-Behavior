       The scanw, wscanw and mvscanw routines are analogous to scanf [see
       scanf(3)].  The effect of these routines is as though wgetstr were
       called on the window, and the resulting line used as input for
       sscanf(3).  Fields which do not map to a variable in the fmt field
       are lost.
       The vwscanw and vw_scanw routines are analogous to vscanf(3).  They
       perform a wscanw using a variable argument list.  The third argument
       is a va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments, as defined in
       <stdarg.h>.
