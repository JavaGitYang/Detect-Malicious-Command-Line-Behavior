       The getnetent() function reads the next entry from the networks
       database and returns a netent structure containing the broken-out
       fields from the entry.  A connection is opened to the database if
       necessary.
       The getnetbyname() function returns a netent structure for the entry
       from the database that matches the network name.
       The getnetbyaddr() function returns a netent structure for the entry
       from the database that matches the network number net of type type.
       The net argument must be in host byte order.
       The setnetent() function opens a connection to the database, and sets
       the next entry to the first entry.  If stayopen is nonzero, then the
       connection to the database will not be closed between calls to one of
       the getnet*() functions.
       The endnetent() function closes the connection to the database.
       The netent structure is defined in <netdb.h> as follows:
           struct netent {
               char      *n_name;     /* official network name */
               char     **n_aliases;  /* alias list */
               int        n_addrtype; /* net address type */
               uint32_t   n_net;      /* network number */
           }
       The members of the netent structure are:
       n_name The official name of the network.
       n_aliases
              A NULL-terminated list of alternative names for the network.
       n_addrtype
              The type of the network number; always AF_INET.
       n_net  The network number in host byte order.
