       The CBS (Credit Based Shaper) qdisc implements the shaping algorithm
       defined by the IEEE 802.1Q-2014 Section 8.6.8.2, which applies a well
       defined rate limiting method to the traffic.
       This queueing discipline is intended to be used by TSN (Time
       Sensitive Networking) applications, the CBS parameters are derived
       directly by what is described by the Annex L of the IEEE 802.1Q-2014
       Sepcification. The algorithm and how it affects the latency are
       detailed there.
       CBS is meant to be installed under another qdisc that maps packet
       flows to traffic classes, one example is mqprio(8).
