       This utility shall be provided on systems that both support the User
       Portability Utilities option and define the POSIX2_CHAR_TERM symbol.
       On other systems it is optional.
       The vi (visual) utility is a screen-oriented text editor. Only the
       open and visual modes of the editor are described in POSIX.1‐2008;
       see the line editor ex for additional editing capabilities used in
       vi.  The user can switch back and forth between vi and ex and execute
       ex commands from within vi.
       This reference page uses the term edit buffer to describe the current
       working text. No specific implementation is implied by this term. All
       editing changes are performed on the edit buffer, and no changes to
       it shall affect any file until an editor command writes the file.
       When using vi, the terminal screen acts as a window into the editing
       buffer. Changes made to the editing buffer shall be reflected in the
       screen display; the position of the cursor on the screen shall
       indicate the position within the editing buffer.
       Certain terminals do not have all the capabilities necessary to
       support the complete vi definition. When these commands cannot be
       supported on such terminals, this condition shall not produce an
       error message such as ``not an editor command'' or report a syntax
       error. The implementation may either accept the commands and produce
       results on the screen that are the result of an unsuccessful attempt
       to meet the requirements of this volume of POSIX.1‐2008 or report an
       error describing the terminal-related deficiency.
