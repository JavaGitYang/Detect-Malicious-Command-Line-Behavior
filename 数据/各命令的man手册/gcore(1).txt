       Generate a core dump of a running program with process ID pid.
       Produced file is equivalent to a kernel produced core file as if the
       process crashed (and if "ulimit -c" were used to set up an
       appropriate core dump limit).  Unlike after a crash, after gcore the
       program remains running without any change.
