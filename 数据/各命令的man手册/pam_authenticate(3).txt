       The pam_authenticate function is used to authenticate the user. The
       user is required to provide an authentication token depending upon
       the authentication service, usually this is a password, but could
       also be a finger print.
       The PAM service module may request that the user enter their username
       via the conversation mechanism (see pam_start(3) and pam_conv(3)).
       The name of the authenticated user will be present in the PAM item
       PAM_USER. This item may be recovered with a call to pam_get_item(3).
       The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
       more of the following values:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           The PAM module service should return PAM_AUTH_ERR if the user
           does not have a registered authentication token.
