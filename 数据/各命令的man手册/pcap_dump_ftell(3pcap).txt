       pcap_dump_ftell() returns the current file position for the
       ``savefile'', representing the number of bytes written by
       pcap_dump_open() and pcap_dump().  -1 is returned on error.  If the
       current file position does not fit in a long, it will be truncated;
       this can happen on 32-bit UNIX-like systems with large file support
       and on Windows.  pcap_dump_ftell64() returns the current file
       position in a int64_t, so if file offsets that don't fit in a long
       but that fit in a int64_t are supported, this will return the file
       offset without truncation.  -1 is returned on error.
