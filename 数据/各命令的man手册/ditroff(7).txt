       The name ditroff once marked a development level of the troff text
       processing system.  In actual roff(7) systems, the name troff is used
       as a synonym for ditroff.
       The first roff system was written by Joe Ossanna around 1973.  It
       supported only two output devices, the nroff program produced text
       oriented tty output, while the troff program generated graphical
       output for exactly one output device, the Wang Graphic Systems CAT
       typesetter.
       In 1979, Brian Kernighan rewrote troff to support more devices by
       creating an intermediate output format for troff that can be fed into
       postprocessor programs which actually do the printout on the device.
       Kernighan's version marks what is known as classical troff today.  In
       order to distinguish it from Ossanna's original mono-device version,
       it was called ditroff (device independent troff) on some systems,
       though this naming isn't mentioned in the classical documentation.
       Today, any existing roff system is based on Kernighan's multi-device
       troff.  The distinction between troff and ditroff isn't necessary any
       longer, for each modern troff provides already the complete
       functionality of ditroff.  On most systems, the name troff is used to
       denote ditroff.
       The easiest way to use ditroff is the GNU roff system, groff.  The
       groff(1) program is a wrapper around (di)troff that automatically
       handles postprocessing.
