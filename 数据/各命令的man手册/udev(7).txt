       udev supplies the system software with device events, manages
       permissions of device nodes and may create additional symlinks in the
       /dev directory, or renames network interfaces. The kernel usually
       just assigns unpredictable device names based on the order of
       discovery. Meaningful symlinks or network device names provide a way
       to reliably identify devices based on their properties or current
       configuration.
       The udev daemon, systemd-udevd.service(8), receives device uevents
       directly from the kernel whenever a device is added or removed from
       the system, or it changes its state. When udev receives a device
       event, it matches its configured set of rules against various device
       attributes to identify the device. Rules that match may provide
       additional device information to be stored in the udev database or to
       be used to create meaningful symlink names.
       All device information udev processes is stored in the udev database
       and sent out to possible event subscribers. Access to all stored data
       and the event sources is provided by the library libudev.
