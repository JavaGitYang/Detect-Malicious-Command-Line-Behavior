       This function studies a compiled pattern, to see if additional
       information can be extracted that might speed up matching. Its
       arguments are:
         code       A compiled regular expression
         options    Options for pcre[16|32]_study()
         errptr     Where to put an error message
       If the function succeeds, it returns a value that can be passed to
       pcre[16|32]_exec() or pcre[16|32]_dfa_exec() via their extra
       arguments.
       If the function returns NULL, either it could not find any additional
       information, or there was an error. You can tell the difference by
       looking at the error value. It is NULL in first case.
       The only option is PCRE_STUDY_JIT_COMPILE. It requests just-in-time
       compilation if possible. If PCRE has been compiled without JIT
       support, this option is ignored. See the pcrejit page for further
       details.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
