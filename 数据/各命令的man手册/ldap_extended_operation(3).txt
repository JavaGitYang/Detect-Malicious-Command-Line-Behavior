       The ldap_extended_operation_s() routine is used to synchronously
       perform an LDAP extended operation.  It takes requestoid, which
       points to a dotted-decimal OID string identifying the extended
       operation to perform. requestdata is the data required for the
       request, sctrls is an array of LDAPControl structures to use with
       this extended operation, cctrls is an array of LDAPControl structures
       that list the client controls to use with this extended operation.
       The output parameter retoidp points to a dotted-decimal OID string
       returned by the LDAP server.  The memory used by the string should be
       freed with the ldap_memfree(3) function.  The output parameter
       retdatap points to a pointer to a berval structure that contains the
       returned data.  If no data is returned by the server, the pointer is
       set this to NULL.  The memory used by this structure should be freed
       with the ber_bvfree(3) function.
       The ldap_extended_operation() works just like
       ldap_extended_operation_s(), but the operation is asynchronous.  It
       provides the message id of the request it initiated in the integer
       pointed to be msgidp.  The result of this operation can be obtained
       by calling ldap_result(3).
