       This function will verify the provided data against the signature
       present in the SignedData of the PKCS 7 structure. If the data
       provided are NULL then the data in the encapsulatedContent field will
       be used instead.
       Note that, unlike gnutls_pkcs7_verify() this function does not verify
       the key purpose of the signer. It is expected for the caller to
       verify the intended purpose of the signer -e.g., via
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_key_purpose_oid(), or
       gnutls_x509_crt_check_key_purpose().
       Note also, that since GnuTLS 3.5.6 this function introduces checks in
       the end certificate ( signer ), including time checks and key usage
       checks.
