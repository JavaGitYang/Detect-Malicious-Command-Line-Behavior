       This function returns the current time as seconds and milliseconds
       since the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).  The time is
       returned in tp, which is declared as follows:
           struct timeb {
               time_t         time;
               unsigned short millitm;
               short          timezone;
               short          dstflag;
           };
       Here time is the number of seconds since the Epoch, and millitm is
       the number of milliseconds since time seconds since the Epoch.  The
       timezone field is the local timezone measured in minutes of time west
       of Greenwich (with a negative value indicating minutes east of Green‚Äê
       wich).  The dstflag field is a flag that, if nonzero, indicates that
       Daylight Saving time applies locally during the appropriate part of
       the year.
       POSIX.1-2001 says that the contents of the timezone and dstflag
       fields are unspecified; avoid relying on them.
