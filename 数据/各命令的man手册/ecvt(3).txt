       The ecvt() function converts number to a null-terminated string of
       ndigits digits (where ndigits is reduced to a system-specific limit
       determined by the precision of a double), and returns a pointer to
       the string.  The high-order digit is nonzero, unless number is zero.
       The low order digit is rounded.  The string itself does not contain a
       decimal point; however, the position of the decimal point relative to
       the start of the string is stored in *decpt.  A negative value for
       *decpt means that the decimal point is to the left of the start of
       the string.  If the sign of number is negative, *sign is set to a
       nonzero value, otherwise it is set to 0.  If number is zero, it is
       unspecified whether *decpt is 0 or 1.
       The fcvt() function is identical to ecvt(), except that ndigits
       specifies the number of digits after the decimal point.
