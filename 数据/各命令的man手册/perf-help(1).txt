       With no options and no COMMAND given, the synopsis of the perf
       command and a list of the most commonly used perf commands are
       printed on the standard output.
       If the option --all or -a is given, then all available commands are
       printed on the standard output.
       If a perf command is named, a manual page for that command is brought
       up. The man program is used by default for this purpose, but this can
       be overridden by other options or configuration variables.
       Note that perf --help ... is identical to perf help ... because the
       former is internally converted into the latter.
