       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcscat() function shall append a copy of the wide-character
       string pointed to by ws2 (including the terminating null wide-
       character code) to the end of the wide-character string pointed to by
       ws1.  The initial wide-character code of ws2 shall overwrite the null
       wide-character code at the end of ws1.  If copying takes place
       between objects that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
