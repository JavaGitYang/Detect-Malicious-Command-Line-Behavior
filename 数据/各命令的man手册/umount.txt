       umount.nfs and umount.nfs4 are a part of nfs(5) utilities package,
       which provides NFS client functionality.
       umount.nfs4 and umount.nfs are meant to be used by the umount(8)
       command for unmounting NFS shares. This subcommand, however, can also
       be used as a standalone command with limited functionality.
       dir is the directory on which the file system is mounted.
