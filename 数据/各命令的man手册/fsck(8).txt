       fsck is used to check and optionally repair one or more Linux
       filesystems.  filesys can be a device name (e.g.  /dev/hdc1,
       /dev/sdb2), a mount point (e.g.  /, /usr, /home), or an ext2 label or
       UUID specifier (e.g.  UUID=8868abf6-88c5-4a83-98b8-bfc24057f7bd or
       LABEL=root).  Normally, the fsck program will try to handle
       filesystems on different physical disk drives in parallel to reduce
       the total amount of time needed to check all of them.
       If no filesystems are specified on the command line, and the -A
       option is not specified, fsck will default to checking filesystems in
       /etc/fstab serially.  This is equivalent to the -As options.
       The exit code returned by fsck is the sum of the following
       conditions:
              0      No errors
              1      Filesystem errors corrected
              2      System should be rebooted
              4      Filesystem errors left uncorrected
              8      Operational error
              16     Usage or syntax error
              32     Checking canceled by user request
              128    Shared-library error
       The exit code returned when multiple filesystems are checked is the
       bit-wise OR of the exit codes for each filesystem that is checked.
       In actuality, fsck is simply a front-end for the various filesystem
       checkers (fsck.fstype) available under Linux.  The filesystem-
       specific checker is searched for in the PATH environment variable. If
       the PATH is undefined then fallback to "/sbin".
       Please see the filesystem-specific checker manual pages for further
       details.
