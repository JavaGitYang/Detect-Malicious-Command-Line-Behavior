       ausearch_add_item adds an expression to the current audit search
       expression.  The search conditions can then be used to scan logs,
       files, or buffers for something of interest.  The expression
       parameter contains an expression, as specified in
       ausearch-expression(5).
       The how parameter determines how this search expression will affect
       the existing search expression, if one is already defined.  The
       possible values are:
              AUSEARCH_RULE_CLEAR
                     Clear the current search expression, if any, and use
                     only this search expression.
              AUSEARCH_RULE_OR
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E || this_search_expression).
              AUSEARCH_RULE_AND
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E && this_search_expression).
