       sched_setparam() sets the scheduling parameters associated with the
       scheduling policy for the process identified by pid.  If pid is zero,
       then the parameters of the calling process are set.  The
       interpretation of the argument param depends on the scheduling policy
       of the process identified by pid.  See sched(7) for a description of
       the scheduling policies supported under Linux.
       sched_getparam() retrieves the scheduling parameters for the process
       identified by pid.  If pid is zero, then the parameters of the
       calling process are retrieved.
       sched_setparam() checks the validity of param for the scheduling
       policy of the thread.  The value param->sched_priority must lie
       within the range given by sched_get_priority_min(2) and
       sched_get_priority_max(2).
       For a discussion of the privileges and resource limits related to
       scheduling priority and policy, see sched(7).
       POSIX systems on which sched_setparam() and sched_getparam() are
       available define _POSIX_PRIORITY_SCHEDULING in <unistd.h>.
