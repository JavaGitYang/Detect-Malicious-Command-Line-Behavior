       The ovs-tcpundump program reads tcpdump -xx output on stdin, looking
       for hexadecimal packet data, and dumps each Ethernet as a single
       hexadecimal string on stdout.  This format is suitable for use with
       the ofproto/trace command supported by ovs-vswitchd(8) via
       ovs-appctl(8).
       At least two -x or -X options must be given, otherwise the output
       will omit the Ethernet header, which prevents the output from being
       using with ofproto/trace.
