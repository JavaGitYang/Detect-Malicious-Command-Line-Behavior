       The set of instances for performance metrics returned from a
       pmFetch(3) call may be filtered or restricted using an instance
       profile.  There is one instance profile for each context the
       application creates at the Performance Metrics Application
       Programming Interface (PMAPI), and each instance profile may include
       instances from one or more instance domains (see pmLookupDesc(3)).
       pmDelProfile may be used to delete instance specifications from the
       instance profile of the current PMAPI context.
       In the simplest variant, the list of instances identified by the
       instlist argument for the indom instance domain are removed from the
       instance profile.  The list of instance identifiers contains numinst
       values.
       The indom value would normally be extracted from a call to
       pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance metric, and the
       instances in instlist would typically be determined by calls to
       pmGetInDom(3) or pmLookupInDom(3).
       If indom equals PM_INDOM_NULL or numinst is zero, then all instance
       domains are selected for deletion.  If instlist is NULL, then all
       instances in the selected domain(s) are removed from the profile.
       To disable all available instances in all domains, use
       pmDelProfile(PM_INDOM_NULL, 0, NULL).  This is the only situation in
       which indom may be PM_INDOM_NULL.
