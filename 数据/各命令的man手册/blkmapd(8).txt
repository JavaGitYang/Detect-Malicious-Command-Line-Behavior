       The blkmapd daemon performs device discovery and mapping for the
       parallel NFS (pNFS) block layout client [RFC5663].
       The pNFS block layout protocol builds a complex storage hierarchy
       from a set of simple volumes.  These simple volumes are addressed by
       content, using a signature on the volume to uniquely name each one.
       The daemon locates a volume by examining each block device in the
       system for the given signature.
       The topology typically consists of a hierarchy of volumes built by
       striping, slicing, and concatenating the simple volumes.  The blkmapd
       daemon uses the device-mapper driver to construct logical devices
       that reflect the server topology, and passes these devices to the
       kernel for use by the pNFS block layout client.
