       /usr/local/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet controls the limits which the program
       lxc-user-nic places on network interfaces which an unprivileged user
       may create.
   CONFIGURATION
       This file consists of multiple entries, one per line, of the form:
       user type bridge number
       or
       @group type bridge number
       Where
       user   is the username to whom this entry applies.
       @group is the groupname to which this entry applies.
       type   is the type of network interface being allowed. Only veth is
              currently supported.
       bridge is the bridge to which the network interfaces may be attached,
              for instance lxcbr0.
       number is the number or quota of network interfaces of the given type
              which the given user or group may attach to the given bridge,
              for instance 2.
       Since a user can be specified both by username as well as one or more
       usergroups, it is possible that several configuration lines enable
       that user to create network interfaces. In such cases, any interfaces
       create are counted towards the quotas of the user or group in the
       order in which they appear in the file. If the quota of one line is
       full, the rest will be parsed until one is found or the end of the
       file.
