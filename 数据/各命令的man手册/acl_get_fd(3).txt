     The acl_get_fd() function retrieves the access ACL associated with the
     file referred to by fd.  The ACL is placed into working storage and
     acl_get_fd() returns a pointer to that storage.
     In order to read an ACL from an object, a process must have read access
     to the object's attributes.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‚Äê
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_get_fd() as an
     argument.
