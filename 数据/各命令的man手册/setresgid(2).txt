       setresuid() sets the real user ID, the effective user ID, and the
       saved set-user-ID of the calling process.
       An unprivileged process may change its real UID, effective UID, and
       saved set-user-ID, each to one of: the current real UID, the current
       effective UID or the current saved set-user-ID.
       A privileged process (on Linux, one having the CAP_SETUID capability)
       may set its real UID, effective UID, and saved set-user-ID to
       arbitrary values.
       If one of the arguments equals -1, the corresponding value is not
       changed.
       Regardless of what changes are made to the real UID, effective UID,
       and saved set-user-ID, the filesystem UID is always set to the same
       value as the (possibly new) effective UID.
       Completely analogously, setresgid() sets the real GID, effective GID,
       and saved set-group-ID of the calling process (and always modifies
       the filesystem GID to be the same as the effective GID), with the
       same restrictions for unprivileged processes.
