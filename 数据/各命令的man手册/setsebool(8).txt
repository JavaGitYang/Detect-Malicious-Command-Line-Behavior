       setsebool sets the current state of a particular SELinux boolean or a
       list of booleans to a given value. The value may be 1 or true or on
       to enable the boolean, or 0 or false or off to disable it.
       Without the -P option, only the current boolean value is affected;
       the boot-time default settings are not changed.
       If the -P option is given, all pending values are written to the
       policy file on disk. So they will be persistent across reboots.
       If the -N option is given, the policy on disk is not reloaded into
       the kernel.
       If the -V option is given, verbose error messages will be printed
       from semanage libraries.
