       The Socket backend to slapd(8) uses an external program to handle
       queries, similarly to slapd-shell(5).  However, in this case the
       external program listens on a Unix domain socket.  This makes it
       possible to have a pool of processes, which persist between requests.
       This allows multithreaded operation and a higher level of efficiency.
       The external program must have been started independently; slapd(8)
       itself will not start it.
       This module may also be used as an overlay on top of some other
       database.  Use as an overlay allows external actions to be triggered
       in response to operations on the main database.
