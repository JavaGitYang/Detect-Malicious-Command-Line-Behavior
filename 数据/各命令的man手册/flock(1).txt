       This utility manages flock(2) locks from within shell scripts or from
       the command line.
       The first and second of the above forms wrap the lock around the
       execution of a command, in a manner similar to su(1) or newgrp(1).
       They lock a specified file or directory, which is created (assuming
       appropriate permissions) if it does not already exist.  By default,
       if the lock cannot be immediately acquired, flock waits until the
       lock is available.
       The third form uses an open file by its file descriptor number.  See
       the examples below for how that can be used.
