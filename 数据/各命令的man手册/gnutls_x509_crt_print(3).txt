       This function will pretty print a X.509 certificate, suitable for
       display to a human.
       If the format is GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_FULL then all fields of the
       certificate will be output, on multiple lines.  The
       GNUTLS_CRT_PRINT_ONELINE format will generate one line with some
       selected fields, which is useful for logging purposes.
       The output  out needs to be deallocated using gnutls_free().
