       The pthread_attr_getschedparam() and pthread_attr_setschedparam()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the scheduling parameter
       attributes in the attr argument. The contents of the param structure
       are defined in the <sched.h> header. For the SCHED_FIFO and SCHED_RR
       policies, the only required member of param is sched_priority.
       For the SCHED_SPORADIC policy, the required members of the param
       structure are sched_priority, sched_ss_low_priority,
       sched_ss_repl_period, sched_ss_init_budget, and sched_ss_max_repl.
       The specified sched_ss_repl_period must be greater than or equal to
       the specified sched_ss_init_budget for the function to succeed; if it
       is not, then the function shall fail. The value of sched_ss_max_repl
       shall be within the inclusive range [1,{SS_REPL_MAX}] for the
       function to succeed; if not, the function shall fail.  It is
       unspecified whether the sched_ss_repl_period and sched_ss_init_budget
       values are stored as provided by this function or are rounded to
       align with the resolution of the clock being used.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getschedparam() or pthread_attr_setschedparam() does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
