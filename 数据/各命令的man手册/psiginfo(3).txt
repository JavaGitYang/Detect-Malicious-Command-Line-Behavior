       The psignal() function displays a message on stderr consisting of the
       string s, a colon, a space, a string describing the signal number
       sig, and a trailing newline.  If the string s is NULL or empty, the
       colon and space are omitted.  If sig is invalid, the message
       displayed will indicate an unknown signal.
       The psiginfo() function is like psignal(), except that it displays
       information about the signal described by pinfo, which should point
       to a valid siginfo_t structure.  As well as the signal description,
       psiginfo() displays information about the origin of the signal, and
       other information relevant to the signal (e.g., the relevant memory
       address for hardware-generated signals, the child process ID for
       SIGCHLD, and the user ID and process ID of the sender, for signals
       set using kill(2) or sigqueue(3)).
       The array sys_siglist holds the signal description strings indexed by
       signal number.
