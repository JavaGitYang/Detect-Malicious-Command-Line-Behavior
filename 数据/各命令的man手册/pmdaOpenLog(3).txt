       pmdaOpenLog redirects stderr to the logfile specified in the dispatch
       structure, set by the previous call to pmdaDaemon(3) or
       pmdaGetOpt(3).  The first line of the log file will detail the name
       of the calling process, the host the process is running on, and the
       current time.  In addition, the log is appended with the exit time of
       the process by a routine registered with atexit(3).
