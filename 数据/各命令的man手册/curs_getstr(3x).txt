       The function getstr is equivalent to a series of calls to getch,
       until a newline or carriage return is received (the terminating
       character is not included in the returned string).  The resulting
       value is placed in the area pointed to by the character pointer str.
       wgetnstr reads at most n characters, thus preventing a possible
       overflow of the input buffer.  Any attempt to enter more characters
       (other than the terminating newline or carriage return) causes a
       beep.  Function keys also cause a beep and are ignored.  The getnstr
       function reads from the stdscr default window.
       The user's erase and kill characters are interpreted.  If keypad mode
       is on for the window, KEY_LEFT and KEY_BACKSPACE are both considered
       equivalent to the user's kill character.
       Characters input are echoed only if echo is currently on.  In that
       case, backspace is echoed as deletion of the previous character
       (typically a left motion).
