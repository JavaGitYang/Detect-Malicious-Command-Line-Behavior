       selinux_restorecon_xattr() returns a linked list of dir_xattr
       structures containing information described below based on:
              pathname containing a directory tree to be searched for
              security.restorecon_last extended attribute entries.
              xattr_flags contains options as follows:
                     SELINUX_RESTORECON_XATTR_RECURSE recursively descend
                     directories.
                     SELINUX_RESTORECON_XATTR_DELETE_NONMATCH_DIGESTS delete
                     non-matching digests from each directory in pathname.
                     SELINUX_RESTORECON_XATTR_DELETE_ALL_DIGESTS delete all
                     digests from each directory in pathname.
                     SELINUX_RESTORECON_XATTR_IGNORE_MOUNTS do not read
                     /proc/mounts to obtain a list of non-seclabel mounts to
                     be excluded from the search.
                     Setting SELINUX_RESTORECON_XATTR_IGNORE_MOUNTS is
                     useful where there is a non-seclabel fs mounted with a
                     seclabel fs mounted on a directory below this.
              xattr_list is the returned pointer to a linked list of
              dir_xattr structures, each containing the following
              information:
                     struct dir_xattr {
                         char *directory;
                         char *digest;    /* Printable hex encoded string */
                         enum digest_result result;
                         struct dir_xattr *next;
                     };
              The result entry is enumerated as follows:
                     enum digest_result {
                         MATCH = 0,
                         NOMATCH,
                         DELETED_MATCH,
                         DELETED_NOMATCH,
                         ERROR
                     };
              xattr_list must be set to NULL before calling
              selinux_restorecon_xattr(3).  The caller is responsible for
              freeing the returned xattr_list entries in the linked list.
