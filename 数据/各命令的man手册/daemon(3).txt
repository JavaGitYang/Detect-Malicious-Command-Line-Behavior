       The daemon() function is for programs wishing to detach themselves
       from the controlling terminal and run in the background as system
       daemons.
       If nochdir is zero, daemon() changes the process's current working
       directory to the root directory ("/"); otherwise, the current working
       directory is left unchanged.
       If noclose is zero, daemon() redirects standard input, standard
       output and standard error to /dev/null; otherwise, no changes are
       made to these file descriptors.
