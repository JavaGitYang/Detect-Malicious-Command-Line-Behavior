       The getent command displays entries from databases supported by the
       Name Service Switch libraries, which are configured in
       /etc/nsswitch.conf.  If one or more key arguments are provided, then
       only the entries that match the supplied keys will be displayed.
       Otherwise, if no key is provided, all entries will be displayed
       (unless the database does not support enumeration).
       The database may be any of those supported by the GNU C Library,
       listed below:
          ahosts    When no key is provided, use sethostent(3),
                    gethostent(3), and endhostent(3) to enumerate the hosts
                    database.  This is identical to using hosts.  When one
                    or more key arguments are provided, pass each key in
                    succession to getaddrinfo(3) with the address family
                    AF_UNSPEC, enumerating each socket address structure
                    returned.
          ahostsv4  Same as ahosts, but use the address family AF_INET.
          ahostsv6  Same as ahosts, but use the address family AF_INET6.
                    The call to getaddrinfo(3) in this case includes the
                    AI_V4MAPPED flag.
          aliases   When no key is provided, use setaliasent(3),
                    getaliasent(3), and endaliasent(3) to enumerate the
                    aliases database.  When one or more key arguments are
                    provided, pass each key in succession to
                    getaliasbyname(3) and display the result.
          ethers    When one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    key in succession to ether_aton(3) and ether_hostton(3)
                    until a result is obtained, and display the result.
                    Enumeration is not supported on ethers, so a key must be
                    provided.
          group     When no key is provided, use setgrent(3), getgrent(3),
                    and endgrent(3) to enumerate the group database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    numeric key to getgrgid(3) and each nonnumeric key to
                    getgrnam(3) and display the result.
          gshadow   When no key is provided, use setsgent(3), getsgent(3),
                    and endsgent(3) to enumerate the gshadow database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each key in
                    succession to getsgnam(3) and display the result.
          hosts     When no key is provided, use sethostent(3),
                    gethostent(3), and endhostent(3) to enumerate the hosts
                    database.  When one or more key arguments are provided,
                    pass each key to gethostbyaddr(3) or gethostbyname2(3),
                    depending on whether a call to inet_pton(3) indicates
                    that the key is an IPv6 or IPv4 address or not, and
                    display the result.
          initgroups
                    When one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    key in succession to getgrouplist(3) and display the
                    result.  Enumeration is not supported on initgroups, so
                    a key must be provided.
          netgroup  When one key is provided, pass the key to setnetgrent(3)
                    and, using getnetgrent(3) display the resulting string
                    triple (hostname, username, domainname).  Alternatively,
                    three keys may be provided, which are interpreted as the
                    hostname, username and domainname to match to a netgroup
                    name via innetgr(3).  Enumeration is not supported on
                    netgroup, so either one or three keys must be provided.
          networks  When no key is provided, use setnetent(3), getnetent(3),
                    and endnetent(3) to enumerate the networks database.
                    When one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    numeric key to getnetbyaddr(3) and each nonnumeric key
                    to getnetbyname(3) and display the result.
          passwd    When no key is provided, use setpwent(3), getpwent(3),
                    and endpwent(3) to enumerate the passwd database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    numeric key to getpwuid(3) and each nonnumeric key to
                    getpwnam(3) and display the result.
          protocols When no key is provided, use setprotoent(3),
                    getprotoent(3), and endprotoent(3) to enumerate the
                    protocols database.  When one or more key arguments are
                    provided, pass each numeric key to getprotobynumber(3)
                    and each nonnumeric key to getprotobyname(3) and display
                    the result.
          rpc       When no key is provided, use setrpcent(3), getrpcent(3),
                    and endrpcent(3) to enumerate the rpc database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each
                    numeric key to getrpcbynumber(3) and each nonnumeric key
                    to getrpcbyname(3) and display the result.
          services  When no key is provided, use setservent(3),
                    getservent(3), and endservent(3) to enumerate the
                    services database.  When one or more key arguments are
                    provided, pass each numeric key to getservbynumber(3)
                    and each nonnumeric key to getservbyname(3) and display
                    the result.
          shadow    When no key is provided, use setspent(3), getspent(3),
                    and endspent(3) to enumerate the shadow database.  When
                    one or more key arguments are provided, pass each key in
                    succession to getspnam(3) and display the result.
