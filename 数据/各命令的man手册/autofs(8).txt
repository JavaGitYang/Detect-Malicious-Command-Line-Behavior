       autofs controls the operation of the automount(8) daemon(s) running
       on the Linux system. Usually autofs is invoked at system boot time
       with the start parameter and at shutdown time with the stop
       parameter. Service control actions can also be manually invoked by
       the system administrator to shut down, restart, reload or obtain
       service status.
