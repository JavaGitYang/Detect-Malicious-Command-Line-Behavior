       pmnsmerge merges multiple instances of a Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP).
       Each infile argument names a file that includes the root of a PMNS,
       of the form
                 root {
                     /* arbitrary stuff */
                 }
       The order in which the infile files are processed is determined by
       the presence or absence of embedded control lines of the form #define
       _DATESTAMP YYYYMMDD
       Files without a control line are processed first and in the order
       they appear on the command line.  The other files are then processed
       in order of ascending _DATESTAMP.
       The -a option suppresses the argument re-ordering and processes all
       files in the order they appear on the command line.
       The merging proceeds by matching names in PMNS, only those new names
       in each PMNS are considered, and these are added after any existing
       metrics with the longest possible matching prefix in their names.
       For example, merging these two input PMNS
                 root {                    root {
                                               surprise  1:1:3
                     mine       1:1:1          mine      1:1:1
                     foo                       foo
                                               yawn
                     yours      1:1:2
                 }                         }
                 foo {                     foo {
                     fumble     1:2:1
                                               mumble    1:2:3
                     stumble    1:2:2          stumble   1:2:2
                 }                         }
                                           yawn {
                                               sleepy    1:3:1
                                           }
       Produces the resulting PMNS in out.
                 root {
                     mine      1:1:1
                     foo
                     yours     1:1:2
                     surprise  1:1:3
                     yawn
                 }
                 foo {
                     fumble    1:2:1
                     stumble   1:2:2
                     mumble    1:2:3
                 }
                 yawn {
                     sleepy    1:3:1
                 }
       To avoid accidental over-writing of PMNS files, outfile is expected
       to not exist when pmnsmerge starts.  The -f option allows an existing
       outfile to be unlinked (if possible) and truncated before writing
       starts.
       Normally duplicate names for the same Performance Metric Identifier
       (PMID) in a PMNS are allowed.  The -d option is the default option
       and is included for backwards compatibility.  The -x option reverses
       the default and pmnsmerge will report an error and exit with a non-
       zero status if a duplicate name is found for a PMID in any of the
       input PMNS files or in the merged output PMNS.
       The -v option produces one line of diagnostic output as each infile
       is processed.
       Once all of the merging has been completed, pmnsmerge will attempt to
       load the resultant namespace using pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) - if this
       fails for any reason, outfile will still be created, but pmnsmerge
       will report the problem and exit with non-zero status.
       Using pmnsmerge with a single input argument allows that PMNS file to
       be checked.  In addition to syntactic checking, specifying -x will
       also enable a check for duplicate names for all PMIDs.
