       sd_bus_message_read_basic() reads a basic type from a message and
       advances the read position in the message. The set of basic types and
       their ascii codes passed in type are described in the D-Bus
       Specification[1].
       If p is not NULL, it should contain a pointer to an appropriate
       object. For example, if type is 'y', the object passed in p should
       have type uint8_t *. If type is 's', the object passed in p should
       have type const char **. Note that, if the basic type is a pointer
       (e.g., const char * in the case of a string), the pointer is only
       borrowed and the contents must be copied if they are to be used after
       the end of the messages lifetime. Similarly, during the lifetime of
       such a pointer, the message must not be modified.
       If there is no object of the specified type at the current position
       in the message, an error is returned.
