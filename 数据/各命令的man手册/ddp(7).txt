       Linux implements the AppleTalk protocols described in Inside
       AppleTalk.  Only the DDP layer and AARP are present in the kernel.
       They are designed to be used via the netatalk protocol libraries.
       This page documents the interface for those who wish or need to use
       the DDP layer directly.
       The communication between AppleTalk and the user program works using
       a BSD-compatible socket interface.  For more information on sockets,
       see socket(7).
       An AppleTalk socket is created by calling the socket(2) function with
       a AF_APPLETALK socket family argument.  Valid socket types are
       SOCK_DGRAM to open a ddp socket or SOCK_RAW to open a raw socket.
       protocol is the AppleTalk protocol to be received or sent.  For
       SOCK_RAW you must specify ATPROTO_DDP.
       Raw sockets may be opened only by a process with effective user ID 0
       or when the process has the CAP_NET_RAW capability.
   Address format
       An AppleTalk socket address is defined as a combination of a network
       number, a node number, and a port number.
           struct at_addr {
               unsigned short s_net;
               unsigned char  s_node;
           };
           struct sockaddr_atalk {
               sa_family_t    sat_family;    /* address family */
               unsigned char  sat_port;      /* port */
               struct at_addr sat_addr;      /* net/node */
           };
       sat_family is always set to AF_APPLETALK.  sat_port contains the
       port.  The port numbers below 129 are known as reserved ports.  Only
       processes with the effective user ID 0 or the CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
       capability may bind(2) to these sockets.  sat_addr is the host
       address.  The net member of struct at_addr contains the host network
       in network byte order.  The value of AT_ANYNET is a wildcard and also
       implies “this network.”  The node member of struct at_addr contains
       the host node number.  The value of AT_ANYNODE is a wildcard and also
       implies “this node.” The value of ATADDR_BCAST is a link local broad‐
       cast address.
   Socket options
       No protocol-specific socket options are supported.
   /proc interfaces
       IP supports a set of /proc interfaces to configure some global
       AppleTalk parameters.  The parameters can be accessed by reading or
       writing files in the directory /proc/sys/net/atalk/.
       aarp-expiry-time
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry
              expires.
       aarp-resolve-time
              The time interval (in seconds) before an AARP cache entry is
              resolved.
       aarp-retransmit-limit
              The number of retransmissions of an AARP query before the node
              is declared dead.
       aarp-tick-time
              The timer rate (in seconds) for the timer driving AARP.
       The default values match the specification and should never need to
       be changed.
   Ioctls
       All ioctls described in socket(7) apply to DDP.
