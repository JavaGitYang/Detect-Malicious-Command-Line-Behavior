       This function will sign the given hashed data using a signature
       algorithm supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are
       always used together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions
       may be used for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA-XXX for the DSA keys.
       You may use gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm() to determine
       the hash algorithm.
       The flags may be GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_TLS1_RSA or
       GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_SIGN_FLAG_RSA_PSS.  In the former case this function
       will ignore  hash_algo and perform a raw PKCS1 signature, and in the
       latter an RSA-PSS signature will be generated.
       Note that, not all algorithm support signing already hashed data.
       When signing with Ed25519, gnutls_privkey_sign_data() should be used.
