       This function will set the certificate's subject public key
       information explicitly. This is intended to be used in the cases
       where a single public key (e.g., RSA) can be used for multiple
       signature algorithms (RSA PKCS1-1.5, and RSA-PSS).
       To export the public key (i.e., the SubjectPublicKeyInfo part), check
       gnutls_pubkey_import_x509().
