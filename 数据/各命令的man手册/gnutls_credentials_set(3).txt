       Sets the needed credentials for the specified type.  E.g. username,
       password - or public and private keys etc.  The  cred parameter is a
       structure that depends on the specified type and on the current
       session (client or server).
       In order to minimize memory usage, and share credentials between
       several threads gnutls keeps a pointer to cred, and not the whole
       cred structure.  Thus you will have to keep the structure allocated
       until you call gnutls_deinit().
       For GNUTLS_CRD_ANON,  cred should be gnutls_anon_client_credentials_t
       in case of a client.  In case of a server it should be
       gnutls_anon_server_credentials_t.
       For GNUTLS_CRD_SRP,  cred should be gnutls_srp_client_credentials_t
       in case of a client, and gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t, in case of
       a server.
       For GNUTLS_CRD_CERTIFICATE,  cred should be
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t.
