       nss-resolve is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
       functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc) enabling it to resolve
       host names via the systemd-resolved(8) local network name resolution
       service. It replaces the nss-dns plug-in module that traditionally
       resolves hostnames via DNS.
       To activate the NSS module, add "resolve" to the line starting with
       "hosts:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf. Specifically, it is recommended to
       place "resolve" early in /etc/nsswitch.conf's "hosts:" line (but
       after the "files" or "mymachines" entries), right before the "dns"
       entry if it exists, followed by "[!UNAVAIL=return]", to ensure DNS
       queries are always routed via systemd-resolved(8) if it is running,
       but are routed to nss-dns if this service is not available.
       Note that systemd-resolved will synthesize DNS resource records in a
       few cases, for example for "localhost" and the current hostname, see
       systemd-resolved(8) for the full list. This duplicates the
       functionality of nss-myhostname(8), but it is still recommended (see
       examples below) to keep nss-myhostname configured in
       /etc/nsswitch.conf, to keep those names resolveable if
       systemd-resolved is not running.
