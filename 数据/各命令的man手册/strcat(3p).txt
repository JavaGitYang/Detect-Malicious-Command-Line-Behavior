       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The strcat() function shall append a copy of the string pointed to by
       s2 (including the terminating NUL character) to the end of the string
       pointed to by s1.  The initial byte of s2 overwrites the NUL
       character at the end of s1.  If copying takes place between objects
       that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
