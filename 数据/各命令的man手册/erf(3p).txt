       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       These functions shall compute the error function of their argument x,
       defined as:
              ${2 over sqrt pi} int from 0 to x e"^" " "{- t"^" 2" "} dt$
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
