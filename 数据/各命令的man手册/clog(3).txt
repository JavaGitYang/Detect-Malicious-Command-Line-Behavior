       These functions calculate the complex natural logarithm of z, with a
       branch cut along the negative real axis.
       The logarithm clog() is the inverse function of the exponential
       cexp(3).  Thus, if y = clog(z), then z = cexp(y).  The imaginary part
       of y is chosen in the interval [-pi,pi].
       One has:
           clog(z) = log(cabs(z)) + I * carg(z)
       Note that z close to zero will cause an overflow.
