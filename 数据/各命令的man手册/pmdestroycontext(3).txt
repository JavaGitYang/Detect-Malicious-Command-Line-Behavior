       An application using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent contexts, each
       associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some
       host, or an archive log of performance metrics as created by
       pmlogger(1).
       pmDestroyContext destroys the PMAPI context identified by handle.
       Typically this would imply some termination of a connection to a PMCD
       or closing an archive log file, and orderly clean-up.
       The context must have been previously created using pmNewContext(3)
       or pmDupContext(3).
       On success, pmDestroyContext returns zero.  If handle was the current
       PMAPI context, then the current context becomes undefined.  This
       means the application must explicitly re-establish a valid PMAPI
       context with pmUseContext(3), or create a new context with
       pmNewContext(3) or pmDupContext(3), before the next PMAPI operation
       that requires a PMAPI context.
