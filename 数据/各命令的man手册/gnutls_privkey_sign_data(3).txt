       This function will sign the given data using a signature algorithm
       supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used
       together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may be used
       for the RSA algorithm, but only the SHA family for the DSA keys.
       You may use gnutls_pubkey_get_preferred_hash_algorithm() to determine
       the hash algorithm.
