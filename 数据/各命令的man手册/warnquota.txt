       The warnquota.conf file stores a configuration for warnquota(8) tool
       which is used to notify a user or a group who exceeds its disk quota
       limits.
       The syntax is an option name followed by an equal sign and the option
       value.  White space characters surrounding the option names and
       values are allowed.
       Empty lines or lines starting with a hash sign or a semicolon are
       ignored.
       An option value can but does not have to be quoted. The value can
       span across multiple lines provided each previous line ends with a
       backslash.
       Some option values can contain formatting sequences which will be
       expanded to their respective values. Following sequences are
       recognized:
       %d                  domain name
       %h                  host name
       %i, %s              user or group name
       %%                  literal % character
       |                   new-line character
