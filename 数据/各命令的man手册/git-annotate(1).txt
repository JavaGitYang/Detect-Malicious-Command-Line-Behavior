       Annotates each line in the given file with information from the
       commit which introduced the line. Optionally annotates from a given
       revision.
       The only difference between this command and git-blame(1) is that
       they use slightly different output formats, and this command exists
       only for backward compatibility to support existing scripts, and
       provide a more familiar command name for people coming from other SCM
       systems.
