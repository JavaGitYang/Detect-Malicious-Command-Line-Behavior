       This system call is obsolete.  Use utimensat(2) instead.
       The futimesat() system call operates in exactly the same way as
       utimes(2), except for the differences described in this manual page.
       If the pathname given in pathname is relative, then it is interpreted
       relative to the directory referred to by the file descriptor dirfd
       (rather than relative to the current working directory of the calling
       process, as is done by utimes(2) for a relative pathname).
       If pathname is relative and dirfd is the special value AT_FDCWD, then
       pathname is interpreted relative to the current working directory of
       the calling process (like utimes(2)).
       If pathname is absolute, then dirfd is ignored.
