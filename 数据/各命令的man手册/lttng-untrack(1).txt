       The lttng untrack commands removes one or more entries from a
       resource tracker.
       See lttng-track(1) to learn more about LTTng trackers.
       The untrack command removes specific resources from a tracker. The
       resources to remove must have been precedently added by
       lttng-track(1). It is also possible to remove all the resources from
       the whitelist using the --all option.
       As of this version, the only available tracker is the PID tracker.
   Example
       One common operation is to create a tracing session (see
       lttng-create(1)), remove all the entries from the PID tracker
       whitelist, start tracing, and then manually track PIDs while tracing
       is active.
       Assume the maximum system PID is 7 for this example.
       Command:
           $ lttng create
       Initial whitelist:
           [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
       Command:
           $ lttng untrack --userspace --pid --all
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
       Commands:
           $ lttng enable-event --userspace ...
           $ lttng start
           $ # ...
           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=3,5
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [5] [ ] [ ]
       Command:
           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=2
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [ ] [2] [3] [ ] [5] [ ] [ ]
