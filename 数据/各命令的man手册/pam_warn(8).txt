       pam_warn is a PAM module that logs the service, terminal, user,
       remote user and remote host to syslog(3). The items are not probed
       for, but instead obtained from the standard PAM items. The module
       always returns PAM_IGNORE, indicating that it does not want to affect
       the authentication process.
