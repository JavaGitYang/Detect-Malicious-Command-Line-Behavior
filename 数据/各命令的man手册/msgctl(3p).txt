       The msgctl() function operates on XSI message queues (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.225, Message Queue).
       It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
       realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The msgctl() function shall provide message control operations as
       specified by cmd.  The following values for cmd, and the message
       control operations they specify, are:
       IPC_STAT    Place the current value of each member of the msqid_ds
                   data structure associated with msqid into the structure
                   pointed to by buf.  The contents of this structure are
                   defined in <sys/msg.h>.
       IPC_SET     Set the value of the following members of the msqid_ds
                   data structure associated with msqid to the corresponding
                   value found in the structure pointed to by buf:
                       msg_perm.uid
                       msg_perm.gid
                       msg_perm.mode
                       msg_qbytes
                   Also, the msg_ctime timestamp shall be set to the current
                   time, as described in Section 2.7.1, IPC General
                   Description.
                   IPC_SET can only be executed by a process with
                   appropriate privileges or that has an effective user ID
                   equal to the value of msg_perm.cuid or msg_perm.uid in
                   the msqid_ds data structure associated with msqid.  Only
                   a process with appropriate privileges can raise the value
                   of msg_qbytes.
       IPC_RMID    Remove the message queue identifier specified by msqid
                   from the system and destroy the message queue and
                   msqid_ds data structure associated with it. IPC_RMD can
                   only be executed by a process with appropriate privileges
                   or one that has an effective user ID equal to the value
                   of msg_perm.cuid or msg_perm.uid in the msqid_ds data
                   structure associated with msqid.
