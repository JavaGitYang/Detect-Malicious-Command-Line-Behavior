       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The gets() function shall read bytes from the standard input stream,
       stdin, into the array pointed to by s, until a <newline> is read or
       an end-of-file condition is encountered. Any <newline> shall be
       discarded and a null byte shall be placed immediately after the last
       byte read into the array.
       The gets() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetc(), fgets(), fread(), fscanf(), getc(), getchar(),
       getdelim(), getline(), gets(), or scanf() using stream that returns
       data not supplied by a prior call to ungetc().
