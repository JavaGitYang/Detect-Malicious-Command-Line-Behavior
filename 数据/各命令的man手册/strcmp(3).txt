       The strcmp() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It returns
       an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found,
       respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
       The strncmp() function is similar, except it compares only the first
       (at most) n bytes of s1 and s2.
