       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The ungetc() function shall push the byte specified by c (converted
       to an unsigned char) back onto the input stream pointed to by stream.
       The pushed-back bytes shall be returned by subsequent reads on that
       stream in the reverse order of their pushing. A successful
       intervening call (with the stream pointed to by stream) to a file-
       positioning function (fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind()) or
       fflush() shall discard any pushed-back bytes for the stream. The
       external storage corresponding to the stream shall be unchanged.
       One byte of push-back shall be provided. If ungetc() is called too
       many times on the same stream without an intervening read or file-
       positioning operation on that stream, the operation may fail.
       If the value of c equals that of the macro EOF, the operation shall
       fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.
       A successful call to ungetc() shall clear the end-of-file indicator
       for the stream. The value of the file-position indicator for the
       stream after all pushed-back bytes have been read, or discarded by
       calling fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind() (but not fflush()),
       shall be the same as it was before the bytes were pushed back. The
       file-position indicator is decremented by each successful call to
       ungetc(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is unspecified
       after the call.
