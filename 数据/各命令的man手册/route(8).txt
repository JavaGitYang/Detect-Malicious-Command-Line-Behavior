       Route manipulates the kernel's IP routing tables.  Its primary use is
       to set up static routes to specific hosts or networks via an
       interface after it has been configured with the ifconfig(8) program.
       When the add or del options are used, route modifies the routing
       tables.  Without these options, route displays the current contents
       of the routing tables.
