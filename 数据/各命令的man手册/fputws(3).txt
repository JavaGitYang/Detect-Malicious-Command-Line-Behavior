       The fputws() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       fputs(3) function.  It writes the wide-character string starting at
       ws, up to but not including the terminating null wide character
       (L'\0'), to stream.
       For a nonlocking counterpart, see unlocked_stdio(3).
