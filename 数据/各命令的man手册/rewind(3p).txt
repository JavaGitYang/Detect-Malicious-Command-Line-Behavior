       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The call:
           rewind(stream)
       shall be equivalent to:
           (void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)
       except that rewind() shall also clear the error indicator.
       Since rewind() does not return a value, an application wishing to
       detect errors should clear errno, then call rewind(), and if errno is
       non-zero, assume an error has occurred.
