       This function deinitializes the global data, that were initialized
       using gnutls_global_init().
       Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be
       explicitly called. GnuTLS will automatically deinitialize on library
       destructor. See gnutls_global_init() for disabling the implicit
       initialization/deinitialization.
