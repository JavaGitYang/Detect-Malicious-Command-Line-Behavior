       These functions shall retrieve information about users.
       The getpwent() function shall return a pointer to a structure
       containing the broken-out fields of an entry in the user database.
       Each entry in the user database contains a passwd structure. When
       first called, getpwent() shall return a pointer to a passwd structure
       containing the first entry in the user database. Thereafter, it shall
       return a pointer to a passwd structure containing the next entry in
       the user database. Successive calls can be used to search the entire
       user database.
       If an end-of-file or an error is encountered on reading, getpwent()
       shall return a null pointer.
       An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose
       further implementation-defined restrictions on accessing the user
       database. In particular, the system may deny the existence of some or
       all of the user database entries associated with users other than the
       caller.
       The setpwent() function effectively rewinds the user database to
       allow repeated searches.
       The endpwent() function may be called to close the user database when
       processing is complete.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
