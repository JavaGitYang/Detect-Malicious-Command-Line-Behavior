       The aio_fsync() function does a sync on all outstanding asynchronous
       I/O operations associated with aiocbp->aio_fildes.  (See aio(7) for a
       description of the aiocb structure.)
       More precisely, if op is O_SYNC, then all currently queued I/O
       operations shall be completed as if by a call of fsync(2), and if op
       is O_DSYNC, this call is the asynchronous analog of fdatasync(2).
       Note that this is a request only; it does not wait for I/O
       completion.
       Apart from aio_fildes, the only field in the structure pointed to by
       aiocbp that is used by this call is the aio_sigevent field (a
       sigevent structure, described in sigevent(7)), which indicates the
       desired type of asynchronous notification at completion.  All other
       fields are ignored.
