       the fw filter allows to classify packets based on a previously set
       fwmark by iptables.  If it is identical to the filter's handle, the
       filter matches.  iptables allows to mark single packets with the MARK
       target, or whole connections using CONNMARK.  The benefit of using
       this filter instead of doing the heavy-lifting with tc itself is that
       on one hand it might be convenient to keep packet filtering and
       classification in one place, possibly having to match a packet just
       once, and on the other users familiar with iptables but not tc will
       have a less hard time adding QoS to their setups.
