       The myisamchk utility gets information about your database tables or
       checks, repairs, or optimizes them.  myisamchk works with MyISAM
       tables (tables that have .MYD and .MYI files for storing data and
       indexes).
       The use of myisamchk with partitioned tables is not supported.
           Caution
           It is best to make a backup of a table before performing a table
           repair operation; under some circumstances the operation might
           cause data loss. Possible causes include but are not limited to
           file system errors.
       Invoke myisamchk like this:
           shell> myisamchk [options] tbl_name ...
       The options specify what you want myisamchk to do. They are described
       in the following sections. You can also get a list of options by
       invoking myisamchk --help.
       With no options, myisamchk simply checks your table as the default
       operation. To get more information or to tell myisamchk to take
       corrective action, specify options as described in the following
       discussion.
       tbl_name is the database table you want to check or repair. If you
       run myisamchk somewhere other than in the database directory, you
       must specify the path to the database directory, because myisamchk
       has no idea where the database is located. In fact, myisamchk does
       not actually care whether the files you are working on are located in
       a database directory. You can copy the files that correspond to a
       database table into some other location and perform recovery
       operations on them there.
       You can name several tables on the myisamchk command line if you
       wish. You can also specify a table by naming its index file (the file
       with the .MYI suffix). This allows you to specify all tables in a
       directory by using the pattern *.MYI. For example, if you are in a
       database directory, you can check all the MyISAM tables in that
       directory like this:
           shell> myisamchk *.MYI
       If you are not in the database directory, you can check all the
       tables there by specifying the path to the directory:
           shell> myisamchk /path/to/database_dir/*.MYI
       You can even check all tables in all databases by specifying a
       wildcard with the path to the MariaDB data directory:
           shell> myisamchk /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
       The recommended way to quickly check all MyISAM tables is:
           shell> myisamchk --silent --fast /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
       If you want to check all MyISAM tables and repair any that are
       corrupted, you can use the following command:
           shell> myisamchk --silent --force --fast --update-state \
                     --key_buffer_size=64M --sort_buffer_size=64M \
                     --read_buffer_size=1M --write_buffer_size=1M \
                     /path/to/datadir/*/*.MYI
       This command assumes that you have more than 64MB free. For more
       information about memory allocation with myisamchk, see the section
       called “MYISAMCHK MEMORY USAGE”.
           Important
           You must ensure that no other program is using the tables while
           you are running myisamchk. The most effective means of doing so
           is to shut down the MariaDB server while running myisamchk, or to
           lock all tables that myisamchk is being used on.
           Otherwise, when you run myisamchk, it may display the following
           error message:
               warning: clients are using or haven´t closed the table properly
           This means that you are trying to check a table that has been
           updated by another program (such as the mysqld server) that
           hasn´t yet closed the file or that has died without closing the
           file properly, which can sometimes lead to the corruption of one
           or more MyISAM tables.
           If mysqld is running, you must force it to flush any table
           modifications that are still buffered in memory by using FLUSH
           TABLES. You should then ensure that no one is using the tables
           while you are running myisamchk
           However, the easiest way to avoid this problem is to use CHECK
           TABLE instead of myisamchk to check tables.
       myisamchk supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [myisamchk] option file group.
