       avc_add_callback() is used to register callback functions on security
       events.  The purpose of this functionality is to allow userspace
       object managers to take additional action when a policy change,
       usually a policy reload, causes permissions to be granted or revoked.
       events is the bitwise-or of security events on which to register the
       callback; see SECURITY EVENTS below.
       ssid, tsid, tclass, and perms specify the source and target SID's,
       target class, and specific permissions that the callback wishes to
       monitor.  The special symbol SECSID_WILD may be passed as the source
       or target and will cause any SID to match.
       callback is the callback function provided by the userspace object
       manager.  The event argument indicates the security event which
       occurred; the remaining arguments are interpreted according to the
       event as described below.  The return value of the callback should be
       zero on success, -1 on error with errno set appropriately (but see
       RETURN VALUE below).
