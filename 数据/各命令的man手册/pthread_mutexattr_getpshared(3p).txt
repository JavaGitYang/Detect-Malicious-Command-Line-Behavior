       The pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value of
       the process-shared attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The pthread_mutexattr_setpshared() function shall set the process-
       shared attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to
       permit a mutex to be operated upon by any thread that has access to
       the memory where the mutex is allocated, even if the mutex is
       allocated in memory that is shared by multiple processes. If the
       process-shared attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the mutex shall
       only be operated upon by threads created within the same process as
       the thread that initialized the mutex; if threads of differing
       processes attempt to operate on such a mutex, the behavior is
       undefined. The default value of the attribute shall be
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_mutexattr_getpshared() or pthread_mutexattr_setpshared()
       does not refer to an initialized mutex attributes object.
