       The nice utility shall invoke a utility, requesting that it be run
       with a different nice value (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.240, Nice Value).  With no options, the
       executed utility shall be run with a nice value that is some
       implementation-defined quantity greater than or equal to the nice
       value of the current process. If the user lacks appropriate
       privileges to affect the nice value in the requested manner, the nice
       utility shall not affect the nice value; in this case, a warning
       message may be written to standard error, but this shall not prevent
       the invocation of utility or affect the exit status.
