       For use in error and diagnostic messages, pmEventFlagsStr returns a
       `human readable' version of the value flags, assuming this to be the
       er_flags field of a pmEventRecord or pmEventHighResRecord.  The
       pmEventFlagsStr_r function does the same, but stores the result in a
       user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for
       at least 64 bytes.
       The string value result from pmEventFlagsStr is held in a single
       static buffer, so the returned value is only valid until the next
       call to pmEventFlagsStr.
