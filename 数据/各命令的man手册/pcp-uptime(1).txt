       pcp-uptime gives a one line display of the following information.
       The current time, how long the system has been running, how many
       users are currently logged on, and the system load averages for the
       past 1, 5, and 15 minutes.
       When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
       -O/--origin, -Z/--timezone and several other pcp options become
       indirectly available.
       The current version of pcp-uptime can be queried using the
       -V/--version option.
