       col filters out reverse (and half-reverse) line feeds so the output
       is in the correct order, with only forward and half-forward line
       feeds.  It also replaces any whitespace characters with tabs where
       possible.  This can be useful in processing the output of nroff(1)
       and tbl(1).
       col reads from standard input and writes to standard output.
