       The set of instances for performance metrics returned from a
       pmFetch(3) call may be filtered or restricted using an instance
       profile.  There is one instance profile for each context the
       application creates at the Performance Metrics Application
       Programming Interface (PMAPI(3)), and each instance profile may
       include instances from one or more instance domains (see
       pmLookupDesc(3)).
       pmAddProfile may be used to add new instance specifications to the
       instance profile of the current PMAPI context.
       In the simplest variant, the list of instances identified by the
       instlist argument for the indom instance domain are added to the
       instance profile.  The list of instance identifiers contains numinst
       values.
       The indom value would normally be extracted from a call to
       pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance metric, and the
       instances in instlist would typically be determined by calls to
       pmGetInDom(3) or pmLookupInDom(3).
       To select all instances in all instance domains, use
          pmAddProfile(PM_INDOM_NULL, 0, (int *)0)
       This is the only case where indom may be equal to PM_INDOM_NULL.  If
       numinst is zero, or instlist is NULL, then all instances in indom are
       selected.
