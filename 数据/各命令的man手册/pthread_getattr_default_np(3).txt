       The pthread_setattr_default_np() function sets the default attributes
       used for creation of a new threadâ€”that is, the attributes that are
       used when pthread_create(3) is called with a second argument that is
       NULL.  The default attributes are set using the attributes supplied
       in *attr, a previously initialized thread attributes object.  Note
       the following details about the supplied attributes object:
       *  The attribute settings in the object must be valid.
       *  The stack address attribute must not be set in the object.
       *  Setting the stack size attribute to zero means leave the default
          stack size unchanged.
       The pthread_getattr_default_np() function initializes the thread
       attributes object referred to by attr so that it contains the default
       attributes used for thread creation.
