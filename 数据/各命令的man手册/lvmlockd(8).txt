       LVM commands use lvmlockd to coordinate access to shared storage.
       When LVM is used on devices shared by multiple hosts, locks will:
       · coordinate reading and writing of LVM metadata
       · validate caching of LVM metadata
       · prevent conflicting activation of logical volumes
       lvmlockd uses an external lock manager to perform basic locking.
       Lock manager (lock type) options are:
       · sanlock: places locks on disk within LVM storage.
       · dlm: uses network communication and a cluster manager.
