       The pthread_attr_getstack() and pthread_attr_setstack() functions,
       respectively, shall get and set the thread creation stack attributes
       stackaddr and stacksize in the attr object.
       The stack attributes specify the area of storage to be used for the
       created thread's stack. The base (lowest addressable byte) of the
       storage shall be stackaddr, and the size of the storage shall be
       stacksize bytes. The stacksize shall be at least {PTHREAD_STACK_MIN}.
       The pthread_attr_setstack() function may fail with [EINVAL] if
       stackaddr does not meet implementation-defined alignment
       requirements.  All pages within the stack described by stackaddr and
       stacksize shall be both readable and writable by the thread.
       If the pthread_attr_getstack() function is called before the
       stackaddr attribute has been set, the behavior is unspecified.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getstack() or pthread_attr_setstack() does not refer
       to an initialized thread attributes object.
