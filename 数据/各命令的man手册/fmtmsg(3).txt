       This function displays a message described by its arguments on the
       device(s) specified in the classification argument.  For messages
       written to stderr, the format depends on the MSGVERB environment
       variable.
       The label argument identifies the source of the message.  The string
       must consist of two colon separated parts where the first part has
       not more than 10 and the second part not more than 14 characters.
       The text argument describes the condition of the error.
       The action argument describes possible steps to recover from the
       error.  If it is printed, it is prefixed by "TO FIX: ".
       The tag argument is a reference to the online documentation where
       more information can be found.  It should contain the label value and
       a unique identification number.
   Dummy arguments
       Each of the arguments can have a dummy value.  The dummy
       classification value MM_NULLMC (0L) does not specify any output, so
       nothing is printed.  The dummy severity value NO_SEV (0) says that no
       severity is supplied.  The values MM_NULLLBL, MM_NULLTXT, MM_NULLACT,
       MM_NULLTAG are synonyms for ((char *) 0), the empty string, and
       MM_NULLSEV is a synonym for NO_SEV.
   The classification argument
       The classification argument is the sum of values describing 4 types
       of information.
       The first value defines the output channel.
       MM_PRINT    Output to stderr.
       MM_CONSOLE  Output to the system console.
       MM_PRINT | MM_CONSOLE
                   Output to both.
       The second value is the source of the error:
       MM_HARD     A hardware error occurred.
       MM_FIRM     A firmware error occurred.
       MM_SOFT     A software error occurred.
       The third value encodes the detector of the problem:
       MM_APPL     It is detected by an application.
       MM_UTIL     It is detected by a utility.
       MM_OPSYS    It is detected by the operating system.
       The fourth value shows the severity of the incident:
       MM_RECOVER  It is a recoverable error.
       MM_NRECOV   It is a nonrecoverable error.
   The severity argument
       The severity argument can take one of the following values:
       MM_NOSEV    No severity is printed.
       MM_HALT     This value is printed as HALT.
       MM_ERROR    This value is printed as ERROR.
       MM_WARNING  This value is printed as WARNING.
       MM_INFO     This value is printed as INFO.
       The numeric values are between 0 and 4.  Using addseverity(3) or the
       environment variable SEV_LEVEL you can add more levels and strings to
       print.
