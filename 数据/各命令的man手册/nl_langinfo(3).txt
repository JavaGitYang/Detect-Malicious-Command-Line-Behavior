       The nl_langinfo() and nl_langinfo_l() functions provide access to
       locale information in a more flexible way than localeconv(3).
       nl_langinfo() returns a string which is the value corresponding to
       item in the program's current global locale.  nl_langinfo() returns a
       string which is the value corresponding to item for the locale
       identified by the locale object locale, which was previously created
       by newlocale(1).  Individual and additional elements of the locale
       categories can be queried.
       Examples for the locale elements that can be specified in item using
       the constants defined in <langinfo.h> are:
       CODESET (LC_CTYPE)
              Return a string with the name of the character encoding used
              in the selected locale, such as "UTF-8", "ISO-8859-1", or
              "ANSI_X3.4-1968" (better known as US-ASCII).  This is the same
              string that you get with "locale charmap".  For a list of
              character encoding names, try "locale -m" (see locale(1)).
       D_T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string for
              strftime(3) to represent time and date in a locale-specific
              way.
       D_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string for
              strftime(3) to represent a date in a locale-specific way.
       T_FMT (LC_TIME)
              Return a string that can be used as a format string for
              strftime(3) to represent a time in a locale-specific way.
       DAY_{1–7} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th day of the week. [Warning: this
              follows the US convention DAY_1 = Sunday, not the
              international convention (ISO 8601) that Monday is the first
              day of the week.]
       ABDAY_{1–7} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th day of the week.
       MON_{1–12} (LC_TIME)
              Return name of the n-th month.
       ABMON_{1–12} (LC_TIME)
              Return abbreviated name of the n-th month.
       RADIXCHAR (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return radix character (decimal dot, decimal comma, etc.).
       THOUSEP (LC_NUMERIC)
              Return separator character for thousands (groups of three
              digits).
       YESEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return a regular expression that can be used with the regex(3)
              function to recognize a positive response to a yes/no
              question.
       NOEXPR (LC_MESSAGES)
              Return a regular expression that can be used with the regex(3)
              function to recognize a negative response to a yes/no
              question.
       CRNCYSTR (LC_MONETARY)
              Return the currency symbol, preceded by "-" if the symbol
              should appear before the value, "+" if the symbol should
              appear after the value, or "." if the symbol should replace
              the radix character.
       The above list covers just some examples of items that can be
       requested.  For a more detailed list, consult The GNU C Library
       Reference Manual.
