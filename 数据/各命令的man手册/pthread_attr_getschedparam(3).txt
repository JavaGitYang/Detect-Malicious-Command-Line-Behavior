       The pthread_attr_setschedparam() function sets the scheduling
       parameter attributes of the thread attributes object referred to by
       attr to the values specified in the buffer pointed to by param.
       These attributes determine the scheduling parameters of a thread
       created using the thread attributes object attr.
       The pthread_attr_getschedparam() returns the scheduling parameter
       attributes of the thread attributes object attr in the buffer pointed
       to by param.
       Scheduling parameters are maintained in the following structure:
           struct sched_param {
               int sched_priority;     /* Scheduling priority */
           };
       As can be seen, only one scheduling parameter is supported.  For
       details of the permitted ranges for scheduling priorities in each
       scheduling policy, see sched(7).
       In order for the parameter setting made by pthread_attr_setsched‚Äê
       param() to have effect when calling pthread_create(3), the caller
       must use pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) to set the inherit-scheduler
       attribute of the attributes object attr to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.
