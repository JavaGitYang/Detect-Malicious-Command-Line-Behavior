       Network namespaces provide isolation of the system resources
       associated with networking: network devices, IPv4 and IPv6 protocol
       stacks, IP routing tables, firewall rules, the /proc/net directory
       (which is a symbolic link to /proc/PID/net), the /sys/class/net
       directory, various files under /proc/sys/net, port numbers (sockets),
       and so on.  In addition, network namespaces isolate the UNIX domain
       abstract socket namespace (see unix(7)).
       A physical network device can live in exactly one network namespace.
       When a network namespace is freed (i.e., when the last process in the
       namespace terminates), its physical network devices are moved back to
       the initial network namespace (not to the parent of the process).
       A virtual network (veth(4)) device pair provides a pipe-like
       abstraction that can be used to create tunnels between network
       namespaces, and can be used to create a bridge to a physical network
       device in another namespace.  When a namespace is freed, the veth(4)
       devices that it contains are destroyed.
       Use of network namespaces requires a kernel that is configured with
       the CONFIG_NET_NS option.
