       dh_auto_test is a debhelper program that tries to automatically run a
       package's test suite. It does so by running the appropriate command
       for the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if
       there's a Makefile and it contains a test or check target, then this
       is done by running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is
       set). If the test suite fails, the command will exit nonzero. If
       there's no test suite, it will exit zero without doing anything.
       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages with a test suite.
       If it doesn't work, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_test at
       all, and just run the test suite manually.
