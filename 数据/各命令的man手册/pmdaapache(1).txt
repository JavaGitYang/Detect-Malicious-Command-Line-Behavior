       pmdaapache is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the state of an Apache web
       server.
       The apache PMDA exports metrics that measure the request rate,
       cumulative request sizes, uptime and various connection states for
       active clients.
       This information is obtained by performing a HTTP request to the
       server status URL, which must be enabled in the httpd.conf
       configuration file.
            ExtendedStatus on
            <Location /server-status>
            SetHandler server-status
            Order deny,allow
            Deny from all
            Allow from localhost
            </Location>
       A brief description of the pmdaapache command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            apache.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdaapache is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd .  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.
       -S   Query the Apache status information from the named server rather
            than the local host.
       -P   Query the Apache status information from the given port rather
            than the default (80).
       -L   Specify an alternative location for finding the server-status
            page.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
