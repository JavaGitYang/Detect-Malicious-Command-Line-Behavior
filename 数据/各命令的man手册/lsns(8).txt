       lsns lists information about all the currently accessible namespaces
       or about the given namespace.  The namespace identifier is an inode
       number.
       The default output is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you
       should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using the --output option
       together with a columns list in environments where a stable output is
       required.
       NSFS column, printed when net is specified for --type option, is
       special; it uses multi-line cells.  Use the option --nowrap is for
       switching to "," separated single-line representation.
       Note that lsns reads information directly from the /proc filesystem
       and for non-root users it may return incomplete information.  The
       current /proc filesystem may be unshared and affected by a PID
       namespace (see unshare --mount-proc for more details).  lsns is not
       able to see persistent namespaces without processes where the
       namespace instance is held by a bind mount to /proc/pid/ns/type.
