       Since GnuTLS 3.3.0 this function is no longer necessary to be
       explicitly called. To disable the implicit call (in a library
       constructor) of this function set the environment variable
       GNUTLS_NO_EXPLICIT_INIT to 1.
       This function performs any required precalculations, detects the
       supported CPU capabilities and initializes the underlying
       cryptographic backend. In order to free any resources taken by this
       call you should gnutls_global_deinit() when gnutls usage is no longer
       needed.
       This function increments a global counter, so that
       gnutls_global_deinit() only releases resources when it has been
       called as many times as gnutls_global_init().  This is useful when
       GnuTLS is used by more than one library in an application.  This
       function can be called many times, but will only do something the
       first time.
       A subsequent call of this function if the initial has failed will
       return the same error code.
