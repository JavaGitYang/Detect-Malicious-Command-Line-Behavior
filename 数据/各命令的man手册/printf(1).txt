       --version
              output version information and exit
       FORMAT controls the output as in C printf.  Interpreted sequences
       are:
       \"     double quote
       \\     backslash
       \a     alert (BEL)
       \b     backspace
       \c     produce no further output
       \e     escape
       \f     form feed
       \n     new line
       \r     carriage return
       \t     horizontal tab
       \v     vertical tab
       \NNN   byte with octal value NNN (1 to 3 digits)
       \xHH   byte with hexadecimal value HH (1 to 2 digits)
       \uHHHH Unicode (ISO/IEC 10646) character with hex value HHHH (4
              digits)
       \UHHHHHHHH
              Unicode character with hex value HHHHHHHH (8 digits)
       %%     a single %
       %b     ARGUMENT as a string with '\' escapes interpreted, except that
              octal escapes are of the form \0 or \0NNN
       %q     ARGUMENT is printed in a format that can be reused as shell
              input, escaping non-printable characters with the proposed
              POSIX $'' syntax.
       and all C format specifications ending with one of diouxXfeEgGcs,
       with ARGUMENTs converted to proper type first.  Variable widths are
       handled.
       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of printf, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's
       documentation for details about the options it supports.
