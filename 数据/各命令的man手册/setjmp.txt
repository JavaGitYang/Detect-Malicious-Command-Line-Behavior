       Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends
       the ISO C standard. Applications shall define the appropriate feature
       test macro (see the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section
       2.2, The Compilation Environment) to enable the visibility of these
       symbols in this header.
       The <setjmp.h> header shall define the array types jmp_buf and
       sigjmp_buf.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           void   _longjmp(jmp_buf, int);
           void   longjmp(jmp_buf, int);
           void   siglongjmp(sigjmp_buf, int);
       The following may be declared as functions, or defined as macros, or
       both. If functions are declared, function prototypes shall be
       provided.
           int    _setjmp(jmp_buf);
           int    setjmp(jmp_buf);
           int    sigsetjmp(sigjmp_buf, int);
       The following sections are informative.
