       One of the databases available with the Name Service Switch (NSS) is
       the aliases database, that contains mail aliases.  (To find out which
       databases are supported, try getent --help.)  Six functions are
       provided to access the aliases database.
       The getaliasent() function returns a pointer to a structure
       containing the group information from the aliases database.  The
       first time it is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it
       returns successive entries.
       The setaliasent() function rewinds the file pointer to the beginning
       of the aliases database.
       The endaliasent() function closes the aliases database.
       getaliasent_r() is the reentrant version of the previous function.
       The requested structure is stored via the first argument but the
       programmer needs to fill the other arguments also.  Not providing
       enough space causes the function to fail.
       The function getaliasbyname() takes the name argument and searches
       the aliases database.  The entry is returned as a pointer to a struct
       aliasent.
       getaliasbyname_r() is the reentrant version of the previous function.
       The requested structure is stored via the second argument but the
       programmer needs to fill the other arguments also.  Not providing
       enough space causes the function to fail.
       The struct aliasent is defined in <aliases.h>:
           struct aliasent {
               char    *alias_name;             /* alias name */
               size_t   alias_members_len;
               char   **alias_members;          /* alias name list */
               int      alias_local;
           };
