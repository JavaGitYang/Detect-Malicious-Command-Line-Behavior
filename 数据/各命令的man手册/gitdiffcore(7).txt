       The diff commands git diff-index, git diff-files, and git diff-tree
       can be told to manipulate differences they find in unconventional
       ways before showing diff output. The manipulation is collectively
       called "diffcore transformation". This short note describes what they
       are and how to use them to produce diff output that is easier to
       understand than the conventional kind.
