       Because the modprobe command can add or remove more than one module,
       due to modules having dependencies, we need a method of specifying
       what options are to be used with those modules. All files underneath
       the /etc/modprobe.d directory which end with the .conf extension
       specify those options as required. They can also be used to create
       convenient aliases: alternate names for a module, or they can
       override the normal modprobe behavior altogether for those with
       special requirements (such as inserting more than one module).
       Note that module and alias names (like other module names) can have -
       or _ in them: both are interchangeable throughout all the module
       commands as underscore conversion happens automatically.
       The format of and files under modprobe.d is simple: one command per
       line, with blank lines and lines starting with '#' ignored (useful
       for adding comments). A '\' at the end of a line causes it to
       continue on the next line, which makes the file a bit neater.
