       For towlower(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The towlower() and towlower_l() functions have as a domain a type
       wint_t, the value of which the application shall ensure is a
       character representable as a wchar_t, and a wide-character code
       corresponding to a valid character in the current locale or the value
       of WEOF.  If the argument has any other value, the behavior is
       undefined.  If the argument of towlower() or towlower_l() represents
       an uppercase wide-character code, and there exists a corresponding
       lowercase wide-character code as defined by character type
       information in the current locale or in the locale represented by
       locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE), the result shall be the
       corresponding lowercase wide-character code.  All other arguments in
       the domain are returned unchanged.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to towlower_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
