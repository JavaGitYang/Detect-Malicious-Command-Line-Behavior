           clock_t  tms_utime  User CPU time.
           clock_t  tms_stime  System CPU time.
           clock_t  tms_cutime User CPU time of terminated child processes.
           clock_t  tms_cstime System CPU time of terminated child processes.
       The <sys/times.h> header shall define the clock_t type as described
       in <sys/types.h>.
       The following shall be declared as a function and may also be defined
       as a macro. A function prototype shall be provided.
