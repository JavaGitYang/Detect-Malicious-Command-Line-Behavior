       The _longjmp() and _setjmp() functions shall be equivalent to
       longjmp() and setjmp(), respectively, with the additional restriction
       that _longjmp() and _setjmp() shall not manipulate the signal mask.
       If _longjmp() is called even though env was never initialized by a
       call to _setjmp(), or when the last such call was in a function that
       has since returned, the results are undefined.
