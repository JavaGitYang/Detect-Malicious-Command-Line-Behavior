       The border, wborder and box routines draw a box around the edges of a
       window.  Other than the window, each argument is a character with
       attributes:
              ls - left side,
              rs - right side,
              ts - top side,
              bs - bottom side,
              tl - top left-hand corner,
              tr - top right-hand corner,
              bl - bottom left-hand corner, and
              br - bottom right-hand corner.
       If any of these arguments is zero, then the corresponding default
       values (defined in curses.h) are used instead:
              ACS_VLINE,
              ACS_VLINE,
              ACS_HLINE,
              ACS_HLINE,
              ACS_ULCORNER,
              ACS_URCORNER,
              ACS_LLCORNER,
              ACS_LRCORNER.
       box(win, verch, horch) is a shorthand for the following call:
       wborder(win, verch, verch, horch, horch, 0, 0, 0, 0).
       The hline and whline functions draw a horizontal (left to right) line
       using ch starting at the current cursor position in the window.  The
       current cursor position is not changed.  The line is at most n
       characters long, or as many as fit into the window.
       The vline and wvline functions draw a vertical (top to bottom) line
       using ch starting at the current cursor position in the window.  The
       current cursor position is not changed.  The line is at most n
       characters long, or as many as fit into the window.
