       syscall() is a small library function that invokes the system call
       whose assembly language interface has the specified number with the
       specified arguments.  Employing syscall() is useful, for example,
       when invoking a system call that has no wrapper function in the C
       library.
       syscall() saves CPU registers before making the system call, restores
       the registers upon return from the system call, and stores any error
       code returned by the system call in errno(3) if an error occurs.
       Symbolic constants for system call numbers can be found in the header
       file <sys/syscall.h>.
