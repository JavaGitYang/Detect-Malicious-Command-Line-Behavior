       dh_shlibdeps is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       calculating shared library dependencies for packages.
       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-shlibdeps(1) that calls
       it once for each package listed in the control file, passing it a
       list of ELF executables and shared libraries it has found.
