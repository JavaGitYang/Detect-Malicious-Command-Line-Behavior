       The pam_acct_mgmt function is used to determine if the user's account
       is valid. It checks for authentication token and account expiration
       and verifies access restrictions. It is typically called after the
       user has been authenticated.
       The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
       more of the following values:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_DISALLOW_NULL_AUTHTOK
           The PAM module service should return PAM_NEW_AUTHTOK_REQD if the
           user has a null authentication token.
