       dh_install is a debhelper program that handles installing files into
       package build directories. There are many dh_install* commands that
       handle installing specific types of files such as documentation,
       examples, man pages, and so on, and they should be used when possible
       as they often have extra intelligence for those particular tasks.
       dh_install, then, is useful for installing everything else, for which
       no particular intelligence is needed. It is a replacement for the old
       dh_movefiles command.
       This program may be used in one of two ways. If you just have a file
       or two that the upstream Makefile does not install for you, you can
       run dh_install on them to move them into place. On the other hand,
       maybe you have a large package that builds multiple binary packages.
       You can use the upstream Makefile to install it all into debian/tmp,
       and then use dh_install to copy directories and files from there into
       the proper package build directories.
       From debhelper compatibility level 7 on, dh_install will fall back to
       looking in debian/tmp for files, if it doesn't find them in the
       current directory (or wherever you've told it to look using
       --sourcedir).
