       This function will "import" a PKCS 11 URL identifying an object (e.g.
       certificate) to the gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t type. This does not involve
       any parsing (such as X.509 or OpenPGP) since the gnutls_pkcs11_obj_t
       is format agnostic. Only data are transferred.
       If the flag GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_OVERWRITE_TRUSTMOD_EXT is
       specified any certificate read, will have its extensions overwritten
       by any stapled extensions in the trust module.
