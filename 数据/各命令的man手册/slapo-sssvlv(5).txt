       This overlay implements the LDAP Server Side Sorting (RFC2891)
       control as well as the Virtual List View control. It also replaces
       the default implementation of the LDAP PagedResults (RFC2696)
       control, to ensure that it works with Sorting. The overlay can be
       used with any backend or globally for all backends.
       Since a complete result set must be generated in memory before
       sorting can be performed, processing sort requests can have a large
       impact on the server's memory use. As such, any connection is limited
       to having only a limited number of sort requests active at a time.
       Additional limits may be configured as described below.
