       filecap is a program that prints out a report of programs with file
       based capabilities. If a file is not in the report or there is no
       report at all, no capabilities were found. For expedience, the
       default is to check only the directories in the PATH environmental
       variable. If the -a command line option is given, then all
       directories will be checked. If a directory is passed, it will
       recursively check that directory. If a path to a file is given, it
       will only check that file. If the path to the file includes
       capabilities, then they are written to the file.
