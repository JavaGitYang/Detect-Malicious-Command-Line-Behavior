       If p refers to a ``savefile'', pcap_major_version() returns the major
       number of the file format of the ``savefile'' and
       pcap_minor_version() returns the minor number of the file format of
       the ``savefile''.  The version number is stored in the ``savefile'';
       note that the meaning of its values depends on the type of
       ``savefile'' (for example, pcap or pcapng).
       If p refers to a live capture, the values returned by
       pcap_major_version() and pcap_minor_version() are not meaningful.
