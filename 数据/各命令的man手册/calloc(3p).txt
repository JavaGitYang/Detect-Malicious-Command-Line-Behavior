       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The calloc() function shall allocate unused space for an array of
       nelem elements each of whose size in bytes is elsize.  The space
       shall be initialized to all bits 0.
       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to
       calloc() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the allocation
       succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a
       pointer to any type of object and then used to access such an object
       or an array of such objects in the space allocated (until the space
       is explicitly freed or reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield
       a pointer to an object disjoint from any other object. The pointer
       returned shall point to the start (lowest byte address) of the
       allocated space. If the space cannot be allocated, a null pointer
       shall be returned. If the size of the space requested is 0, the
       behavior is implementation-defined: the value returned shall be
       either a null pointer or a unique pointer.
