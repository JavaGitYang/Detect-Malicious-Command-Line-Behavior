       The malloc_stats() function prints (on standard error) statistics
       about memory allocated by malloc(3) and related functions.  For each
       arena (allocation area), this function prints the total amount of
       memory allocated and the total number of bytes consumed by in-use
       allocations.  (These two values correspond to the arena and uordblks
       fields retrieved by mallinfo(3).)  In addition, the function prints
       the sum of these two statistics for all arenas, and the maximum
       number of blocks and bytes that were ever simultaneously allocated
       using mmap(2).
