       The pam_chauthtok function is used to change the authentication token
       for a given user (as indicated by the state associated with the
       handle pamh).
       The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The flags argument is the binary or of zero or
       more of the following values:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK
           This argument indicates to the modules that the user's
           authentication token (password) should only be changed if it has
           expired. If this argument is not passed, the application requires
           that all authentication tokens are to be changed.
