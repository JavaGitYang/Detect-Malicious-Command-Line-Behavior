       For wcsncpy(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcpncpy() and wcsncpy() functions shall copy not more than n
       wide-character codes (wide-character codes that follow a null wide-
       character code are not copied) from the array pointed to by ws2 to
       the array pointed to by ws1.  If copying takes place between objects
       that overlap, the behavior is undefined.
       If the array pointed to by ws2 is a wide-character string that is
       shorter than n wide-character codes, null wide-character codes shall
       be appended to the copy in the array pointed to by ws1, until n wide-
       character codes in all are written.
