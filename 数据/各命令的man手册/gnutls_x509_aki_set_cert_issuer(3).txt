       This function will set the authorityCertIssuer name and the
       authorityCertSerialNumber to be stored in the  aki type. When storing
       multiple names, the serial should be set on the first call, and
       subsequent calls should use a NULL serial.
       Since version 3.5.7 the GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME, GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME,
       and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP are converted to ACE format when
       necessary.
