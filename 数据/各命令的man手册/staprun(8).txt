       The staprun program is the back-end of the Systemtap tool.  It
       expects a kernel module produced by the front-end stap tool.
       Splitting the systemtap tool into a front-end and a back-end allows a
       user to compile a systemtap script on a development machine that has
       the kernel development tools (needed to compile the script) and then
       transfer the resulting kernel module to a production machine that
       doesn't have any development tools installed.
       Please refer to stappaths (7) for the version number, or run rpm -q
       systemtap (fedora/red hat) apt-get -v systemtap (ubuntu)
