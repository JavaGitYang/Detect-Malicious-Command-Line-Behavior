       The attributes of a batch job are altered by a request to the batch
       server that manages the batch job. The qalter utility is a user-
       accessible batch client that requests the alteration of the
       attributes of one or more batch jobs.
       The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of those batch jobs,
       and only those batch jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is
       presented to the utility.
       The qalter utility shall alter the attributes of batch jobs in the
       order in which the batch job_identifiers are presented to the
       utility.
       If the qalter utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       For each batch job_identifier for which the qalter utility succeeds,
       each attribute of the identified batch job shall be altered as
       indicated by all the options presented to the utility.
       For each identified batch job for which the qalter utility fails, the
       utility shall not alter any attribute of the batch job.
       For each batch job that the qalter utility processes, the utility
       shall not modify any attribute other than those required by the
       options and option-arguments presented to the utility.
       The qalter utility shall alter batch jobs by sending a Modify Job
       Request to the batch server that manages each batch job. At the time
       the qalter utility exits, it shall have modified the batch job
       corresponding to each successfully processed batch job_identifier.
       An attempt to alter the attributes of a batch job in the RUNNING
       state is implementation-defined.
