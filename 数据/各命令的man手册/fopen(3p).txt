       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fopen() function shall open the file whose pathname is the string
       pointed to by pathname, and associates a stream with it.
       The mode argument points to a string. If the string is one of the
       following, the file shall be opened in the indicated mode. Otherwise,
       the behavior is undefined.
       r or rb       Open file for reading.
       w or wb       Truncate to zero length or create file for writing.
       a or ab       Append; open or create file for writing at end-of-file.
       r+ or rb+ or r+b
                     Open file for update (reading and writing).
       w+ or wb+ or w+b
                     Truncate to zero length or create file for update.
       a+ or ab+ or a+b
                     Append; open or create file for update, writing at end-
                     of-file.
       The character 'b' shall have no effect, but is allowed for ISO C
       standard conformance.  Opening a file with read mode (r as the first
       character in the mode argument) shall fail if the file does not exist
       or cannot be read.
       Opening a file with append mode (a as the first character in the mode
       argument) shall cause all subsequent writes to the file to be forced
       to the then current end-of-file, regardless of intervening calls to
       fseek().
       When a file is opened with update mode ('+' as the second or third
       character in the mode argument), both input and output may be
       performed on the associated stream. However, the application shall
       ensure that output is not directly followed by input without an
       intervening call to fflush() or to a file positioning function
       (fseek(), fsetpos(), or rewind()), and input is not directly followed
       by output without an intervening call to a file positioning function,
       unless the input operation encounters end-of-file.
       When opened, a stream is fully buffered if and only if it can be
       determined not to refer to an interactive device. The error and end-
       of-file indicators for the stream shall be cleared.
       If mode is w, wb, a, ab, w+, wb+, w+b, a+, ab+, or a+b, and the file
       did not previously exist, upon successful completion, fopen() shall
       mark for update the last data access, last data modification, and
       last file status change timestamps of the file and the last file
       status change and last data modification timestamps of the parent
       directory.
       If mode is w, wb, a, ab, w+, wb+, w+b, a+, ab+, or a+b, and the file
       did not previously exist, the fopen() function shall create a file as
       if it called the creat() function with a value appropriate for the
       path argument interpreted from pathname and a value of S_IRUSR |
       S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH for the mode
       argument.
       If mode is w, wb, w+, wb+, or w+b, and the file did previously exist,
       upon successful completion, fopen() shall mark for update the last
       data modification and last file status change timestamps of the file.
       After a successful call to the fopen() function, the orientation of
       the stream shall be cleared, the encoding rule shall be cleared, and
       the associated mbstate_t object shall be set to describe an initial
       conversion state.
       The file descriptor associated with the opened stream shall be
       allocated and opened as if by a call to open() with the following
       flags:
                  ┌─────────────────┬───────────────────────────┐
