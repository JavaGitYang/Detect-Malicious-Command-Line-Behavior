       The alarm() function shall cause the system to generate a SIGALRM
       signal for the process after the number of realtime seconds specified
       by seconds have elapsed. Processor scheduling delays may prevent the
       process from handling the signal as soon as it is generated.
       If seconds is 0, a pending alarm request, if any, is canceled.
       Alarm requests are not stacked; only one SIGALRM generation can be
       scheduled in this manner. If the SIGALRM signal has not yet been
       generated, the call shall result in rescheduling the time at which
       the SIGALRM signal is generated.
       Interactions between alarm() and setitimer() are unspecified.
