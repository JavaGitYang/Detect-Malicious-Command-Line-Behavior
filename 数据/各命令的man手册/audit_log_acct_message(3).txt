       This function will log a message to the audit system using a
       predefined message format. It should be used for all account
       manipulation operations. The function parameters are as follows:

              type - type of message: AUDIT_USER_CHAUTHTOK for changing any

              op  -  operation. Ex: "adding-user", "changing-finger-info",
              "deleting-group". This value should have a dash or underscore
