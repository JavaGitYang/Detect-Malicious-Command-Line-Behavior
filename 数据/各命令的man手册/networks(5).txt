       The file /etc/networks is a plain ASCII file that describes known
       DARPA networks and symbolic names for these networks.  Each line
       represents a network and has the following structure:
              name number aliases ...
       where the fields are delimited by spaces or tabs.  Empty lines are
       ignored.  The hash character (#) indicates the start of a comment:
       this character, and the remaining characters up to the end of the
       current line, are ignored by library functions that process the file.
       The field descriptions are:
       name   The symbolic name for the network.  Network names can contain
              any printable characters except white-space characters or the
              comment character.
       number The official number for this network in numbers-and-dots
              notation (see inet(3)).  The trailing ".0" (for the host
              component of the network address) may be omitted.
       aliases
              Optional aliases for the network.
       This file is read by the route(8) and netstat(8) utilities.  Only
       Class A, B or C networks are supported, partitioned networks (i.e.,
       network/26 or network/28) are not supported by this facility.
