       xfs_mdrestore is a debugging tool that restores a metadata image
       generated by xfs_metadump(8) to a filesystem. The source argument
       specifies the location of the metadump image and the target argument
       specifies the destination for the filesystem image.  If the source is
       -, then the metadata image is read from stdin. This allows the output
       of be another program such as a compression application to be
       redirected to xfs_mdrestore.  The target can be either a file or a
       device.
       xfs_mdrestore should not be used to restore metadata onto an existing
       filesystem unless you are completely certain the target can be
       destroyed.
