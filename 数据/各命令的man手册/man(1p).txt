       The man utility shall write information about each of the name
       operands. If name is the name of a standard utility, man at a minimum
       shall write a message describing the syntax used by the standard
       utility, its options, and operands. If more information is available,
       the man utility shall provide it in an implementation-defined manner.
       An implementation may provide information for values of name other
       than the standard utilities. Standard utilities that are listed as
       optional and that are not supported by the implementation either
       shall cause a brief message indicating that fact to be displayed or
       shall cause a full display of information as described previously.
