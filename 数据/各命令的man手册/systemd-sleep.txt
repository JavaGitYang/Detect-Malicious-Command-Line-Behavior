       systemd supports three general power-saving modes:
       suspend
           a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and
           complete power loss might result in lost data, and which is fast
           to enter and exit. This corresponds to suspend, standby, or
           freeze states as understood by the kernel.
       hibernate
           a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, and
           complete power loss does not result in lost data, and which might
           be slow to enter and exit. This corresponds to the hibernation as
           understood by the kernel.
       hybrid-sleep
           a low-power state where execution of the OS is paused, which
           might be slow to enter, and on complete power loss does not
           result in lost data but might be slower to exit in that case.
           This mode is called suspend-to-both by the kernel.
       Settings in these files determine what strings will be written to
       /sys/power/disk and /sys/power/state by systemd-sleep(8) when
       systemd(1) attempts to suspend or hibernate the machine.
