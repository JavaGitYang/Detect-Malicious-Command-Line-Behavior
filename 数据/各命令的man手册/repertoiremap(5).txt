       A repertoire map defines mappings between symbolic character names
       (mnemonics) and Unicode code points when compiling a locale with
       localedef(1).  Using a repertoire map is optional, it is needed only
       when symbolic names are used instead of now preferred Unicode code
       points.
   Syntax
       The repertoiremap file starts with a header that may consist of the
       following keywords:
       comment_char
              is followed by a character that will be used as the comment
              character for the rest of the file.  It defaults to the number
              sign (#).
       escape_char
              is followed by a character that should be used as the escape
              character for the rest of the file to mark characters that
              should be interpreted in a special way.  It defaults to the
              backslash (\).
       The mapping section starts with the keyword CHARIDS in the first
       column.
       The mapping lines have the following form:
       <symbolic-name> <code-point> comment
              This defines exactly one mapping, comment being optional.
       The mapping section ends with the string END CHARIDS.
