       selinux_colors_path() returns the path to the active policy color
       configuration file.
       The path is built from the path returned by selinux_policy_root(3)
       with /secolor.conf appended.
       This optional configuration file whose format is shown in
       secolor.conf(5), controls the colors to be associated with the raw
       context components of the selinux_raw_context_to_color(3) function
       when information is to be displayed by an SELinux color-aware
       application.
