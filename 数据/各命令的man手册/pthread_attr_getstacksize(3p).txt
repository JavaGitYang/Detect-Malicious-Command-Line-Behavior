       The pthread_attr_getstacksize() and pthread_attr_setstacksize()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the thread creation
       stacksize attribute in the attr object.
       The stacksize attribute shall define the minimum stack size (in
       bytes) allocated for the created threads stack.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getstacksize() or pthread_attr_setstacksize() does
       not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
