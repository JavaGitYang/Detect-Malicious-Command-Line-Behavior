       This function sets the seed that is used to generate salts for
       invalid (non-existent) usernames.
       In order to prevent attackers from guessing valid usernames, when a
       user does not exist gnutls generates a salt and a verifier and
       proceeds with the protocol as usual.  The authentication will
       ultimately fail, but the client cannot tell whether the username is
       valid (exists) or invalid.
       If an attacker learns the seed, given a salt (which is part of the
       handshake) which was generated when the seed was in use, it can tell
       whether or not the authentication failed because of an unknown
       username.  This seed cannot be used to reveal application data or
       passwords.
        salt_length should represent the salt length your application uses.
       Generating fake salts longer than 20 bytes is not supported.
       By default the seed is a random value, different each time a
       gnutls_srp_server_credentials_t is allocated and fake salts are 16
       bytes long.
