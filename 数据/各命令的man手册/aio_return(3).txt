       The aio_return() function returns the final return status for the
       asynchronous I/O request with control block pointed to by aiocbp.
       (See aio(7) for a description of the aiocb structure.)
       This function should be called only once for any given request, after
       aio_error(3) returns something other than EINPROGRESS.
