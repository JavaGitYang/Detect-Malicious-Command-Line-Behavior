       The mq_close() function shall remove the association between the
       message queue descriptor, mqdes, and its message queue. The results
       of using this message queue descriptor after successful return from
       this mq_close(), and until the return of this message queue
       descriptor from a subsequent mq_open(), are undefined.
       If the process has successfully attached a notification request to
       the message queue via this mqdes, this attachment shall be removed,
       and the message queue is available for another process to attach for
       notification.
