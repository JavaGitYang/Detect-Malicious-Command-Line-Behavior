       This is a helper function to generate the keying material for SRTP.
       It requires the space of the key material to be pre-allocated (should
       be at least 2x the maximum key size and salt size). The  client_key ,
       client_salt ,  server_key and  server_salt are convenience datums
       that point inside the key material. They may be NULL.
