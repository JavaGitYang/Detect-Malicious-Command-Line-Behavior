       Export a range of applied patches to a given directory (defaults to
       patches-<branch>) in a standard unified GNU diff format. A template
       file (defaulting to .git/patchexport.tmpl or
       ~/.stgit/templates/patchexport.tmpl or
       /usr/share/stgit/templates/patchexport.tmpl) can be used for the
       patch format. The following variables are supported in the template
       file:
           %(description)s - patch description
           %(shortdescr)s  - the first line of the patch description
           %(longdescr)s   - the rest of the patch description, after the first line
           %(diffstat)s    - the diff statistics
           %(authname)s    - author's name
           %(authemail)s   - author's e-mail
           %(authdate)s    - patch creation date
           %(commname)s    - committer's name
           %(commemail)s   - committer's e-mail
