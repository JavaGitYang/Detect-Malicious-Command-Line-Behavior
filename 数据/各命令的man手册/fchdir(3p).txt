       The fchdir() function shall be equivalent to chdir() except that the
       directory that is to be the new current working directory is
       specified by the file descriptor fildes.
       A conforming application can obtain a file descriptor for a file of
       type directory using open(), provided that the file status flags and
       access modes do not contain O_WRONLY or O_RDWR.
