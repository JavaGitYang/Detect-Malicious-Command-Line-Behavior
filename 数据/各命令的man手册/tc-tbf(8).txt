       The Token Bucket Filter is a classful queueing discipline available
       for traffic control with the tc(8) command.
       TBF is a pure shaper and never schedules traffic. It is non-work-
       conserving and may throttle itself, although packets are available,
       to ensure that the configured rate is not exceeded.  It is able to
       shape up to 1mbit/s of normal traffic with ideal minimal burstiness,
       sending out data exactly at the configured rates.
       Much higher rates are possible but at the cost of losing the minimal
       burstiness. In that case, data is on average dequeued at the
       configured rate but may be sent much faster at millisecond
       timescales. Because of further queues living in network adaptors,
       this is often not a problem.
