       dh_auto_install is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       install built files. It does so by running the appropriate command
       for the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if
       there's a Makefile and it contains a install target, then this is
       done by running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is set).
       If there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it is used. Note that the Ant
       build system does not support installation, so dh_auto_install will
       not install files built using Ant.
       Unless --destdir option is specified, the files are installed into
       debian/package/ if there is only one binary package. In the multiple
       binary package case, the files are instead installed into
       debian/tmp/, and should be moved from there to the appropriate
       package build directory using dh_install(1).
       DESTDIR is used to tell make where to install the files.  If the
       Makefile was generated by MakeMaker from a Makefile.PL, it will
       automatically set PREFIX=/usr too, since such Makefiles need that.
       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, or tries to use the wrong install target, you're encouraged to
       skip using dh_auto_install at all, and just run make install
       manually.
