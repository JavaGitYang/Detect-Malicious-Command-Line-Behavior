       yum includes an interactive shell for conducting multiple commands or
       sets of commands during a single execution of yum. These commands can
       be issued manually or passed to yum from a file. The commands are
       much the same as the normal yum command line options. See here yum(8)
       for that information. There are a few additional commands documented
       below.
       config
                 [argument] [value]
                 args: debuglevel, errorlevel, obsoletes, gpgcheck,
              assumeyes, exclude
                   If no value is given it prints the current value.
                   If value is given it sets that value.
       repo
                 [argument] [option]
                   list: lists repositories and their status
                   enable: enable repositories. option = repository id
                   disable: disable repositories. option = repository id
       transaction
                 [argument]
                   list: lists the contents of the transaction
                   reset: reset (zero-out) the transaction
                   solve: run the dependency solver on the transaction
                   run: run the transaction
       exit
                   Causes the shell to exit, setting the exit status as
              specified by the
                   shell_exit_status option in yum.conf(5).
                   This command is also triggered when EOF is read (usually
              the C-d keystroke
                   or end of script).
