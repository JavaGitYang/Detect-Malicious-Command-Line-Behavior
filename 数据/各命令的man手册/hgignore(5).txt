       The working directory of a Mercurial repository will often contain
       files that should not be tracked by Mercurial. These include backup
       files created by editors and build products created by compilers.
       These files can be ignored by listing them in a .hgignore file in the
       root of the working directory. The .hgignore file must be created
       manually. It is typically put under version control, so that the
       settings will propagate to other repositories with push and pull.
       An untracked file is ignored if its path relative to the repository
       root directory, or any prefix path of that path, is matched against
       any pattern in .hgignore.
       For example, say we have an untracked file, file.c, at a/b/file.c
       inside our repository. Mercurial will ignore file.c if any pattern in
       .hgignore matches a/b/file.c, a/b or a.
       In addition, a Mercurial configuration file can reference a set of
       per-user or global ignore files. See the ignore configuration key on
       the [ui] section of hg help config for details of how to configure
       these files.
       To control Mercurial's handling of files that it manages, many
       commands support the -I and -X options; see hg help <command> and hg
       help patterns for details.
       Files that are already tracked are not affected by .hgignore, even if
       they appear in .hgignore. An untracked file X can be explicitly added
       with hg add X, even if X would be excluded by a pattern in .hgignore.
