       The <utmpx.h> header shall define the utmpx structure that shall
       include at least the following members:
           char            ut_user[]  User login name.
           char            ut_id[]    Unspecified initialization process identifier.
           char            ut_line[]  Device name.
           pid_t           ut_pid     Process ID.
           short           ut_type    Type of entry.
           struct timeval  ut_tv      Time entry was made.
       The <utmpx.h> header shall define the pid_t type through typedef, as
       described in <sys/types.h>.
       The <utmpx.h> header shall define the timeval structure as described
       in <sys/time.h>.
       Inclusion of the <utmpx.h> header may also make visible all symbols
       from <sys/time.h>.
       The <utmpx.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants as
       possible values for the ut_type member of the utmpx structure:
       EMPTY         No valid user accounting information.
       BOOT_TIME     Identifies time of system boot.
       OLD_TIME      Identifies time when system clock changed.
       NEW_TIME      Identifies time after system clock changed.
       USER_PROCESS  Identifies a process.
       INIT_PROCESS  Identifies a process spawned by the init process.
       LOGIN_PROCESS Identifies the session leader of a logged-in user.
       DEAD_PROCESS  Identifies a session leader who has exited.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           void          endutxent(void);
           struct utmpx *getutxent(void);
           struct utmpx *getutxid(const struct utmpx *);
           struct utmpx *getutxline(const struct utmpx *);
           struct utmpx *pututxline(const struct utmpx *);
           void          setutxent(void);
