       windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into an
       output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:
       "rc"
           A text format read by the Resource Compiler.
       "res"
           A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.
       "coff"
           A COFF object or executable.
       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.
       When windres converts from the "rc" format to the "res" format, it is
       acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When windres converts
       from the "res" format to the "coff" format, it is acting like the
       Windows "CVTRES" program.
       When windres generates an "rc" file, the output is similar but not
       identical to the format expected for the input.  When an input "rc"
       file refers to an external filename, an output "rc" file will instead
       include the file contents.
       If the input or output format is not specified, windres will guess
       based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file contents.  A
       file with an extension of .rc will be treated as an "rc" file, a file
       with an extension of .res will be treated as a "res" file, and a file
       with an extension of .o or .exe will be treated as a "coff" file.
       If no output file is specified, windres will print the resources in
       "rc" format to standard output.
       The normal use is for you to write an "rc" file, use windres to
       convert it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file into
       your application.  This will make the resources described in the "rc"
       file available to Windows.
