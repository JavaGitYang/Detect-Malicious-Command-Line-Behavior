       The posix_trace_get_attr() function shall copy the attributes of the
       active trace stream identified by trid into the object pointed to by
       the attr argument.  If the Trace Log option is supported, trid may
       represent a pre-recorded trace log.
       The posix_trace_get_status() function shall return, in the structure
       pointed to by the statusinfo argument, the current trace status for
       the trace stream identified by the trid argument. These status values
       returned in the structure pointed to by statusinfo shall have been
       appropriately read to ensure that the returned values are consistent.
       If the Trace Log option is supported and the trid argument refers to
       a pre-recorded trace stream, the status shall be the status of the
       completed trace stream.
       Each time the posix_trace_get_status() function is used, the overrun
       status of the trace stream shall be reset to POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN
       immediately after the call completes.  If the Trace Log option is
       supported, the posix_trace_get_status() function shall behave the
       same as when the option is not supported except for the following
       differences:
        *  If the trid argument refers to a trace stream with log, each time
           the posix_trace_get_status() function is used, the log overrun
           status of the trace stream shall be reset to
           POSIX_TRACE_NO_OVERRUN and the flush_error status shall be reset
           to zero immediately after the call completes.
        *  If the trid argument refers to a pre-recorded trace stream, the
           status returned shall be the status of the completed trace stream
           and the status values of the trace stream shall not be reset.
