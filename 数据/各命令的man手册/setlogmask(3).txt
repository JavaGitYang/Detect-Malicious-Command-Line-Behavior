       A process has a log priority mask that determines which calls to
       syslog(3) may be logged.  All other calls will be ignored.  Logging
       is enabled for the priorities that have the corresponding bit set in
       mask.  The initial mask is such that logging is enabled for all
       priorities.
       The setlogmask() function sets this logmask for the calling process,
       and returns the previous mask.  If the mask argument is 0, the
       current logmask is not modified.
       The eight priorities are LOG_EMERG, LOG_ALERT, LOG_CRIT, LOG_ERR,
       LOG_WARNING, LOG_NOTICE, LOG_INFO, and LOG_DEBUG.  The bit
       corresponding to a priority p is LOG_MASK(p).  Some systems also
       provide a macro LOG_UPTO(p) for the mask of all priorities in the
       above list up to and including p.
