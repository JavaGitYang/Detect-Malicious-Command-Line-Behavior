       systemd-timedated is a system service that may be used as a mechanism
       to change the system clock and timezone, as well as to enable/disable
       NTP time synchronization.  systemd-timedated is automatically
       activated on request and terminates itself when it is unused.
       The tool timedatectl(1) is a command line client to this service.
       See the developer documentation[1] for information about the APIs
