       The ppolicy overlay is an implementation of the most recent IETF
       Password Policy proposal for LDAP.   When instantiated, it
       intercepts, decodes and applies specific password policy controls to
       overall use of a backend database, changes to user password fields,
       etc.
       The overlay provides a variety of password control mechanisms.  They
       include password aging -- both minimum and maximum ages, password
       reuse and duplication control, account time-outs, mandatory password
       resets, acceptable password content, and even grace logins.
       Different groups of users may be associated with different password
       policies, and there is no limit to the number of password policies
       that may be created.
       Note that some of the policies do not take effect when the operation
       is performed with the rootdn identity; all the operations, when
       performed with any other identity, may be subjected to constraints,
       like access control.  This overlay requires a rootdn to be configured
       on the database.
       Note that the IETF Password Policy proposal for LDAP makes sense when
       considering a single-valued password attribute, while the
       userPassword attribute allows multiple values.  This implementation
       enforces a single value for the userPassword attribute, despite its
       specification.
