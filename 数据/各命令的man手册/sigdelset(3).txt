       These functions allow the manipulation of POSIX signal sets.
       sigemptyset() initializes the signal set given by set to empty, with
       all signals excluded from the set.
       sigfillset() initializes set to full, including all signals.
       sigaddset() and sigdelset() add and delete respectively signal signum
       from set.
       sigismember() tests whether signum is a member of set.
       Objects of type sigset_t must be initialized by a call to either
       sigemptyset() or sigfillset() before being passed to the functions
       sigaddset(), sigdelset() and sigismember() or the additional glibc
       functions described below (sigisemptyset(), sigandset(), and
       sigorset()).  The results are undefined if this is not done.
