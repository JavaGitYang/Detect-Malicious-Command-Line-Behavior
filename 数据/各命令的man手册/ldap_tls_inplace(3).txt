       These routines are used to initiate TLS processing on an LDAP
       session.  ldap_start_tls_s() sends a StartTLS request to a server,
       waits for the reply, and then installs TLS handlers on the session if
       the request succeeded. The routine returns LDAP_SUCCESS if everything
       succeeded, otherwise it returns an LDAP error code.  ldap_start_tls()
       sends a StartTLS request to a server and does nothing else. It
       returns LDAP_SUCCESS if the request was sent successfully.
       ldap_tls_inplace() returns 1 if TLS handlers have been installed on
       the specified session, 0 otherwise.  ldap_install_tls() installs the
       TLS handlers on the given session. It returns LDAP_LOCAL_ERROR if TLS
       is already installed.
