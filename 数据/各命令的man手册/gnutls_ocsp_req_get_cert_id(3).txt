       This function will return the certificate information of the
        indx 'ed request in the OCSP request.  The information returned
       corresponds to the CertID structure:
       <informalexample><programlisting> CertID      ::=     SEQUENCE {
       hashAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier, issuerNameHash      OCTET
       STRING, -- Hash of Issuer's DN issuerKeyHash       OCTET STRING, --
       Hash of Issuers public key serialNumber   CertificateSerialNumber }
       </programlisting></informalexample>
       Each of the pointers to output variables may be NULL to indicate that
       the caller is not interested in that value.
