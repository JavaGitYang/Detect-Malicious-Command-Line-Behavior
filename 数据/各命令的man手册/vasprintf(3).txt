       The functions asprintf() and vasprintf() are analogs of sprintf(3)
       and vsprintf(3), except that they allocate a string large enough to
       hold the output including the terminating null byte ('\0'), and
       return a pointer to it via the first argument.  This pointer should
       be passed to free(3) to release the allocated storage when it is no
       longer needed.
