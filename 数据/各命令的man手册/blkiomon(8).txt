       blkiomon is a block device I/O monitor. It periodically generates
       per-device request size and request latency statistics from blktrace
       data. It provides histograms as well as data that can be used to
       calculate min, max, average and variance. For this purpose, it
       consumes D and C traces read from stdin.  Note, that this doesn't
       work for logical volumes, as high-level drivers don't see the
       completion of the events (C).
       There are options for binary output and human-readable output to
       files and stdout. Output to a message queue is supported as well.
       There is no need to use blkparse with blkiomon. blkiomon is capable
       of consuming binary output written to stdout by blktrace.
