       The yacc utility shall read a description of a context-free grammar
       in grammar and write C source code, conforming to the ISO C standard,
       to a code file, and optionally header information into a header file,
       in the current directory. The generated source code shall not depend
       on any undefined, unspecified, or implementation-defined behavior,
       except in cases where it is copied directly from the supplied
       grammar, or in cases that are documented by the implementation. The C
       code shall define a function and related routines and macros for an
       automaton that executes a parsing algorithm meeting the requirements
       in Algorithms.
       The form and meaning of the grammar are described in the EXTENDED
       DESCRIPTION section.
       The C source code and header file shall be produced in a form
       suitable as input for the C compiler (see c99(1p)).
