       systemd-getty-generator is a generator that automatically
       instantiates serial-getty@.service on the kernel console /dev/console
       if that is not directed to the virtual console subsystem. It will
       also instantiate serial-getty@.service instances for virtualizer
       consoles, if execution in a virtualized environment is detected.
       Finally, it will instantiate container-getty@.service instances for
       additional container pseudo TTYs as requested by the container
       manager (see Container Interface[1]). This should ensure that the
       user is shown a login prompt at the right place, regardless of which
       environment the system is started in. For example, it is sufficient
       to redirect the kernel console with a kernel command line argument
       such as console= to get both kernel messages and a getty prompt on a
       serial TTY. See kernel-parameters.txt[2] for more information on the
       console= kernel parameter.
       systemd-getty-generator implements systemd.generator(7).
       Further information about configuration of gettys you may find in
       systemd for Administrators, Part XVI: Gettys on Serial Consoles (and
       Elsewhere)[3].
