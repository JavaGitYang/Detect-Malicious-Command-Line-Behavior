       umask() sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to
       mask & 0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of mask are used),
       and returns the previous value of the mask.
       The umask is used by open(2), mkdir(2), and other system calls that
       create files to modify the permissions placed on newly created files
       or directories.  Specifically, permissions in the umask are turned
       off from the mode argument to open(2) and mkdir(2).
       Alternatively, if the parent directory has a default ACL (see
       acl(5)), the umask is ignored, the default ACL is inherited, the
       permission bits are set based on the inherited ACL, and permission
       bits absent in the mode argument are turned off.  For example, the
       following default ACL is equivalent to a umask of 022:
           u::rwx,g::r-x,o::r-x
       Combining the effect of this default ACL with a mode argument of 0666
       (rw-rw-rw-), the resulting file permissions would be 0644 (rw-
       r--r--).
       The constants that should be used to specify mask are described in
       inode(7).
       The typical default value for the process umask is S_IWGRP | S_IWOTH
       (octal 022).  In the usual case where the mode argument to open(2) is
       specified as:
           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IWGRP | S_IROTH | S_IWOTH
       (octal 0666) when creating a new file, the permissions on the result‚Äê
       ing file will be:
           S_IRUSR | S_IWUSR | S_IRGRP | S_IROTH
       (because 0666 & ~022 = 0644; i.e., rw-r--r--).
