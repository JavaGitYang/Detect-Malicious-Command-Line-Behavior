       This function will return the bits of the prime used in the last
       Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the peer.  Should be used for both
       anonymous and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  Note that some ciphers, like
       RSA and DSA without DHE, do not use a Diffie-Hellman key exchange,
       and then this function will return 0.
