       The trace-cmd(1) stack enables the Ftrace stack tracer within the
       kernel. The stack tracer enables the function tracer and at each
       function call within the kernel, the stack is checked. When a new
       maximum usage stack is discovered, it is recorded.
       When no option is used, the current stack is displayed.
       To enable the stack tracer, use the option --start, and to disable
       the stack tracer, use the option --stop. The output will be the
       maximum stack found since the start was enabled.
       Use --reset to reset the stack counter to zero.
