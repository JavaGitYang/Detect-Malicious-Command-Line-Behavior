       localectl may be used to query and change the system locale and
       keyboard layout settings. It communicates with systemd-localed(8) to
       modify files such as /etc/locale.conf and /etc/vconsole.conf.
       The system locale controls the language settings of system services
       and of the UI before the user logs in, such as the display manager,
       as well as the default for users after login.
       The keyboard settings control the keyboard layout used on the text
       console and of the graphical UI before the user logs in, such as the
       display manager, as well as the default for users after login.
       Note that the changes performed using this tool might require the
       initramfs to be rebuilt to take effect during early system boot. The
       initramfs is not rebuilt automatically by localectl.
       Note that systemd-firstboot(1) may be used to initialize the system
       locale for mounted (but not booted) system images.
