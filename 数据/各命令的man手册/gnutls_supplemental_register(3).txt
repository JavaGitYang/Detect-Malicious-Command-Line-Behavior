       This function will register a new supplemental data type (rfc4680).
       The registered data will remain until gnutls_global_deinit() is
       called. The provided  type must be an unassigned type in
       gnutls_supplemental_data_format_type_t. If the type is already
       registered or handled by GnuTLS internally
       GNUTLS_E_ALREADY_REGISTERED will be returned.
       This function is not thread safe.
