     The acl_check() function checks the ACL referred to by the argument acl
     for validity.
     The three required entries ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER
     must exist exactly once in the ACL. If the ACL contains any ACL_USER or
     ACL_GROUP entries, then an ACL_MASK entry is also required. The ACL may
     contain at most one ACL_MASK entry.
     The user identifiers must be unique among all entries of type ACL_USER.
     The group identifiers must be unique among all entries of type
     ACL_GROUP.
     If the ACL referred to by acl is invalid, acl_check() returns a posi‚Äê
     tive error code that indicates which type of error was detected.  The
     following symbolic error codes are defined:
     ACL_MULTI_ERROR       The ACL contains multiple entries that have a tag
                           type that may occur at most once.
     ACL_DUPLICATE_ERROR   The ACL contains multiple ACL_USER entries with
                           the same user ID, or multiple ACL_GROUP entries
                           with the same group ID.
     ACL_MISS_ERROR        A required entry is missing.
     ACL_ENTRY_ERROR       The ACL contains an invalid entry tag type.
     The acl_error() function can be used to translate error codes to text
     messages.
     In addition, if the pointer last is not NULL, acl_check() assigns the
     number of the ACL entry at which the error was detected to the value
     pointed to by last.  Entries are numbered starting with zero, in the
     order in which they would be returned by the acl_get_entry() function.
