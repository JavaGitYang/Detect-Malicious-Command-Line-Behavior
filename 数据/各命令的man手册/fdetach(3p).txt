       The fdetach() function shall detach a STREAMS-based file from the
       file to which it was attached by a previous call to fattach().  The
       path argument points to the pathname of the attached STREAMS file.
       The process shall have appropriate privileges or be the owner of the
       file.  A successful call to fdetach() shall cause all pathnames that
       named the attached STREAMS file to again name the file to which the
       STREAMS file was attached. All subsequent operations on path shall
       operate on the underlying file and not on the STREAMS file.
       All open file descriptions established while the STREAMS file was
       attached to the file referenced by path shall still refer to the
       STREAMS file after the fdetach() has taken effect.
       If there are no open file descriptors or other references to the
       STREAMS file, then a successful call to fdetach() shall be equivalent
       to performing the last close() on the attached file.
