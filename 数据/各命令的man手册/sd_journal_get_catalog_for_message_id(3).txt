       sd_journal_get_catalog() retrieves a message catalog entry for the
       current journal entry. This will look up an entry in the message
       catalog by using the "MESSAGE_ID=" field of the current journal
       entry. Before returning the entry all journal field names in the
       catalog entry text enclosed in "@" will be replaced by the respective
       field values of the current entry. If a field name referenced in the
       message catalog entry does not exist, in the current journal entry,
       the "@" will be removed, but the field name otherwise left untouched.
       sd_journal_get_catalog_for_message_id() works similar to
       sd_journal_get_catalog() but the entry is looked up by the specified
       message ID (no open journal context is necessary for this), and no
       field substitution is performed.
       For more information about the journal message catalog please refer
       to the Journal Message Catalogs[1] documentation page.
