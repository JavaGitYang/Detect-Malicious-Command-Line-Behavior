       systemd-machined is a system service that keeps track of virtual
       machines and containers, and processes belonging to them.
       See systemd-nspawn(1) for some examples on how to run containers with
       OS tools.
       Use nss-mymachines(8) to make the names of local containers known to
       systemd-machined locally resolvable as host names.
       See the machined D-Bus API Documentation[1] for information about the
       APIs systemd-machined provides.
