       lvmpolld is polling daemon for LVM. The daemon receives requests for
       polling of already initialised operations originating in LVM2 command
       line tool.  The requests for polling originate in the lvconvert,
       pvmove, lvchange or vgchange LVM2 commands.
       The purpose of lvmpolld is to reduce the number of spawned background
       processes per otherwise unique polling operation. There should be
       only one. It also eliminates the possibility of unsolicited
       termination of background process by external factors.
       lvmpolld is used by LVM only if it is enabled in lvm.conf(5) by
       specifying the global/use_lvmpolld setting. If this is not defined in
       the LVM configuration explicitly then default setting is used instead
       (see the output of lvmconfig --type default global/use_lvmpolld
       command).
