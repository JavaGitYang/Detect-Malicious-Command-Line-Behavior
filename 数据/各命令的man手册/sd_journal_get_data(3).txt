       sd_journal_get_data() gets the data object associated with a specific
       field from the current journal entry. It takes four arguments: the
       journal context object, a string with the field name to request, plus
       a pair of pointers to pointer/size variables where the data object
       and its size shall be stored in. The field name should be an entry
       field name. Well-known field names are listed in
       systemd.journal-fields(7). The returned data is in a read-only memory
       map and is only valid until the next invocation of
       sd_journal_get_data() or sd_journal_enumerate_data(), or the read
       pointer is altered. Note that the data returned will be prefixed with
       the field name and '='. Also note that, by default, data fields
       larger than 64K might get truncated to 64K. This threshold may be
       changed and turned off with sd_journal_set_data_threshold() (see
       below).
       sd_journal_enumerate_data() may be used to iterate through all fields
       of the current entry. On each invocation the data for the next field
       is returned. The order of these fields is not defined. The data
       returned is in the same format as with sd_journal_get_data() and also
       follows the same life-time semantics.
       sd_journal_restart_data() resets the data enumeration index to the
       beginning of the entry. The next invocation of
       sd_journal_enumerate_data() will return the first field of the entry
       again.
       Note that the SD_JOURNAL_FOREACH_DATA() macro may be used as a handy
       wrapper around sd_journal_restart_data() and
       sd_journal_enumerate_data().
       Note that these functions will not work before sd_journal_next(3) (or
       related call) has been called at least once, in order to position the
       read pointer at a valid entry.
       sd_journal_set_data_threshold() may be used to change the data field
       size threshold for data returned by sd_journal_get_data(),
       sd_journal_enumerate_data() and sd_journal_enumerate_unique(). This
       threshold is a hint only: it indicates that the client program is
       interested only in the initial parts of the data fields, up to the
       threshold in size â€” but the library might still return larger data
       objects. That means applications should not rely exclusively on this
       setting to limit the size of the data fields returned, but need to
       apply an explicit size limit on the returned data as well. This
       threshold defaults to 64K by default. To retrieve the complete data
       fields this threshold should be turned off by setting it to 0, so
       that the library always returns the complete data objects. It is
       recommended to set this threshold as low as possible since this
       relieves the library from having to decompress large compressed data
       objects in full.
       sd_journal_get_data_threshold() returns the currently configured data
       field size threshold.
