       dh_prep is a debhelper program that performs some file cleanups in
       preparation for building a binary package. (This is what dh_clean -k
       used to do.) It removes the package build directories, debian/tmp,
       and some temp files that are generated when building a binary
       package.
       It is typically run at the top of the binary-arch and binary-indep
       targets, or at the top of a target such as install that they depend
       on.
