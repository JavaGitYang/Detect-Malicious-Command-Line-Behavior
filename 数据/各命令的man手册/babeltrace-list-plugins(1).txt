       The list-plugins command prints a list of available Babeltrace
       plugins along with their component classes and their properties.
       See babeltrace-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace project
       and its core concepts.
   Plugin path
       This command loads Babeltrace plugins to perform its operation. The
       search path for Babeltrace plugins is, in this order:
        1. The colon-separated list of directories in the
           BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH environment variable.
        2. The colon-separated list of directories in the --plugin-path
           option.
        3. If the --omit-home-plugin-path option is absent:
           $HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
        4. If the --omit-system-plugin-path option is absent:
           /usr/local/lib/babeltrace/plugins
       You can use the babeltrace-list-plugins(1) command to dynamically
       list the available plugins.
