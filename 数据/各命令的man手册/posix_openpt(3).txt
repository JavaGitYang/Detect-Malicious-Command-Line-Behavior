       The posix_openpt() function opens an unused pseudoterminal master
       device, returning a file descriptor that can be used to refer to that
       device.
       The flags argument is a bit mask that ORs together zero or more of
       the following flags:
       O_RDWR Open the device for both reading and writing.  It is usual to
              specify this flag.
       O_NOCTTY
              Do not make this device the controlling terminal for the
              process.
