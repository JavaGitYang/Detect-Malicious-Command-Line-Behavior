       The sem_trywait() function shall lock the semaphore referenced by sem
       only if the semaphore is currently not locked; that is, if the
       semaphore value is currently positive. Otherwise, it shall not lock
       the semaphore.
       The sem_wait() function shall lock the semaphore referenced by sem by
       performing a semaphore lock operation on that semaphore. If the
       semaphore value is currently zero, then the calling thread shall not
       return from the call to sem_wait() until it either locks the
       semaphore or the call is interrupted by a signal.
       Upon successful return, the state of the semaphore shall be locked
       and shall remain locked until the sem_post() function is executed and
       returns successfully.
       The sem_wait() function is interruptible by the delivery of a signal.
