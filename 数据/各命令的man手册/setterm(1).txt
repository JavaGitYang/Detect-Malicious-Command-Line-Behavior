       setterm writes to standard output a character string that will invoke
       the specified terminal capabilities.  Where possible terminfo is
       consulted to find the string to use.  Some options however (marked
       "virtual consoles only" below) do not correspond to a terminfo(5)
       capability.  In this case, if the terminal type is "con" or "linux"
       the string that invokes the specified capabilities on the PC Minix
       virtual console driver is output.  Options that are not implemented
       by the terminal are ignored.
