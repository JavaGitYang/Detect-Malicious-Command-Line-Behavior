       quota_nld listens on netlink socket and processes received quota
       warnings. By default quota_nld forwards warning messages to both the
       system's DBUS (so that the desktop manager can display a dialog) and
       the last-accessed terminal of the user to whom each warning is
       directed. Either of these destinations can be disabled with the -D
       and -C options, respectively.
       In the case of the user's terminal, quota messages about falling
       below the hard and soft limits are not sent unless the -b option is
       specified. In the case of the DBUS, all quota messages are sent.
       Note, that you have to enable the kernel support for sending quota
       messages over netlink (in Filesystems->Quota menu).
