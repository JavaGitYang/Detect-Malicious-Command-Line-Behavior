       The wcsncmp() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       strncmp(3) function.  It compares the wide-character string pointed
       to by s1 and the wide-character string pointed to by s2, but at most
       n wide characters from each string.  In each string, the comparison
       extends only up to the first occurrence of a null wide character
       (L'\0'), if any.
