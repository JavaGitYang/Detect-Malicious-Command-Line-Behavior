       The uucp utility shall copy files named by the source-file argument
       to the destination-file argument. The files named can be on local or
       remote systems.
       The uucp utility cannot guarantee support for all character encodings
       in all circumstances. For example, transmission data may be
       restricted to 7 bits by the underlying network, 8-bit data and
       filenames need not be portable to non-internationalized systems, and
       so on. Under these circumstances, it is recommended that only
       characters defined in the ISO/IEC 646:1991 standard International
       Reference Version (equivalent to ASCII) 7-bit range of characters be
       used, and that only characters defined in the portable filename
       character set be used for naming files. The protocol for transfer of
       files is unspecified by POSIX.1‐2008.
       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
       configured to use the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008,
       Chapter 11, General Terminal Interface, but other communications
       means may be used. On systems where there are no available
       communications means (either temporarily or permanently), this
       utility shall write an error message describing the problem and exit
       with a non-zero exit status.
