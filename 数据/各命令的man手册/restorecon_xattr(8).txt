       restorecon_xattr will display the SHA1 digests added to extended
       attributes security.restorecon_last or delete the attribute
       completely. These attributes are set by restorecon(8) or setfiles(8)
       to specified directories when relabeling recursively.
       restorecon_xattr is useful for managing the extended attribute
       entries particularly when users forget what directories they ran
       restorecon(8) or setfiles(8) from.
       RAMFS and TMPFS filesystems do not support the
       security.restorecon_last extended attribute and are automatically
       excluded from searches.
       By default restorecon_xattr will display the SHA1 digests with
       "Match" appended if they match the default specfile set or the
       specfile set used with the -f option. Non-matching SHA1 digests will
       be displayed with "No Match" appended.  This feature can be disabled
       by the -n option.
