       The trace-cmd(1) check-events parses format strings for all the
       events on the local system. It returns whether all the format strings
       can be parsed correctly. It will load plugins unless specified
       otherwise.
       This is useful to check for any trace event format strings which may
       contain some internal kernel function references which cannot be
       decoded outside of the kernel. This may mean that either the unparsed
       format strings of the trace events need to be changed or that a
       plugin needs to be created to parse them.
