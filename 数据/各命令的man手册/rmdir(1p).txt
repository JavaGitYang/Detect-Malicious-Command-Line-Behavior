       The rmdir utility shall remove the directory entry specified by each
       dir operand.
       For each dir operand, the rmdir utility shall perform actions
       equivalent to the rmdir() function called with the dir operand as its
       only argument.
       Directories shall be processed in the order specified. If a directory
       and a subdirectory of that directory are specified in a single
       invocation of the rmdir utility, the application shall specify the
       subdirectory before the parent directory so that the parent directory
       will be empty when the rmdir utility tries to remove it.
