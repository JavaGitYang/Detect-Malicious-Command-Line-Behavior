       The CUPS filter interface provides a standard method for adding
       support for new document types or printers to CUPS.  Each filter is
       capable of converting from one or more input formats to another
       format that can either be printed directly or piped into another
       filter to get it to a printable format.
       Filters MUST be capable of reading from a filename on the command-
       line or from the standard input, copying the standard input to a
       temporary file as required by the file format.  All output MUST be
       sent to the standard output.  Filters MUST NOT attempt to communicate
       directly with the printer, other processes, or other services.
       The command name (argv[0]) is set to the name of the destination
       printer but is also available in the PRINTER environment variable.
