       set_matchpathcon_flags() sets the flags controlling the operation of
       matchpathcon_init(3) and subsequently matchpathcon_index(3) or
       matchpathcon(3).  If the MATCHPATHCON_BASEONLY flag is set, then only
       the base file contexts configuration file will be processed, not any
       dynamically generated entries or local customizations.
       set_matchpathcon_invalidcon() sets the function used by
       matchpathcon_init(3) when checking the validity of a context in the
       file contexts configuration.  If not set, then this defaults to a
       test based on security_check_context(3), which checks validity
       against the active policy on a SELinux system.  This can be set to
       instead perform checking based on a binary policy file, e.g. using
       sepol_check_context(3), as is done by setfiles -c.  The function is
       also responsible for reporting any such error, and may include the
       path and lineno in such error messages.
       set_matchpathcon_printf() sets the function used by
       matchpathcon_init(3) when displaying errors about the file contexts
       configuration.  If not set, then this defaults to fprintf(stderr,
       fmt, ...).  This can be set to redirect error reporting to a
       different destination.
