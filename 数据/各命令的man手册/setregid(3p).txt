       The setregid() function shall set the real and effective group IDs of
       the calling process.
       If rgid is −1, the real group ID shall not be changed; if egid is −1,
       the effective group ID shall not be changed.
       The real and effective group IDs may be set to different values in
       the same call.
       Only a process with appropriate privileges can set the real group ID
       and the effective group ID to any valid value.
       A non-privileged process can set either the real group ID to the
       saved set-group-ID from one of the exec family of functions, or the
       effective group ID to the saved set-group-ID or the real group ID.
       If the real group ID is being set (rgid is not −1), or the effective
       group ID is being set to a value not equal to the real group ID, then
       the saved set-group-ID of the current process shall be set equal to
       the new effective group ID.
       Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process remain unchanged.
