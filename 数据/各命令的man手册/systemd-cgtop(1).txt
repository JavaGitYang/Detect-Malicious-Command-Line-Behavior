       systemd-cgtop shows the top control groups of the local Linux control
       group hierarchy, ordered by their CPU, memory, or disk I/O load. The
       display is refreshed in regular intervals (by default every 1s),
       similar in style to top(1). If a control group path is specified,
       shows only the services of the specified control group.
       If systemd-cgtop is not connected to a tty, no column headers are
       printed and the default is to only run one iteration. The
       --iterations= argument, if given, is honored. This mode is suitable
       for scripting.
       Resource usage is only accounted for control groups in the relevant
       hierarchy, i.e. CPU usage is only accounted for control groups in the
       "cpuacct" hierarchy, memory usage only for those in "memory" and disk
       I/O usage for those in "blkio". If resource monitoring for these
       resources is required, it is recommended to add the CPUAccounting=1,
       MemoryAccounting=1 and BlockIOAccounting=1 settings in the unit files
       in question. See systemd.resource-control(5) for details.
       The CPU load value can be between 0 and 100 times the number of
       processors the system has. For example, if the system has 8
       processors, the CPU load value is going to be between 0% and 800%.
       The number of processors can be found in "/proc/cpuinfo".
       To emphasize this: unless "CPUAccounting=1", "MemoryAccounting=1" and
       "BlockIOAccounting=1" are enabled for the services in question, no
       resource accounting will be available for system services and the
       data shown by systemd-cgtop will be incomplete.
