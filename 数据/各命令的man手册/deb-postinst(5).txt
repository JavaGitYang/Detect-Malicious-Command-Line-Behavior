       A package can perform several post-installation actions via
       maintainer scripts, by including an executable postinst file in its
       control archive (i.e. DEBIAN/postinst during package creation).
       The script can be called in the following ways:
       postinst configure old-version
              After the package was installed.
       postinst triggered trigger-name...
              After the package was triggered.
       old-postinst abort-upgrade new-version
              If prerm fails during upgrade or fails on failed upgrade.
       old-postinst abort-remove
              If prerm fails during removal.
       postinst abort-deconfigure in-favour new-package new-version
              [ removing old-package old-version ]
              If prerm fails during deconfiguration of a package.
       postinst abort-remove in-favour new-package new-version
              If prerm fails during replacement due to conflict.
