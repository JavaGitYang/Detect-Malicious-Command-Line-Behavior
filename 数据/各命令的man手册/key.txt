       This program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel when
       kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to perform a
       hostname lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.  It is
       not ordinarily intended to be called directly.
       It can be called in debugging mode to test its functionality by
       passing a -D flag on the command line.  For this to work, the key
       description and the callout information must be supplied.  Verbosity
       can be increased by supplying one or more -v flags.
