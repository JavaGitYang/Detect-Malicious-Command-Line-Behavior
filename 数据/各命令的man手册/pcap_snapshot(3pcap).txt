       pcap_snapshot() returns the snapshot length specified when
       pcap_set_snapshot() or pcap_open_live() was called, for a live
       capture, or the snapshot length from the capture file, for a
       ``savefile''.
       It must not be called on a pcap descriptor created by pcap_create()
       that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().
