       The current reporting timezone effects the timezone used by
       pmCtime(3) and pmLocaltime(3).
       The argument tz_handle identifies a reporting timezone as previously
       established by a call to pmNewZone(3) or pmNewContextZone(3), and
       this becomes the current reporting timezone.
