       The on_exit() function registers the given function to be called at
       normal process termination, whether via exit(3) or via return from
       the program's main().  The function is passed the status argument
       given to the last call to exit(3) and the arg argument from
       on_exit().
       The same function may be registered multiple times: it is called once
       for each registration.
       When a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits copies of
       its parent's registrations.  Upon a successful call to one of the
       exec(3) functions, all registrations are removed.
