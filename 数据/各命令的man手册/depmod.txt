       The order in which modules are processed by the depmod command can be
       altered on a global or per-module basis. This is typically useful in
       cases where built-in kernel modules are complemented by custom built
       versions of the same and the user wishes to affect the priority of
       processing in order to override the module version supplied by the
       kernel.
       The format of files under depmod.d is simple: one command per line,
       with blank lines and lines starting with '#' ignored (useful for
       adding comments). A '\' at the end of a line causes it to continue on
       the next line, which makes the files a bit neater.
