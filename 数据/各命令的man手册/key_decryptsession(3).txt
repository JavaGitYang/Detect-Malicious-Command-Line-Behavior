       The functions here are used within the RPC's secure authentication
       mechanism (AUTH_DES).  There should be no need for user programs to
       use this functions.
       The function key_decryptsession() uses the (remote) server netname
       and takes the DES key for decrypting.  It uses the public key of the
       server and the secret key associated with the effective UID of the
       calling process.
       The function key_encryptsession() is the inverse of
       key_decryptsession().  It encrypts the DES keys with the public key
       of the server and the secret key associated with the effective UID of
       the calling process.
       The function key_gendes() is used to ask the keyserver for a secure
       conversation key.
       The function key_setsecret() is used to set the key for the effective
       UID of the calling process.
       The function key_secretkey_is_set() can be used to determine whether
       a key has been set for the effective UID of the calling process.
