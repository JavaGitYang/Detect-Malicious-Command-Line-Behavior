       /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides an interface to read and write the
       model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  CPUNUM is the number
       of the CPU to access as listed in /proc/cpuinfo.
       The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to the
       MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing in
       chunks of 8 bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means
       multiple reads or writes of the same register.
       This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by the
       user root, or members of the group root.
