       This manual page describes the GNU version of pic, which is part of
       the groff document formatting system.  pic compiles descriptions of
       pictures embedded within troff or TeX input files into commands that
       are understood by TeX or troff.  Each picture starts with a line
       beginning with .PS and ends with a line beginning with .PE.  Anything
       outside of .PS and .PE is passed through without change.
       It is the user's responsibility to provide appropriate definitions of
       the PS and PE macros.  When the macro package being used does not
       supply such definitions (for example, old versions of -ms),
       appropriate definitions can be obtained with -mpic: These will center
       each picture.
