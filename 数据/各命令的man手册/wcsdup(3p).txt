       The wcsdup() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       strdup() function.
       The wcsdup() function shall return a pointer to a new wide-character
       string, allocated as if by a call to malloc(), which is the duplicate
       of the wide-character string string.  The returned pointer can be
       passed to free().  A null pointer is returned if the new wide-
       character string cannot be created.
