       For tolower(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The tolower() and tolower_l() functions have as a domain a type int,
       the value of which is representable as an unsigned char or the value
       of EOF. If the argument has any other value, the behavior is
       undefined. If the argument of tolower() or tolower_l() represents an
       uppercase letter, and there exists a corresponding lowercase letter
       as defined by character type information in the current locale or in
       the locale represented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE),
       the result shall be the corresponding lowercase letter. All other
       arguments in the domain are returned unchanged.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to tolower_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
