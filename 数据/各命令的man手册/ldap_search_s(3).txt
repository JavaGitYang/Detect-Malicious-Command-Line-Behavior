       These routines are used to perform LDAP search operations.  The
       ldap_search_ext_s() routine does the search synchronously (i.e., not
       returning until the operation completes), providing a pointer to the
       resulting LDAP messages at the location pointed to by the res
       parameter.
       The ldap_search_ext() routine is the asynchronous version, initiating
       the search and returning the message id of the operation it initiated
       in the integer pointed to by the msgidp parameter.
       The base parameter is the DN of the entry at which to start the
       search.
       The scope parameter is the scope of the search and should be one of
       LDAP_SCOPE_BASE, to search the object itself, LDAP_SCOPE_ONELEVEL, to
       search the object's immediate children, LDAP_SCOPE_SUBTREE, to search
       the object and all its descendants, or LDAP_SCOPE_CHILDREN, to search
       all of the descendants.   Note that the latter requires the server
       support the LDAP Subordinates Search Scope extension.
       The filter is a string representation of the filter to apply in the
       search.  The string should conform to the format specified in RFC
       4515 as extended by RFC 4526.  For instance, "(cn=Jane Doe)".  Note
       that use of the extension requires the server to support the LDAP
       Absolute True/False Filter extension.  NULL may be specified to
       indicate the library should send the filter (objectClass=*).
       The attrs parameter is a null-terminated array of attribute
       descriptions to return from matching entries.  If NULL is specified,
       the return of all user attributes is requested.  The description "*"
       (LDAP_ALL_USER_ATTRIBUTES) may be used to request all user attributes
       to be returned.  The description "+"(LDAP_ALL_OPERATIONAL_ATTRIBUTES)
       may be used to request all operational attributes to be returned.
       Note that this requires the server to support the LDAP All
       Operational Attribute extension.  To request no attributes, the
       description "1.1" (LDAP_NO_ATTRS) should be listed by itself.
       The attrsonly parameter should be set to a non-zero value if only
       attribute descriptions are wanted.  It should be set to zero (0) if
       both attributes descriptions and attribute values are wanted.
       The serverctrls and clientctrls parameters may be used to specify
       server and client controls, respectively.
       The ldap_search_ext_s() routine is the synchronous version of
       ldap_search_ext().
       It also returns a code indicating success or, in the case of failure,
       indicating the nature of the failure of the operation.  See
       ldap_error(3) for details.
