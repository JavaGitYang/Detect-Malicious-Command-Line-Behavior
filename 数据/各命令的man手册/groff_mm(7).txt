       The groff mm macros are intended to be compatible with the DWB mm
       macros with the following limitations:
       ·      No Bell Labs localisms are implemented.
       ·      The macros OK and PM are not implemented.
       ·      groff mm does not support cut marks.
       mm is intended to support easy localization.  Use mmse as an example
       how to adapt the output format to a national standard.  Localized
       strings are collected in the file
       ‘/usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac/xx.tmac’, where xx denotes the
       two-letter code for the language, as defined in the ISO 639 standard.
       For Swedish, this is ‘sv.tmac’ – not ‘se’, which is the ISO 3166 two-
       letter code for the country (as used for the output format
       localization).
       A file called locale or country_locale is read after the
       initialization of the global variables.  It is therefore possible to
       localize the macros with a different company name and so on.
       In this manual, square brackets are used to show optional arguments.
   Number registers and strings
       Many macros can be controlled by number registers and strings.  A
       number register is assigned with the nr command:
              .nr XXX [±]n [i]
       XXX is the name of the register, n is the value to be assigned, and
       i is the increment value for auto-increment.  n can have a plus or
       minus sign as a prefix if an increment or decrement of the current
       value is wanted.  (Auto-increment or auto-decrement occurs if the
       number register is used with a plus or minus sign, \n+[XXX] or
       \n-[XXX].)
       Strings are defined with ds.
              .ds YYY string
       The string is assigned everything to the end of the line, even
       blanks.  Initial blanks in string should be prefixed with a double-
       quote.  (Strings are used in the text as \*[YYY].)
   Special formatting of number registers
       A number register is printed with normal digits if no format has been
       given.  Set the format with af:
              .af R c
       R is the name of the register, c is the format.
              Form   Sequence
              1      0, 1, 2, 3, ...
              001    000, 001, 002, 003, ...
              i      0, i, ii, iii, iv, ...
              I      0, I, II, III, IV, ...
              a      0, a, b, c, ..., z, aa, ab, ...
              A      0, A, B, C, ..., Z, AA, AB, ...
   Fonts
       In mm, the fonts (or rather, font styles) R (normal), I (italic), and
       B (bold) are hardwired to font positions 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
       Internally, font positions are used for backwards compatibility.
       From a practical point of view it doesn't make a big difference – a
       different font family can still be selected with a call to the .fam
       request or using groff's -f command-line option.  On the other hand,
       if you want to replace just, say, font B, you have to replace the
       font at position 2 (with a call to ‘.fp 2 ...’).
   Macros
       )E level text
              Add heading text text to the table of contents with level,
              which is either 0 or in the range 1 to 7.  See also .H.  This
              macro is used for customized tables of contents.
       1C [1] Begin one-column processing.  A 1 as an argument disables the
              page break.  Use wide footnotes, small footnotes may be
              overprinted.
       2C     Begin two-column processing.  Splits the page in two columns.
              It is a special case of MC.  See also 1C.
       AE     Abstract end, see AS.
       AF [name-of-firm]
              Author's firm, should be called before AU, see also COVER.
       AL [type [text-indent [1]]]
              Start auto-increment list.  Items are numbered beginning with
              one.  The type argument controls the format of numbers.
                     Arg   Description
                     1     Arabic (the default)
                     A     Upper-case letters (A–Z)
                     a     Lower-case letters (a–z)
                     I     Upper-case roman
                     i     Lower-case roman
              text-indent sets the indentation and overrides Li.  A third
              argument prohibits printing of a blank line before each item.
       APP name text
              Begin an appendix with name name.  Automatic naming occurs if
              name is "".  The appendices start with A if automatic naming
              is used.  A new page is ejected, and a header is also produced
              if the number variable Aph is non-zero.  This is the default.
              The appendix always appears in the ‘List of contents’ with
              correct page numbers.  The name ‘APPENDIX’ can be changed by
              setting the string App to the desired text.  The string Apptxt
              contains the current appendix text.
       APPSK name pages text
              Same as .APP, but the page number is incremented with pages.
              This is used when diagrams or other non-formatted documents
              are included as appendices.
       AS [arg [indent]]
              Abstract start.  Indentation is specified in ‘ens’, but
              scaling is allowed.  Argument arg controls where the abstract
              is printed.
              Arg   Placement
              0     Abstract is printed on page 1 and on the cover sheet if
                    used in the released-paper style (MT 4), otherwise it is
                    printed on page 1 without a cover sheet.
              1     Abstract is only printed on the cover sheet (MT 4 only).
              2     Abstract is printed only on the cover sheet (other than
                    MT 4 only).  The cover sheet is printed without a need
                    for CS.
              An abstract is not printed at all in external letters (MT 5).
              The indent parameter controls the indentation of both margins,
              otherwise normal text indentation is used.
       AST [title]
              Abstract title.  Default is ‘ABSTRACT’.  Sets the text above
              the abstract text.
       AT title1 [title2 [...]]
              Author's title.  AT must appear just after each AU.  The title
              shows up after the name in the signature block.
       AU [name [initials [loc [dept [ext [room [arg [arg [arg]]]]]]]]]
              Author information.  Specifies the author of the memo or
              paper, and is printed on the cover sheet and on other similar
              places.  AU must not appear before TL.  The author information
              can contain initials, location, department, telephone
              extension, room number or name and up to three extra
              arguments.
       AV [name [1]]
              Approval signature.  Generates an approval line with place for
              signature and date.  The string ‘APPROVED:’ can be changed
              with variable Letapp; it is replaced with an empty lin if
              there is a second argument.  The string ‘Date’ can be changed
              with variable Letdate.
       AVL [name]
              Letter signature.  Generates a line with place for signature.
       B [bold-text [prev-font-text [bold [...]]]]
              Begin boldface.  No limit on the number of arguments.  All
              arguments are concatenated to one word; the first, third and
              so on is printed in boldface.
       B1     Begin box (as the ms macro).  Draws a box around the text.
              The text is indented one character, and the right margin is
              one character shorter.
       B2     End box.  Finishes the box started with B1.
       BE     End bottom block, see BS.
       BI [bold-text [italic-text [bold-text [...]]]]
              Bold-italic.  No limit on the number of arguments, see B.
       BL [text-indent [1]]
              Start bullet list.  Initializes a list with a bullet and a
              space in the beginning of each list item (see LI).  text-
              indent overrides the default indentation of the list items set
              by number register Pi.  A third argument prohibits printing of
              a blank line before each item.
       BR [bold-text [roman-text [bold-text [...]]]]
              Bold-roman.  No limit on the number of arguments.
       BS     Bottom block start.  Begins the definition of a text block
              which is printed at the bottom of each page.  The block ends
              with BE.
       BVL text-indent [mark-indent [1]]
              Start of broken variable-item list.  Broken variable-item list
              has no fixed mark, it assumes that every LI has a mark
              instead.  The text always begins at the next line after the
              mark.  text-indent sets the indentation to the text, and mark-
              indent the distance from the current indentation to the mark.
              A third argument prohibits printing of a blank line before
              each item.
       COVER [arg]
              Begin a coversheet definition.  It is important that .COVER
              appears before any normal text.  This macro uses arg to build
              the filename ‘/usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac/mm/arg.cov’.
              Therefore it is possible to create unlimited types of cover
              sheets.  ‘ms.cov’ is supposed to look like the ms cover sheet.
              .COVER requires a .COVEND at the end of the cover definition.
              Always use this order of the cover macros:
                     .COVER
                     .TL
                     .AF
                     .AU
                     .AT
                     .AS
                     .AE
                     .COVEND
              However, only .TL and .AU are required.
       COVEND Finish the cover description and print the cover page.  It is
              defined in the cover file.
       DE     Display end.  Ends a block of text or display that begins with
              DS or DF.
       DF [format [fill [rindent]]]
              Begin floating display (no nesting allowed).  A floating
              display is saved in a queue and is printed in the order
              entered.  Format, fill, and rindent are the same as in DS.
              Floating displays are controlled by the two number registers
              De and Df.
              De register
                     0   Nothing special, this is the default.
                     1   A page eject occurs after each printed display,
                         giving only one display per page and no text
                         following it.
              Df register
                     0   Displays are printed at the end of each section
                         (when section-page numbering is active) or at the
                         end of the document.
                     1   A new display is printed on the current page if
                         there is enough space, otherwise it is printed at
                         the end of the document.
                     2   One display is printed at the top of each page or
                         column (in multi-column mode).
                     3   Print one display if there is enough space for it,
                         otherwise it is printed at the top of the next page
                         or column.
                     4   Print as many displays as possible in a new page or
                         column.  A page break occurs between each display
                         if De is not zero.
                     5   Fill the current page with displays and the rest
                         beginning at a new page or column.  (This is the
                         default.)  A page break occurs between each display
                         if De is not zero.
       DL [text-indent [1 [1]]]
              Dash list start.  Begins a list where each item is printed
              after a dash.  text-indent changes the default indentation of
              the list items set by number register Pi.  A second argument
              prevents an empty line between each list item.  See LI.  A
              third argument prohibits printing of a blank line before each
              item.
       DS [format [fill [rindent]]]
              Static display start.  Begins collection of text until DE.
              The text is printed together on the same page, unless it is
              longer than the height of the page.  DS can be nested
              arbitrarily.
              format
                     ""     No indentation.
                     none   No indentation.
                     L      No indentation.
                     I      Indent text with the value of number register
                            Si.
                     C      Center each line.
                     CB     Center the whole display as a block.
                     R      Right-adjust the lines.
                     RB     Right-adjust the whole display as a block.
              The values ‘L’, ‘I’, ‘C’, and ‘CB’ can also be specified as
              ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2’, and ‘3’, respectively, for compatibility
              reasons.
              fill
                     ""     Line-filling turned off.
                     none   Line-filling turned off.
                     N      Line-filling turned off.
                     F      Line-filling turned on.
              ‘N’ and ‘F’ can also be specified as ‘0’ and ‘1’,
              respectively.
              By default, an empty line is printed before and after the
              display.  Setting number register Ds to 0 prevents this.
              rindent shortens the line length by that amount.
       EC [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Equation title.  Sets a title for an equation.  The override
              argument changes the numbering.
              flag
                     none   override is a prefix to the number.
                     0      override is a prefix to the number.
                     1      override is a suffix to the number.
                     2      override replaces the number.
              EC uses the number register Ec as a counter.  It is possible
              to use .af to change the format of the number.  If number
              register Of is 1, the format of title uses a dash instead of a
              dot after the number.
              The string Le controls the title of the List of Equations;
              default is ‘LIST OF EQUATIONS’.  The List of Equations is only
              printed if number register Le is 1.  The default is 0.  The
              string Liec contains the word ‘Equation’, which is printed
              before the number.  If refname is used, then the equation
              number is saved with .SETR, and can be retrieved with ‘.GETST
              refname’.
              Special handling of the title occurs if EC is used inside
              DS/DE; it is not affected by the format of DS.
       EF [arg]
              Even-page footer, printed just above the normal page footer on
              even pages.  See PF.
              This macro defines string EOPef.
       EH [arg]
              Even-page header, printed just below the normal page header on
              even pages.  See PH.
              This macro defines string TPeh.
       EN     Equation end, see EQ.
       EOP    End-of-page user-defined macro.  This macro is called instead
              of the normal printing of the footer.  The macro is executed
              in a separate environment, without any trap active.  See TP.
              Strings available to EOP
              EOPf    argument of PF
              EOPef   argument of EF
              EOPof   argument of OF
       EPIC [-L] width height [name]
              Draw a box with the given width and height.  It also prints
              the text name or a default string if name is not specified.
              This is used to include external pictures; just give the size
              of the picture.  -L left-adjusts the picture; the default is
              to center.  See PIC.
       EQ [label]
              Equation start.  EQ/EN are the delimiters for equations
              written for eqn(1).  EQ/EN must be inside of a DS/DE pair,
              except if EQ is used to set options for eqn only.  The label
              argument appears at the right margin of the equation, centered
              vertically within the DS/DE block, unless number register Eq
              is 1.  Then the label appears at the left margin.
              If there are multiple EQ/EN blocks within a single DS/DE pair,
              only the last equation label (if any) is printed.
       EX [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Exhibit title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  EX uses
              the number register Ex as a counter.  The string Lx controls
              the title of the List of Exhibits; default is ‘LIST OF
              EXHIBITS’.  The List of Exhibits is only printed if number
              register Lx is 1, which is the default.  The string Liex
              contains the word ‘Exhibit’, which is printed before the
              number.  If refname is used, the exhibit number is saved with
              .SETR, and can be retrieved with ‘.GETST refname’.
              Special handling of the title occurs if EX is used inside
              DS/DE; it is not affected by the format of DS.
       FC [closing]
              Print ‘Yours very truly,’ as a formal closing of a letter or
              memorandum.  The argument replaces the default string.  The
              default is stored in string variable Letfc.
       FD [arg [1]]
              Footnote default format.  Controls the hyphenation (hyphen),
              right margin justification (adjust), and indentation of
              footnote text (indent).  It can also change the label

              value 0.  Default for mm is 10.
       FE     Footnote end.
       FG [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Figure title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  FG uses
              the number register Fg as a counter.  The string Lf controls
              the title of the List of Figures; default is ‘LIST OF
              FIGURES’.  The List of Figures is only printed if number
              register Lf is 1, which is the default.  The string Lifg
              contains the word ‘Figure’, which is printed before the
              number.  If refname is used, then the figure number is saved
              with .SETR, and can be retrieved with ‘.GETST refname’.
              Special handling of the title occurs if FG is used inside
              DS/DE, it is not affected by the format of DS.
       FS [label]
              Footnote start.  The footnote is ended by FE.  By default,
              footnotes are automatically numbered; the number is available
              in string F.  Just add \*F in the text.  By adding label, it
              is possible to have other number or names on the footnotes.
              Footnotes in displays are now possible.  An empty line
              separates footnotes; the height of the line is controlled by
              number register Fs, default value is 1.
       GETHN refname [varname]
              Include the header number where the corresponding ‘SETR
              refname’ was placed.  This is displayed as ‘X.X.X.’ in pass 1.
              See INITR.  If varname is used, GETHN sets the string variable
              varname to the header number.
       GETPN refname [varname]
              Include the page number where the corresponding ‘SETR refname’
              was placed.  This is displayed as ‘9999’ in pass 1.  See
              INITR.  If varname is used, GETPN sets the stringvariable
              varname to the page number.
       GETR refname
              Combine GETHN and GETPN with the text ‘chapter’ and ‘, page’.
              The string Qrf contains the text for the cross reference:
                     .ds Qrf See chapter \\*[Qrfh], page \\*[Qrfp].
              Qrf may be changed to support other languages.  Strings Qrfh
              and Qrfp are set by GETR and contain the page and header
              number, respectively.
       GETST refname [varname]
              Include the string saved with the second argument to .SETR.
              This is a dummy string in pass 1.  If varname is used, GETST
              sets it to the saved string.  See INITR.
       H level [heading-text [heading-suffix]]
              Numbered section heading.  Section headers can have a level
              between 1 and 14; level 1 is the top level.  The text is given
              in heading-text, and must be surrounded by double quotes if it
              contains spaces.  heading-suffix is added to the header in the
              text but not in the table of contents.  This is normally used
              for footnote marks and similar things.  Don't use \*F in
              heading-suffix, it doesn't work.  A manual label must be used,
              see FS.
              A call to the paragraph macro P directly after H is ignored.
              H takes care of spacing and indentation.
              Page ejection before heading
                     Number register Ej controls page ejection before the
                     heading.  By default, a level-one heading gets two
                     blank lines before it; higher levels only get one.  A
                     new page is ejected before each first-level heading if
                     number register Ej is 1.  All levels below or equal the
                     value of Ej get a new page.  Default value for Ej is 0.
              Heading break level
                     A line break occurs after the heading if the heading
                     level is less or equal to number register Hb.  Default
                     value is 2.
              Heading space level
                     A blank line is inserted after the heading if the
                     heading level is less or equal to number register Hs.
                     Default value is 2.
                     Text follows the heading on the same line if the level
                     is greater than both Hb and Hs.
              Post-heading indent
                     Indentation of the text after the heading is controlled
                     by number register Hi.  Default value is 0.
                     Hi
                     0   The text is left-justified.
                     1   Indentation of the text follows the value of number
                         register Pt , see P.
                     2   The text is lined up with the first word of the
                         heading.
              Centered section headings
                     All headings whose level is equal or below number
                     register Hc and also less than or equal to Hb or Hs are
                     centered.
              Font control of the heading
                     The font of each heading level is controlled by string
                     HF.  It contains a font number or font name for each
                     level.  Default value is
                            2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2
                     (all headings in italic).  This could also be written
                     as
                            I I I I I I I I I I I I I I
                     Note that some other implementations use 3 3 2 2 2 2 2
                     as the default value.  All omitted values are presumed
                     to have value 1.
              Point size control
                     String HP controls the point size of each heading, in
                     the same way as HF controls the font.  A value of 0
                     selects the default point size.  Default value is
                            0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                     Beware that only the point size changes, not the
                     vertical size.  The latter can be controlled by the
                     user-specified macros HX and/or HZ.
              Heading counters
                     Fourteen number registers named H1 up to H14 contain
                     the counter for each heading level.  The values are
                     printed using Arabic numerals; this can be changed with
                     the macro HM (see below).  All marks are concatenated
                     before printing.  To avoid this, set number register Ht
                     to 1.  This only prints the current heading counter at
                     each heading.
              Automatic table of contents
                     All headings whose level is equal or below number
                     register Cl are saved to be printed in the table of
                     contents.  Default value is 2.
              Special control of the heading, user-defined macros
                     The following macros can be defined by the user to get
                     a finer control of vertical spacing, fonts, or other
                     features.  Argument level is the level-argument to H,
                     but 0 for unnumbered headings (see HU).  Argument
                     rlevel is the real level; it is set to number register
                     Hu for unnumbered headings.  Argument heading-text is
                     the text argument to H and HU.
                     HX level rlevel heading-text
                            This macro is called just before the printing of
                            the heading.  The following registers are
                            available for HX.  Note that HX may alter }0,
                            }2, and ;3.
                            }0 (string)
                                   Contains the heading mark plus two spaces
                                   if rlevel is non-zero, otherwise empty.
                            ;0 (register)
                                   Contains the position of the text after
                                   the heading.  0 means that the text
                                   should follow the heading on the same
                                   line, 1 means that a line break should
                                   occur before the text, and 2 means that a
                                   blank line should separate the heading
                                   and the text.
                            }2 (string)
                                   Contains two spaces if register ;0 is 0.
                                   It is used to separate the heading from
                                   the text.  The string is empty if ;0 is
                                   non-zero.
                            ;3 (register)
                                   Contains the needed space in units after
                                   the heading.  Default is 2v.  Can be used
                                   to change things like numbering (}0),
                                   vertical spacing (}2), and the needed
                                   space after the heading.
                     HY dlevel rlevel heading-text
                            This macro is called after size and font
                            calculations and might be used to change
                            indentation.
                     HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text
                            This macro is called after the printing of the
                            heading, just before H or HU exits.  Can be used
                            to change the page header according to the
                            section heading.
       HC [hyphenation-character]
              Set hyphenation character.  Default value is ‘\%’.  Resets to
              the default if called without argument.  Hyphenation can be
              turned off by setting number register Hy to 0 at the beginning
              of the file.
       HM [arg1 [arg2 [... [arg14]]]]
              Heading mark style.  Controls the type of marking for printing
              of the heading counters.  Default is 1 for all levels.
              Argument
              1      Arabic numerals.
              0001   Arabic numerals with leading zeroes, one or more.
              A      upper-case alphabetic
              a      lower-case alphabetic
              I      upper-case roman numerals
              i      lower-case roman numerals
              ""     Arabic numerals.
       HU heading-text
              Unnumbered section header.  HU behaves like H at the level in
              number register Hu.  See H.
       HX dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined heading exit.  Called just before printing the
              header.  See H.
       HY dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined heading exit.  Called just before printing the
              header.  See H.
       HZ dlevel rlevel heading-text
              User-defined heading exit.  Called just after printing the
              header.  See H.
       I [italic-text [prev-font-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic.  Changes the font to italic if called without
              arguments.  With one argument it sets the word in italic.
              With two arguments it concatenates them and sets the first
              word in italic and the second in the previous font.  There is
              no limit on the number of argument; all are concatenated.
       IA [addressee-name [title]]
              Begin specification of the addressee and addressee's address
              in letter style.  Several names can be specified with empty
              IA/IE-pairs, but only one address.  See LT.
       IB [italic-text [bold-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic-bold.  Even arguments are printed in italic, odd in
              boldface.  See I.
       IE     End the address specification after IA.
       INITI type filename [macro]
              Initialize the new index system and set the filename to
              collect index lines in with IND.  Argument type selects the
              type of index: page number, header marks or both.  The default
              is page numbers.
              It is also possible to create a macro that is responsible for
              formatting each row; just add the name of the macro as a third
              argument.  The macro is then called with the index as
              argument(s).
              type
              N   Page numbers
              H   Header marks
              B   Both page numbers and header marks, separated with a tab
                  character.
       INITR filename
              Initialize the cross reference macros.  Cross references are
              written to stderr and are supposed to be redirected into file
              ‘filename.qrf’.  Requires two passes with groff; this is
              handled by a separate program called mmroff(1).  This program
              exists because groff(1) by default deactivates the unsafe
              operations that are required by INITR.  The first pass looks
              for cross references, and the second one includes them.  INITR
              can be used several times, but it is only the first occurrence
              of INITR that is active.
              See also SETR, GETPN, and GETHN.
       IND arg1 [arg2 [...]]
              Write a line in the index file selected by INITI with all
              arguments and the page number or header mark separated by
              tabs.
                     Examples
                     arg1\tpage number
                     arg1\targ2\tpage number
                     arg1\theader mark
                     arg1\tpage number\theader mark
       INDP   Print the index by running the command specified by string
              variable Indcmd, which has ‘sort -t\t’ as the default value.
              INDP reads the output from the command to form the index, by
              default in two columns (this can be changed by defining
              TYIND).  The index is printed with string variable Index as
              header, default is ‘INDEX’.  One-column processing is
              reactivated after the list.  INDP calls the user-defined
              macros TXIND, TYIND, and TZIND if defined.  TXIND is called
              before printing the string ‘INDEX’, TYIND is called instead of
              printing ‘INDEX’, and TZIND is called after the printing and
              should take care of restoring to normal operation again.
       ISODATE [0]
              Change the predefined date string in DT to ISO-format, this
              is, ‘YYYY-MM-DD’.  This can also be done by adding -rIso=1 on
              the command line.  Reverts to old date format if argument
              is 0.
       IR [italic-text [roman-text [italic-text [...]]]]
              Italic-roman.  Even arguments are printed in italic, odd in
              roman.  See I.
       LB text-indent mark-indent pad type [mark [LI-space [LB-space]]]
              List-begin macro.  This is the common macro used for all
              lists.  text-indent is the number of spaces to indent the text
              from the current indentation.
              pad and mark-indent control where to put the mark.  The mark
              is placed within the mark area, and mark-indent sets the
              number of spaces before this area.  By default it is 0.  The
              mark area ends where the text begins.  The start of the text
              is still controlled by text-indent.
              The mark is left-justified within the mark area if pad is 0.
              If pad is greater than 0, mark-indent is ignored, and the mark
              is placed pad spaces before the text.  This right-justifies
              the mark.
              If type is 0 the list either has a hanging indentation or, if
              argument mark is given, the string mark as a mark.
              If type is greater than 0 automatic numbering occurs, using
              arabic numbers if mark is empty.  mark can then be any of ‘1’,
              ‘A’, ‘a’, ‘I’, or ‘i’.
              type selects one of six possible ways to display the mark.
              type
                     1   x.
                     2   x)
                     3   (x)
                     4   [x]
                     5   <x>
                     6   {x}
              Every item in the list gets LI-space number of blank lines
              before them.  Default is 1.
              LB itself prints LB-space blank lines.  Default is 0.
       LC [list-level]
              List-status clear.  Terminates all current active lists down
              to list-level, or 0 if no argument is given.  This is used
              by H to clear any active list.
       LE [1] List end.  Terminates the current list.  LE outputs a blank
              line if an argument is given.
       LI [mark [1|2]]
              List item preceding every item in a list.  Without argument,
              LI prints the mark determined by the current list type.  By
              giving LI one argument, it uses that as the mark instead.  Two
              arguments to LI makes mark a prefix to the current mark.
              There is no separating space between the prefix and the mark
              if the second argument is ‘2’ instead of ‘1’.  This behaviour
              can also be achieved by setting number register Limsp to zero.
              A zero length mark makes a hanging indentation instead.
              A blank line is printed before the list item by default.  This
              behaviour can be controlled by number register Ls.  Pre-
              spacing occurs for each list level less than or equal to Ls.
              Default value is 99.  There is no nesting limit.
              The indentation can be changed through number register Li.
              Default is 6.
              All lists begin with a list initialization macro, LB.  There
              are, however, seven predefined list types to make lists easier
              to use.  They all call LB with different default values.

       LT [arg]
              Format a letter in one of four different styles depending on
              the argument.  See also section INTERNALS.
                     Arg   Style
                     BL    Blocked.  Date line, return address, writer's
                           address and closing begins at the center of the
                           line.  All other lines begin at the left margin.
                     SB    Semi-blocked.  Same as blocked, except that the
                           first line in every paragraph is indented five
                           spaces.
                     FB    Full-blocked.  All lines begin at the left
                           margin.
                     SP    Simplified.  Almost the same as the full-blocked
                           style.  Subject and the writer's identification
                           are printed in all-capital.
       LO type [arg]
              Specify options in letter (see .LT).  This is a list of the
              standard options:
                     CN   Confidential notation.  Prints ‘CONFIDENTIAL’ on
                          the second line below the date line.  Any argument
                          replaces ‘CONFIDENTIAL’.  See also string variable
                          LetCN.
                     RN   Reference notation.  Prints ‘In reference to:’ and
                          the argument two lines below the date line.  See
                          also string variable LetRN.
                     AT   Attention.  Prints ‘ATTENTION:’ and the argument
                          below the inside address.  See also string
                          variable LetAT.
                     SA   Salutation.  Prints ’To Whom It May Concern:’ or
                          the argument if it was present.  The salutation is
                          printed two lines below the inside address.  See
                          also string variable LetSA.
                     SJ   Subject line.  Prints the argument as subject
                          prefixed with ‘SUBJECT:’ two lines below the
                          inside address, except in letter type ‘SP’, where
                          the subject is printed in all-capital without any
                          prefix.  See also string variable LetSJ.
       MC column-size [column-separation]
              Begin multiple columns.  Return to normal with 1C.  MC creates
              as many columns as the current line length permits.  column-
              size is the width of each column, and column-separation is the
              space between two columns.  Default separation is column-
              size/15.  See also 1C.
       ML mark [text-indent [1]]
              Marked list start.  The mark argument is printed before each
              list item.  text-indent sets the indent and overrides Li.  A
              third argument prohibits printing of a blank line before each
              item.
       MT [arg [addressee]]
              Memorandum type.  The argument arg is part of a filename in
              ‘/usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac/mm/*.MT’.  Memorandum
              types 0 to 5 are supported, including type ‘string’ (which
              gets internally mapped to type 6).  addressee just sets a
              variable, used in the AT&T macros.
              arg
                     0   Normal memorandum, no type printed.
                     1   Memorandum with ‘MEMORANDUM FOR FILE’ printed.
                     2   Memorandum with ‘PROGRAMMER'S NOTES’ printed.
                     3   Memorandum with ‘ENGINEER'S NOTES’ printed.
                     4   Released paper style.
                     5   External letter style.
              See also COVER/COVEND, a more flexible type of front page.
       MOVE y-pos [x-pos [line-length]]
              Move to a position, setting page offset to x-pos.  If line-
              length is not given, the difference between current and new
              page offset is used.  Use PGFORM without arguments to return
              to normal.
       MULB cw1 space1 [cw2 space2 [cw3 ...]]
              Begin a special multi-column mode.  All columns widths must be
              specified.  The space between the columns must be specified
              also.  The last column does not need any space definition.
              MULB starts a diversion, and MULE ends the diversion and
              prints the columns.  The unit for the width and space
              arguments is ‘n’, but MULB accepts all normal unit
              specifications like ‘c’ and ‘i’.  MULB operates in a separate
              environment.
       MULN   Begin the next column.  This is the only way to switch the
              column.
       MULE   End the multi-column mode and print the columns.
       nP [type]
              Print numbered paragraph with header level two.  See .P.
       NCOL   Force printing to the next column.  Don't use this together
              with the MUL* macros, see 2C.
       NS [arg [1]]
              Print different types of notations.  The argument selects
              between the predefined type of notations.  If the second
              argument is available, then the argument becomes the entire
              notation.  If the argument doesn't select a predefined type,
              it is printed as ‘Copy (arg) to’.  It is possible to add more
              standard notations, see the string variables Letns and
              Letnsdef.
                     Arg    Notation
                     none   Copy To

                     14     CC
       ND new-date
              New date.  Overrides the current date.  Date is not printed if
              new-date is an empty string.
       OF [arg]
              Odd-page footer, a line printed just above the normal footer.
              See EF and PF.
              This macro defines string EOPof.
       OH [arg]
              Odd-page header, a line printed just below the normal header.
              See EH and PH.
              This macro defines string TPoh.
       OP     Make sure that the following text is printed at the top of an
              odd-numbered page.  Does not output an empty page if currently
              at the top of an odd page.
       P [type]
              Begin new paragraph.  P without argument produces
              left-justified text, even the first line of the paragraph.
              This is the same as setting type to 0.  If the argument is 1,
              the first line of text following P is indented by the number
              of spaces in number register Pi, by default 5.
              Instead of giving an argument to P it is possible to set the
              paragraph type in number register Pt.  Using 0 and 1 is the
              same as adding that value to P.  A value of 2 indents all
              paragraphs, except after headings, lists, and displays (this
              value can't be used as an argument to P itself).
              The space between two paragraphs is controlled by number
              register Ps, and is 1 by default (one blank line).
       PGFORM [linelength [pagelength [pageoffset [1]]]]
              Set line length, page length, and/or page offset.  This macro
              can be used for special formatting, like letter heads and
              other.  It is normally the first command in a file, though it
              is not necessary.  PGFORM can be used without arguments to
              reset everything after a MOVE call.  A line break is done
              unless the fourth argument is given.  This can be used to
              avoid the page number on the first page while setting new
              width and length.  (It seems as if this macro sometimes
              doesn't work too well.  Use the command-line arguments to
              change line length, page length, and page offset instead.)
       PGNH   No header is printed on the next page.  Used to get rid of the
              header in letters or other special texts.  This macro must be
              used before any text to inhibit the page header on the first
              page.
       PIC [-B] [-L] [-C] [-R] [-I n] filename [width [height]]
              Include a PostScript file in the document.  The macro depends
              on mmroff(1) and INITR.  The arguments -L, -C, -R, and -I n
              adjust the picture or indent it.  With no flag the picture is
              adjusted to the left.  Adding -B draws a box around the
              picture.  The optional width and height can also be given to
              resize the picture.
       PE     Picture end.  Ends a picture for pic(@MAN1EXT).
       PF [arg]
              Page footer.  PF sets the line to be printed at the bottom of
              each page.  Empty by default.  See PH for the argument
              specification.
              This macro defines string EOPf.
       PH [arg]
              Page header, a line printed at the top of each page.  The
              argument should be specified as
                     "'left-part'center-part'right-part'"
              where left-part, center-part, and right-part are printed left-
              justified, centered, and right justified, respectively.
              Within the argument to PH, the character ‘%’ is changed to the
              current page number.  The default argument is
                     "''- % -''"
              which gives the page number between two dashes.
              This macro defines string TPh.
       PS     Picture start (from pic).  Begins a picture for pic(1).
       PX     Page header user-defined exit.  This macro is called just
              after the printing of the page header in no-space mode.
       R      Roman.  Return to roman font, see also I.
       RB [roman-text [bold-text [roman-text [...]]]]
              Roman-bold.  Even arguments are printed in roman, odd in
              boldface.  See I.
       RD [prompt [diversion [string]]]
              Read from standard input to diversion and/or string.  The text
              is saved in a diversion named diversion.  Recall the text by
              writing the name of the diversion after a dot on an empty
              line.  A string is also defined if string is given.  Diversion
              and/or prompt can be empty ("").
       RF     Reference end.  Ends a reference definition and returns to
              normal processing.  See RS.
       RI [roman-text [italic-text [roman-text [...]]]]
              Print even arguments in roman, odd in italic.  See I.
       RL [text-indent[1]]
              Reference list start.  Begins a list where each item is
              preceded with an automatically incremented number between
              square brackets.  text-indent changes the default indentation.
       RP [arg1 [arg2]]
              Produce reference page.  This macro can be used if a reference
              page is wanted somewhere in the document.  It is not needed if
              TC is used to produce a table of contents.  The reference page
              is then printed automatically.
              The reference counter is not reset if arg1 is 1.
              arg2 tells RP whether to eject a page or not.
              arg2
                     0   The reference page is printed on a separate page.
                     1   Do not eject page after the list.
                     2   Do not eject page before the list.
                     3   Do not eject page before and after the list.
              The reference items are separated by a blank line.  Setting
              number register Ls to 0 suppresses the line.
              The string Rp contains the reference page title and is set to
              ‘REFERENCES’ by default.  The number register Rpe holds the
              default value for the second argument of RP; it is initially
              set to 0.
       RS [string-name]
              Begin an automatically numbered reference definition.  Put the
              string \*(Rf where the reference mark should be and write the
              reference between RS/RF at next new line after the reference
              mark.  The reference number is stored in number register :R.
              If string-name is given, a string with that name is defined
              and contains the current reference mark.  The string can be
              referenced as \*[string-name] later in the text.
       S [size [spacing]]
              Set point size and vertical spacing.  If any argument is equal
              to ‘P’, the previous value is used.  A ‘C’ means current
              value, and ‘D’ the default value.  If ‘+’ or ‘-’ is used
              before the value, the current value is incremented or
              decremented, respectively.
       SA [arg]
              Set right-margin justification.  Justification is turned on by
              default.  No argument or value ‘0’ turns off justification,
              and ‘1’ turns on justification.
       SETR refname [string]
              Remember the current header and page number as refname.  Saves
              string if string is defined.  string is retrieved with .GETST.
              See INITR.
       SG [arg [1]]
              Signature line.  Prints the authors name(s) after the formal
              closing.  The argument is appended to the reference data,
              printed at either the first or last author.  The reference
              data is the location, department, and initials specified with
              .AU.  It is printed at the first author if the second argument
              is given, otherwise at the last.  No reference data is printed
              if the author(s) is specified through .WA/.WE.  See section
              INTERNALS.
       SK [pages]
              Skip pages.  If pages is 0 or omitted, a skip to the next page
              occurs unless it is already at the top of a page.  Otherwise
              it skips pages pages.
       SM string1 [string2 [string3]]
              Make a string smaller.  If string2 is given, string1 is made
              smaller and string2 stays at normal size, concatenated with
              string1.  With three arguments, everything is concatenated,
              but only string2 is made smaller.
       SP [lines]
              Space vertically.  lines can have any scaling factor, like
              ‘3i’ or ‘8v’.  Several SP calls in a line only produces the
              maximum number of lines, not the sum.  SP is ignored also
              until the first text line in a page.  Add \& before a call to
              SP to avoid this.
       TAB    Reset tabs to every 5n.  Normally used to reset any previous
              tab positions.
       TB [title [override [flag [refname]]]]
              Table title.  The arguments are the same as for EC.  TB uses
              the number register Tb as a counter.  The string Lt controls
              the title of the List of Tables; default value is ‘LIST OF
              TABLES’.  The List of Tables is only printed if number
              register Lt is 1, which is the default.  The string Litb
              contains the word ‘TABLE’, which is printed before the number.
              Special handling of the title occurs if TB is used inside
              DS/DE, it is not affected by the format of DS.
       TC [slevel [spacing [tlevel [tab [h1 [h2 [h3 [h4 [h5]]]]]]]]]
              Table of contents.  This macro is normally used as the last
              line of the document.  It generates a table of contents with
              headings up to the level controlled by number register Cl.
              Note that Cl controls the saving of headings, it has nothing
              to do with TC.  Headings with a level less than or equal to
              slevel get spacing number of lines before them.  Headings with
              a level less than or equal to tlevel have their page numbers
              right-justified with dots or spaces separating the text and
              the page number.  Spaces are used if tab is greater than zero,
              dots otherwise.  Other headings have the page number directly
              at the end of the heading text (ragged-right).
              The rest of the arguments is printed, centered, before the
              table of contents.
              The user-defined macros TX and TY are used if TC is called
              with at most four arguments.  TX is called before the printing
              of the string ‘CONTENTS’, and TY is called instead of printing
              ‘CONTENTS’.
              Equivalent macros can be defined for list of figures, tables,
              equations and exhibits by defining TXxx or TYxx, where xx is
              ‘Fg’, ‘TB’, ‘EC’, or ‘EX’, respectively.
              String Ci can be set to control the indentations for each
              heading-level.  It must be scaled, like
                     .ds Ci .25i .5i .75i 1i 1i
              By default, the indentation is controlled by the maximum
              length of headings in each level.
              The string variables Lifg, Litb, Liex, Liec, and Licon contain
              ‘Figure’, ‘TABLE’, ‘Exhibit’, ‘Equation’, and ‘CONTENTS’,
              respectively.  These can be redefined to other languages.
       TE     Table end.  See TS.
       TH [N] Table header.  See TS.  TH ends the header of the table.  This
              header is printed again if a page break occurs.  Argument ‘N’
              isn't implemented yet.
       TL [charging-case-number [filing-case-number]]
              Begin title of memorandum.  All text up to the next AU is
              included in the title.  charging-case-number and filing-case-
              number are saved for use in the front page processing.
       TM [num1 [num2 [...]]]
              Technical memorandum numbers used in .MT.  An unlimited number
              of arguments may be given.
       TP     Top-of-page user-defined macro.  This macro is called instead
              of the normal page header.  It is possible to get complete
              control over the header.  Note that the header and the footer
              are printed in a separate environment.  Line length is
              preserved, though.  See EOP.
              strings available to TP
              TPh    argument of PH
              TPeh   argument of EH
              TPoh   argument of OH
       TS [H] Table start.  This is the start of a table specification to
              tbl(1).  TS ends with TE.  Argument ‘H’ tells mm that the
              table has a header.  See TH.
       TX     User-defined table of contents exit.  This macro is called
              just before TC prints the word ‘CONTENTS’.  See TC.
       TY     User-defined table of contents exit.  This macro is called
              instead of printing ‘CONTENTS’.  See TC.
       VERBON [flag [point-size [font]]]
              Begin verbatim output using Courier font.  Usually for
              printing programs.  All characters have equal width.  The
              point size can be changed with the second argument.  By
              specifying a third argument it is possible to use another font
              instead of Courier.  flag controls several special features.
              Its value is the sum of all wanted features.
                     Arg   Description
                     1     Disable the escape character (\).  This is
                           normally turned on during verbose output.
                     2     Add an empty line before the verbose text.
                     4     Add an empty line after the verbose text.
                     8     Print the verbose text with numbered lines.  This
                           adds four digit-sized spaces in the beginning of
                           each line.  Finer control is available with the
                           string variable Verbnm.  It contains all
                           arguments to the troff(1) command .nm, normally
                           ‘1’.
                     16    Indent the verbose text by ‘5n’.  This is
                           controlled by the number-variable Verbin (in
                           units).
       VERBOFF
              End verbatim output.
       VL text-indent [mark-indent [1]]
              Variable-item list.  It has no fixed mark, it assumes that
              every LI has a mark instead.  text-indent sets the indent to
              the text, and mark-indent the distance from the current
              indentation to the mark.  A third argument prohibits printing
              of a blank line before each item.
       VM [-T] [top [bottom]]
              Vertical margin.  Increase the top and bottom margin by top
              and bottom, respectively.  If option -T is specified, set
              those margins to top and bottom.  If no argument is given,
              reset the margin to zero, or to the default (‘7v 5v’) if -T is
              used.  It is highly recommended that macros TP and/or EOP are
              defined if using -T and setting top and/or bottom margin to
              less than the default.
       WA [writer-name [title]]
              Begin specification of the writer and writer's address.
              Several names can be specified with empty WA/WE pairs, but
              only one address.
       WE     End the address specification after .WA.
       WC [format1] [format2] [...]
              Footnote and display width control.
              N     Set default mode which is equal to using the options
                    -WF, -FF, -WD, and FB.
              WF    Wide footnotes, wide also in two-column mode.
              -WF   Normal footnote width, follow column mode.

                    encountered.
              -FF   Normal footnotes, width follows WF and -WF.
              WD    Wide displays, wide also in two-column mode.
              -WD   Normal display width, follow column mode.
              FB    Floating displays generates a line break when printed on
                    the current page.
              -FB   Floating displays does not generate line break.
