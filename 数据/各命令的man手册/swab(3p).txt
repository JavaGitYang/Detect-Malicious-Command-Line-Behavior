       The swab() function shall copy nbytes bytes, which are pointed to by
       src, to the object pointed to by dest, exchanging adjacent bytes. The
       nbytes argument should be even. If nbytes is odd, swab() copies and
       exchanges nbytesâˆ’1 bytes and the disposition of the last byte is
       unspecified. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
       behavior is undefined.  If nbytes is negative, swab() does nothing.
