       findmnt will list all mounted filesystems or search for a filesystem.
       The findmnt command is able to search in /etc/fstab, /etc/mtab or
       /proc/self/mountinfo.  If device or mountpoint is not given, all
       filesystems are shown.
       The device may be specified by device name, major:minor numbers,
       filesystem label or UUID, or partition label or UUID.  Note that
       findmnt follows mount(8) behavior where a device name may be
       interpreted as a mountpoint (and vice versa) if the --target,
       --mountpoint or --source options are not specified.
       The command prints all mounted filesystems in the tree-like format by
       default.
