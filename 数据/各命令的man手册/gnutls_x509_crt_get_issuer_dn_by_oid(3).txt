       This function will extract the part of the name of the Certificate
       issuer specified by the given OID. The output, if the raw flag is not
       used, will be encoded as described in RFC4514. Thus a string that is
       ASCII or UTF-8 encoded, depending on the certificate data.
       Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h If
       raw flag is (0), this function will only return known OIDs as text.
       Other OIDs will be DER encoded, as described in RFC4514 -- in hex
       format with a '#' prefix.  You can check about known OIDs using
       gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known().
       If  buf is null then only the size will be filled. If the  raw_flag
       is not specified the output is always null terminated, although the
        buf_size will not include the null character.
