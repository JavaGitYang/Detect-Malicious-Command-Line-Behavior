       The renice utility shall request that the nice values (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 3.240, Nice Value) of one
       or more running processes be changed. By default, the applicable
       processes are specified by their process IDs. When a process group is
       specified (see −g), the request shall apply to all processes in the
       process group.
       The nice value shall be bounded in an implementation-defined manner.
       If the requested increment would raise or lower the nice value of the
       executed utility beyond implementation-defined limits, then the limit
       whose value was exceeded shall be used.
       When a user is reniced, the request applies to all processes whose
       saved set-user-ID matches the user ID corresponding to the user.
       Regardless of which options are supplied or any other factor, renice
       shall not alter the nice values of any process unless the user
       requesting such a change has appropriate privileges to do so for the
       specified process. If the user lacks appropriate privileges to
       perform the requested action, the utility shall return an error
       status.
       The saved set-user-ID of the user's process shall be checked instead
       of its effective user ID when renice attempts to determine the user
       ID of the process in order to determine whether the user has
       appropriate privileges.
