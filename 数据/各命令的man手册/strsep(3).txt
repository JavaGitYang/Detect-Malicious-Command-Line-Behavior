       If *stringp is NULL, the strsep() function returns NULL and does
       nothing else.  Otherwise, this function finds the first token in the
       string *stringp, that is delimited by one of the bytes in the string
       delim.  This token is terminated by overwriting the delimiter with a
       null byte ('\0'), and *stringp is updated to point past the token.
       In case no delimiter was found, the token is taken to be the entire
       string *stringp, and *stringp is made NULL.
