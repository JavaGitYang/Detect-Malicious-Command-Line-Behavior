       -P, --prompt
              outputs data in a format suitable for a prompt
       -C, --color

       -m, --mls-range
              show the sensitivity level and clearance, as a range, of the
              security context
       -R, --raw
              outputs  the sensitivity level and clearance in an
              untranslated format.
       -f, --file
              gets the context from the specified file FILE
       -L, --link
              gets the context from the specified file FILE (doesn't follow
              symlinks)
       -p, --pid
              gets the context from the specified process PID
       --pid-exec
              gets the exec context from the specified process PID
       --pid-fs
              gets the fscreate context from the specified process PID
       --pid-key
              gets the key context from the specified process PID
       --current, --self
              gets the context from the current process
       --current-exec, --self-exec
              gets the exec context from the current process
       --current-fs, --self-fs
              gets the fscreate context from the current process
       --current-key, --self-key
              gets the key context from the current process
       --parent
              gets the context from the parent of the current process
       --parent-exec
              gets the exec context from the parent of the current process
       --parent-fs
              gets the fscreate context from the parent of the current
              process
       --parent-key
              gets the key context from the parent of the current process
       Additional argument CONTEXT may be provided and will be used if no
       options have been specified to make secon get its context from
       another source.  If that argument is - then the context will be read
       from stdin.
       If there is no argument, secon will try reading a context from stdin,
       if that is not a tty, otherwise secon will act as though --self had
       been passed.
       If none of --user, --role, --type, --level or --mls-range is passed.
       Then all of them will be output.
