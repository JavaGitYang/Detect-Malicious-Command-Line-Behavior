       yum-config-manager is a program that can manage main yum
       configuration options, toggle which repositories are enabled or
       disabled, and add new repositories.
       Unless --add-repo is used, the program will output the current
       configuration of the selected sections, and optionally save it back
       to the corresponding files.
       By default, if no positional arguments are specified, the program
       will select the [main] section and each enabled repository.  You can
       override this by specifying your own list of sections as arguments
       (these may also include disabled repositories).  A section can either
       be main or a repoid.
