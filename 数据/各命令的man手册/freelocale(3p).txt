       The freelocale() function shall cause the resources allocated for a
       locale object returned by a call to the newlocale() or duplocale()
       functions to be released.
       The behavior is undefined if the locobj argument is the special
       locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale object
       handle.
       Any use of a locale object that has been freed results in undefined
       behavior.
