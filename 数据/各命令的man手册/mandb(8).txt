       mandb is used to initialise or manually update index database caches
       that are usually maintained by man.  The caches contain information
       relevant to the current state of the manual page system and the
       information stored within them is used by the man-db utilities to
       enhance their speed and functionality.
       When creating or updating an index, mandb will warn of bad ROFF .so
       requests, bogus manual page filenames and manual pages from which the
       whatis cannot be parsed.
       Supplying mandb with an optional colon-delimited path will override
       the internal system manual page hierarchy search path, determined
       from information found within the man-db configuration file.
