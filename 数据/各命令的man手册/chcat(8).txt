       Change/Remove the security category for each file or user.
       Use +/- to add/remove categories from a file or user.
       Note: When removing a category you must specify '--' on the command
       line before using the -Category syntax.  This tells the command that
       you have finished entering options and are now specifying a category
       name instead.
       -d     delete the category from each FILE/USER.
       -L     list available categories.
       -l     Tells chcat to operate on users instead of files.
