       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiWrite forces accumulated data values out to the PCP
       archive.
       The data values and associated metadata have previously been built up
       using calls to pmiAddMetric(3), pmiAddInstance(3), pmiPutValue(3) and
       pmiPutValueHandle(3).
       The current set of data values and any new metadata is written to the
       archive with a timestamp of sec and usec in the source timezone of
       the archive, see pmiSetTimezone(3).
