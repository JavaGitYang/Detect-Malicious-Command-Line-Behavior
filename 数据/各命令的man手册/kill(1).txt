       The command kill sends the specified signal to the specified
       processes or process groups.
       If no signal is specified, the TERM signal is sent.  The default
       action for this signal is to terminate the process.  This signal
       should be used in preference to the KILL signal (number 9), since a
       process may install a handler for the TERM signal in order to perform
       clean-up steps before terminating in an orderly fashion.  If a
       process does not terminate after a TERM signal has been sent, then
       the KILL signal may be used; be aware that the latter signal cannot
       be caught, and so does not give the target process the opportunity to
       perform any clean-up before terminating.
       Most modern shells have a builtin kill command, with a usage rather
       similar to that of the command described here.  The --all, --pid, and
       --queue options, and the possibility to specify processes by command
       name, are local extensions.
       If signal is 0, then no actual signal is sent, but error checking is
       still performed.
