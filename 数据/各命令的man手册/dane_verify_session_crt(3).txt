       This function will verify session's certificate chain against the CA
       constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE.  See
       dane_verify_crt() for more information.
       This will not verify the chain for validity; unless the DANE
       verification is restricted to end certificates, this must be be
       performed separately using gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3().
