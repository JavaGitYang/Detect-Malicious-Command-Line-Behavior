       nss-systemd is a plug-in module for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS)
       functionality of the GNU C Library (glibc), providing UNIX user and
       group name resolution for dynamic users and groups allocated through
       the DynamicUser= option in systemd unit files. See systemd.exec(5)
       for details on this option.
       This module also ensures that the root and nobody users and groups
       (i.e. the users/groups with the UIDs/GIDs 0 and 65534) remain
       resolvable at all times, even if they aren't listed in /etc/passwd or
       /etc/group, or if these files are missing.
       To activate the NSS module, add "systemd" to the lines starting with
       "passwd:" and "group:" in /etc/nsswitch.conf.
       It is recommended to place "systemd" after the "files" or "compat"
       entry of the /etc/nsswitch.conf lines so that /etc/passwd and
       /etc/group based mappings take precedence.
