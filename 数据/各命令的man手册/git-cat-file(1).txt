       In its first form, the command provides the content or the type of an
       object in the repository. The type is required unless -t or -p is
       used to find the object type, or -s is used to find the object size,
       or --textconv or --filters is used (which imply type "blob").
       In the second form, a list of objects (separated by linefeeds) is
       provided on stdin, and the SHA-1, type, and size of each object is
       printed on stdout. The output format can be overridden using the
       optional <format> argument. If either --textconv or --filters was
       specified, the input is expected to list the object names followed by
       the path name, separated by a single white space, so that the
       appropriate drivers can be determined.
