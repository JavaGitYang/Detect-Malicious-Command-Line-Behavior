       This family of functions is used to do low-level port input and
       output.  The out* functions do port output, the in* functions do port
       input; the b-suffix functions are byte-width and the w-suffix
       functions word-width; the _p-suffix functions pause until the I/O
       completes.
       They are primarily designed for internal kernel use, but can be used
       from user space.
       You must compile with -O or -O2 or similar.  The functions are
       defined as inline macros, and will not be substituted in without
       optimization enabled, causing unresolved references at link time.
       You use ioperm(2) or alternatively iopl(2) to tell the kernel to
       allow the user space application to access the I/O ports in question.
       Failure to do this will cause the application to receive a
       segmentation fault.
