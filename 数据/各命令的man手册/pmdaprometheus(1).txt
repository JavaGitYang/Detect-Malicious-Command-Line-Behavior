       pmdaprometheus is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       creates PCP metrics from Prometheus endpoints, which provide HTTP
       based access to application metrics.  The default config directory is
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/config.d/, see ``CONFIGURATION SOURCES''
       below.  The default URL fetch timeout is 2 seconds.  The default
       user, if not specified with the -u option, is the current user.  If
       the -n option is given, the list of configuration files will not be
       sorted prior to processing.  This list is sorted by default but that
       can be expensive if there are a large number of configuration files
       (URLs and/or scripts).
       If the -D option is given, additional diagnostic messages will be
       written to the PMDA log file, which is
       $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/prometheus.log by default.  In addition, the metric
       prometheus.control.debug controls the same debug flag and can be set
       with the following command:
            pmstore prometheus.control.debug value
       where value is either 1 (to enable verbose log messages) or 0 (to
       disable verbose log messages).  This is particularly useful for
       examining the http headers passed to each fetch request, filter
       settings and other processing details that are logged when the
       debugging flag is enabled.
