     The acl_set_permset() function sets the permission set of the ACL entry
     indicated by the argument entry_d to the permissions contained in the
     argument permset_d.
     Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to the entry containing the per‐
     mission set referred to by permset_d shall continue to refer to those
     entries. Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to the entry referred to
     by entry_d shall continue to refer to that entry.
