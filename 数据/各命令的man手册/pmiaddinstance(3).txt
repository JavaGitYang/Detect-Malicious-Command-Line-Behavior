       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiAddInstance adds a new element to the instance
       domain identified by indom.
       indom would normally be constructed using the pmInDom_build macro,
       e.g. pmInDom_build(PMI_DOMAIN,0) for the first instance domain in the
       Performance Metrics Domain PMI_DOMAIN (which is the default for all
       meta data created by the LOGIMPORT library).
       The new instance must have both an external name (instance) and an
       internal instance identifier (inst) that is unique across all
       instances in the indom instance domain.  There is a special
       ``uniqueness rule'' for instance that is imposed by pmLookupInDom(3),
       namely that the external instance name must be unique in the leading
       non-space characters, e.g. the instance names ``foo'' and ``foo bar''
       are considered the same by this rule and not allowed in the same
       instance domain, but ``foo'' and ``foobar'' would be allowed.
       Once defined, the external instance name can be used in calls to
       pmiGetHandle(3) and/or pmiPutValue(3) with the name of a metric
       defined over the same instance domain.
