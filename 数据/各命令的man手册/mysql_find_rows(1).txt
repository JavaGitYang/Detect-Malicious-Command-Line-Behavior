       mysql_find_rows reads files containing SQL statements and extracts
       statements that match a given regular expression or that contain USE
       db_name or SET statements. The utility was written for use with
       update log files (as used prior to MySQL 5.0) and as such expects
       statements to be terminated with semicolon (;) characters. It may be
       useful with other files that contain SQL statements as long as
       statements are terminated with semicolons.
       Invoke mysql_find_rows like this:
           shell> mysql_find_rows [options] [file_name ...]
       Each file_name argument should be the name of file containing SQL
       statements. If no file names are given, mysql_find_rows reads the
       standard input.
       Examples:
           mysql_find_rows --regexp=problem_table --rows=20 < update.log
           mysql_find_rows --regexp=problem_table  update-log.1 update-log.2
       mysql_find_rows supports the following options:
       ·   --help, --Information
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --regexp=pattern
           Display queries that match the pattern.
       ·   --rows=N
           Quit after displaying N queries.
       ·   --skip-use-db
           Do not include USE db_name statements in the output.
       ·   --start_row=N
           Start output from this row.
