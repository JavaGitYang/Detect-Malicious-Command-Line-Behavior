       The LTTng-UST tracef() API allows you to trace your application with
       the help of a simple printf(3)-like macro. The fmt argument is passed
       directly to the fmt parameter of vasprintf(3), as well as the
       optional parameters following fmt.
       To use tracef(), include <lttng/tracef.h> where you need it, and link
       your application with liblttng-ust. See the EXAMPLE section below for
       a complete usage example.
       Once your application is instrumented with tracef() calls and ready
       to run, use lttng-enable-event(1) to enable the lttng_ust_tracef:*
       event.
       The tracef() events contain a single field, named msg, which is the
       formatted string output.
       If you need to attach a specific log level to a tracef() call, use
       tracelog(3) instead.
       See also the LIMITATIONS section below for important limitations to
       consider when using tracef().
