       mtrace is a Perl script used to interpret and provide human readable
       output of the trace log contained in the file mtracedata, whose
       contents were produced by mtrace(3).  If binary is provided, the
       output of mtrace also contains the source file name with line number
       information for problem locations (assuming that binary was compiled
       with debugging information).
       For more information about the mtrace(3) function and mtrace script
       usage, see mtrace(3).
