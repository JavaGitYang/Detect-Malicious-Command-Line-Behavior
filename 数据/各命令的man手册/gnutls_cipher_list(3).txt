       Get a list of supported cipher algorithms.  Note that not necessarily
       all ciphers are supported as TLS cipher suites.  For example, DES is
       not supported as a cipher suite, but is supported for other purposes
       (e.g., PKCS8 or similar).
       This function is not thread safe.
