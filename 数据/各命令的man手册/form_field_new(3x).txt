       The function new_field allocates a new field and initializes it from
       the parameters given: height, width, row of upper-left corner, column
       of upper-left corner, number off-screen rows, and number of
       additional working buffers.
       The function dup_field duplicates a field at a new location.  Most
       attributes (including current contents, size, validation type, buffer
       count, growth threshold, justification, foreground, background, pad
       character, options, and user pointer) are copied.  Field status and
       the field page bit are not copied.
       The function link_field acts like dup_field, but the new field shares
       buffers with its parent.  Attribute data is separate.
       The function free_field de-allocates storage associated with a field.
