       wipefs can erase filesystem, raid or partition-table signatures
       (magic strings) from the specified device to make the signatures
       invisible for libblkid.  wipefs does not erase the filesystem itself
       nor any other data from the device.
       When used without any options, wipefs lists all visible filesystems
       and the offsets of their basic signatures.  The default output is
       subject to change.  So whenever possible, you should avoid using
       default outputs in your scripts.  Always explicitly define expected
       columns by using --output columns-list in environments where a stable
       output is required.
       wipefs calls the BLKRRPART ioctl when it has erased a partition-table
       signature to inform the kernel about the change.
       Note that some filesystems and some partition tables store more magic
       strings on the device (e.g. FAT, ZFS, GPT).  The wipefs command
       (since v2.31) lists all the offset where a magic strings have been
       detected.
       When option -a is used, all magic strings that are visible for
       libblkid are erased. In this case the wipefs scans the device again
       after each modification (erase) until no magic string is found.
       Note that by default wipefs does not erase nested partition tables on
       non-whole disk devices.  For this the option --force is required.
