       The pthread_setcancelstate() function shall atomically both set the
       calling thread's cancelability state to the indicated state and
       return the previous cancelability state at the location referenced by
       oldstate.  Legal values for state are PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_DISABLE.
       The pthread_setcanceltype() function shall atomically both set the
       calling thread's cancelability type to the indicated type and return
       the previous cancelability type at the location referenced by
       oldtype.  Legal values for type are PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED and
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_ASYNCHRONOUS.
       The cancelability state and type of any newly created threads,
       including the thread in which main() was first invoked, shall be
       PTHREAD_CANCEL_ENABLE and PTHREAD_CANCEL_DEFERRED respectively.
       The pthread_testcancel() function shall create a cancellation point
       in the calling thread. The pthread_testcancel() function shall have
       no effect if cancelability is disabled.
