       The library supports the Intel Haswell and Haswell-EP core PMU. It
       should be noted that this PMU model only covers each core's PMU and
       not the socket level PMU.
       On Haswell, the number of generic counters depends on the
       Hyperthreading (HT) mode.  When HT is on, then only 4 generic
       counters are available. When HT is off, then 8 generic counters are
       available. The pfm_get_pmu_info() function returns the maximum number
       of generic counters in num_cntrs.
