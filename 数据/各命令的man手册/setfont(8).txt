       The setfont command reads a font from the file font.new and loads it
       into the EGA/VGA character generator, and optionally outputs the
       previous font.  It can also load various mapping tables and output
       the previous versions.
       If no args are given (or only the option -N for some number N), then
       a default (8xN) font is loaded (see below).  One may give several
       small fonts, all containing a Unicode table, and setfont will combine
       them and load the union.  Typical use:
       setfont
              Load a default font.
       setfont drdos8x16
              Load a given font (here the 448-glyph drdos font).
       setfont cybercafe -u cybercafe
              Load a given font that does not have a Unicode map and provide
              one explicitly.
       setfont LatArCyrHeb-19 -m 8859-2
              Load a given font (here a 512-glyph font combining several
              character sets) and indicate that one's local character set is
              ISO 8859-2.
       Note: if a font has more than 256 glyphs, only 8 out of 16 colors can
       be used simultaneously. It can make console perception worse (loss of
       intensity and even some colors).
