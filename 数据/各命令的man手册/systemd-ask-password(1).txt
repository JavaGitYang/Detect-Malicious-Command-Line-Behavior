       systemd-ask-password may be used to query a system password or
       passphrase from the user, using a question message specified on the
       command line. When run from a TTY it will query a password on the TTY
       and print it to standard output. When run with no TTY or with
       --no-tty it will use the system-wide query mechanism, which allows
       active users to respond via several agents, listed below.
       The purpose of this tool is to query system-wide passwords — that is
       passwords not attached to a specific user account. Examples include:
       unlocking encrypted hard disks when they are plugged in or at boot,
       entering an SSL certificate passphrase for web and VPN servers.
       Existing agents are:
       ·   A boot-time password agent asking the user for passwords using
           plymouth(8),
       ·   A boot-time password agent querying the user directly on the
           console — systemd-ask-password-console.service(8),
       ·   An agent requesting password input via a wall(1) message —
           systemd-ask-password-wall.service(8),
       ·   A TTY agent that is temporarily spawned during systemctl(1)
           invocations,
       ·   A command line agent which can be started temporarily to process
           queued password requests — systemd-tty-ask-password-agent
           --query.
       Answering system-wide password queries is a privileged operation,
       hence all the agents listed above (except for the last one), run as
       privileged system services. The last one also needs elevated
       privileges, so should be run through sudo(8) or similar.
       Additional password agents may be implemented according to the
       systemd Password Agent Specification[1].
       If a password is queried on a TTY, the user may press TAB to hide the
       asterisks normally shown for each character typed. Pressing Backspace
       as first key achieves the same effect.
