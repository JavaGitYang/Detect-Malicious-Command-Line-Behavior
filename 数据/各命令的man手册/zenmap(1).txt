       Zenmap is a multi-platform graphical Nmap frontend and results
       viewer. Zenmap aims to make Nmap easy for beginners to use while
       giving experienced Nmap users advanced features. Frequently used
       scans can be saved as profiles to make them easy to run repeatedly. A
       command creator allows interactive creation of Nmap command lines.
       Scan results can be saved and viewed later. Saved scan results can be
       compared with one another to see how they differ. The results of
       recent scans are stored in a searchable database.
       This man page only describes the few Zenmap command-line options and
       some critical notes. A much more detailed Zenmap User's Guide is
       available at https://nmap.org/book/zenmap.html . Other documentation
       and information is available from the Zenmap web page at
       https://nmap.org/zenmap/ .
