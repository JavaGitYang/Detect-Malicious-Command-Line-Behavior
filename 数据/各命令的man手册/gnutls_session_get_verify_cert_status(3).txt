       This function returns the status of the verification when initiated
       via auto-verification, i.e., by gnutls_session_set_verify_cert2() or
       gnutls_session_set_verify_cert(). If no certificate verification was
       occurred then the return value would be set to ((unsigned int)-1).
       The certificate verification status is the same as in
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers().
