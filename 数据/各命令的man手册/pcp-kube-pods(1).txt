       pcp-kube-pods uses kubectl(1) to provide a list of IP addresses for
       PODs running in a local Kubenetes cluster, that may be running PCP
       services like pmcd(1) and pmproxy(1).
       It is used by the pmfind(1) command and the pmDiscoverServices(3) API
       as a ``shell'' command.
       The script invokes the kubectl get pod command line (see
       kubectl-get(1)) to discover IP addresses for pods.  The .status.podIP
       output field is extracted from the Kubernetes pod object(s).
       Additional options can be specified via configuration file, such as
       -l service=database to restrict the results using Kubernetes pod
       labels.  The default configuration file is
       $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/discover/pcp-kube-pods.conf
       If no local kubectl command is found, nothing is reported and an exit
       code indicating success is returned.
