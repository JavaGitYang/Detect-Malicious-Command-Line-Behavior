       The umount command detaches the mentioned file system(s) from the
       file hierarchy.  A file system is specified by giving the directory
       where it has been mounted.  Giving the special device on which the
       file system lives may also work, but is obsolete, mainly because it
       will fail in case this device was mounted on more than one directory.
       Note that a file system cannot be unmounted when it is 'busy' - for
       example, when there are open files on it, or when some process has
       its working directory there, or when a swap file on it is in use.
       The offending process could even be umount itself - it opens libc,
       and libc in its turn may open for example locale files.  A lazy
       unmount avoids this problem, but it may introduce another issues. See
       --lazy description bellow.
