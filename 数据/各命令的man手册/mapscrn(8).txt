       The mapscrn command is obsolete - its function is now built-in into
       setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still available
       as a separate command.
       The mapscrn command loads a user defined output character mapping
       table into the console driver. The console driver may be later put
       into use user-defined mapping table mode by outputting a special
       escape sequence to the console device.  This sequence is <esc>(K for
       the G0 character set and <esc>)K for the G1 character set.  When the
       -o option is given, the old map is saved in map.orig.
