       The lsmem command lists the ranges of available memory with their
       online status. The listed memory blocks correspond to the memory
       block representation in sysfs. The command also shows the memory
       block size and the amount of memory in online and offline state.
       The default output compatible with original implementation from
       s390-tools, but it's strongly recommended to avoid using default
       outputs in your scripts.  Always explicitly define expected columns
       by using the --output option together with a columns list in
       environments where a stable output is required.
       The lsmem command lists a new memory range always when the current
       memory block distinguish from the previous block by some output
       column.  This default behavior is possible to override by the --split
       option (e.g. lsmem --split=ZONES).  The special word "none" may be
       used to ignore all differences between memory blocks and to create as
       large as possible continuous ranges.  The opposite semantic is --all
       to list individual memory blocks.
       Note that some output columns may provide inaccurate information if a
       split policy forces lsmem to ignore differences in some attributes.
       For example if you merge removable and non-removable memory blocks to
       the one range than all the range will be marked as non-removable on
       lsmem output.
       Not all columns are supported on all systems.  If an unsupported
       column is specified, lsmem prints the column but does not provide any
       data for it.
       Use the --help option to see the columns description.
