       ausearch_add_regex adds one search condition based on a regular
       expression to the current audit search expression. The search
       conditions can then be used to scan logs, files, or buffers for
       something of interest. The regular expression follows the posix
       extended regular expression conventions, and is matched against the
       full record (without interpreting field values).
       If an existing search expression E is already defined, this function
       replaces it by (E && this_regexp).
