       OProfile is a profiling system for systems running Linux 2.6.31 and
       greater. OProfile makes use of the hardware performance counters
       provided on Intel, AMD, and other processors.  OProfile can profile a
       selected program or process or the whole system.  OProfile can also
       be used to collect cumulative event counts at the application,
       process, or system level.
       For a gentle guide to using OProfile, please read the HTML
       documentation listed in SEE ALSO.
