       Data written to the /dev/null and /dev/zero special files is
       discarded.
       Reads from /dev/null always return end of file (i.e., read(2) returns
       0), whereas reads from /dev/zero always return bytes containing zero
       ('\0' characters).
       These devices are typically created by:
           mknod -m 666 /dev/null c 1 3
           mknod -m 666 /dev/zero c 1 5
           chown root:root /dev/null /dev/zero
