       The join utility shall perform an equality join on the files file1
       and file2.  The joined files shall be written to the standard output.
       The join field is a field in each file on which the files are
       compared. The join utility shall write one line in the output for
       each pair of lines in file1 and file2 that have identical join
       fields. The output line by default shall consist of the join field,
       then the remaining fields from file1, then the remaining fields from
       file2.  This format can be changed by using the −o option (see
       below). The −a option can be used to add unmatched lines to the
       output. The −v option can be used to output only unmatched lines.
       The files file1 and file2 shall be ordered in the collating sequence
       of sort −b on the fields on which they shall be joined, by default
       the first in each line. All selected output shall be written in the
       same collating sequence.
       The default input field separators shall be <blank> characters. In
       this case, multiple separators shall count as one field separator,
       and leading separators shall be ignored. The default output field
       separator shall be a <space>.
       The field separator and collating sequence can be changed by using
       the −t option (see below).
       If the same key appears more than once in either file, all
       combinations of the set of remaining fields in file1 and the set of
       remaining fields in file2 are output in the order of the lines
       encountered.
       If the input files are not in the appropriate collating sequence, the
       results are unspecified.
