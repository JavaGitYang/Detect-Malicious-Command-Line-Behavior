       Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes
       data across networks from the command line. Ncat was written for the
       Nmap Project and is the culmination of the currently splintered
       family of Netcat incarnations. It is designed to be a reliable
       back-end tool to instantly provide network connectivity to other
       applications and users. Ncat will not only work with IPv4 and IPv6
       but provides the user with a virtually limitless number of potential
       uses.
       Among Ncat's vast number of features there is the ability to chain
       Ncats together; redirection of TCP, UDP, and SCTP ports to other
       sites; SSL support; and proxy connections via SOCKS4, SOCKS5 or HTTP
       proxies (with optional proxy authentication as well). Some general
       principles apply to most applications and thus give you the
       capability of instantly adding networking support to software that
       would normally never support it.
