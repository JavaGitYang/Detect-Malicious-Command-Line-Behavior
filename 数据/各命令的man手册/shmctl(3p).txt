       The shmctl() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.342, Shared Memory
       Object).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with
       the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The shmctl() function provides a variety of shared memory control
       operations as specified by cmd.  The following values for cmd are
       available:
       IPC_STAT    Place the current value of each member of the shmid_ds
                   data structure associated with shmid into the structure
                   pointed to by buf.  The contents of the structure are
                   defined in <sys/shm.h>.
       IPC_SET     Set the value of the following members of the shmid_ds
                   data structure associated with shmid to the corresponding
                   value found in the structure pointed to by buf:
                       shm_perm.uid
                       shm_perm.gid
                       shm_perm.mode    Low-order nine bits.
                   Also, the shm_ctime timestamp shall be set to the current
                   time, as described in Section 2.7.1, IPC General
                   Description.
                   IPC_SET can only be executed by a process that has an
                   effective user ID equal to either that of a process with
                   appropriate privileges or to the value of shm_perm.cuid
                   or shm_perm.uid in the shmid_ds data structure associated
                   with shmid.
       IPC_RMID    Remove the shared memory identifier specified by shmid
                   from the system and destroy the shared memory segment and
                   shmid_ds data structure associated with it. IPC_RMID can
                   only be executed by a process that has an effective user
                   ID equal to either that of a process with appropriate
                   privileges or to the value of shm_perm.cuid or
                   shm_perm.uid in the shmid_ds data structure associated
                   with shmid.
