       This module saves the last passwords for each user in order to force
       password change history and keep the user from alternating between
       the same password too frequently.
       This module does not work together with kerberos. In general, it does
       not make much sense to use this module in conjunction with NIS or
       LDAP, since the old passwords are stored on the local machine and are
       not available on another machine for password history checking.
