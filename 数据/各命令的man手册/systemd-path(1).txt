       systemd-path may be used to query system and user paths. The tool
       makes many of the paths described in file-hierarchy(7) available for
       querying.
       When invoked without arguments, a list of known paths and their
       current values is shown. When at least one argument is passed, the
       path with this name is queried and its value shown. The variables
       whose name begins with "search-" do not refer to individual paths,
       but instead to a list of colon-separated search paths, in their order
       of precedence.
