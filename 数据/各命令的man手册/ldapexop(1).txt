       ldapexop issues the LDAP extended operation specified by oid or one
       of the special keywords whoami, cancel, or refresh.
       Additional data for the extended operation can be passed to the
       server using data or base-64 encoded as b64data in the case of oid,
       or using the additional parameters in the case of the specially named
       extended operations above.
       Please note that ldapexop behaves differently for the same extended
       operation when it was given as an OID or as a specially named
       operation:
       Calling ldapexop with the OID of the whoami (RFC 4532) extended
       operation
         ldapexop [<options>] 1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.11.3
       yields
         # extended operation response
         data:: <base64 encoded response data>
       while calling it with the keyword whoami
         ldapexop [<options>] whoami
       results in
         dn:<client's identity>
