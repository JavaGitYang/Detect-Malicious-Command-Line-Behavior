       The kernel, the initial RAM disk (initrd) and basic userspace
       functionality may be configured at boot via kernel command line
       arguments.
       For command line parameters understood by the kernel, please see
       kernel-parameters.html[1] and bootparam(7).
       For command line parameters understood by the initial RAM disk,
       please see dracut.cmdline(7), or the documentation of the specific
       initrd implementation of your installation.
