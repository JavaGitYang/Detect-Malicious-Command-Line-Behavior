       The posix_trace_attr_destroy() function shall destroy an initialized
       trace attributes object.  A destroyed attr attributes object can be
       reinitialized using posix_trace_attr_init(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined.
       The posix_trace_attr_init() function shall initialize a trace
       attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       individual attributes used by a given implementation. The read-only
       generation-version and clock-resolution attributes of the newly
       initialized trace attributes object shall be set to their appropriate
       values (see Section 2.11.1.2, posix_trace_status_info Structure).
       Results are undefined if posix_trace_attr_init() is called specifying
       an already initialized attr attributes object.
       Implementations may add extensions to the trace attributes object
       structure as permitted in the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Chapter 2, Conformance.
       The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting
       individual attributes values), when used by posix_trace_create(),
       defines the attributes of the trace stream created. A single
       attributes object can be used in multiple calls to
       posix_trace_create().  After one or more trace streams have been
       created using an attributes object, any function affecting that
       attributes object, including destruction, shall not affect any trace
       stream previously created. An initialized attributes object also
       serves to receive the attributes of an existing trace stream or trace
       log when calling the posix_trace_get_attr() function.
