       sem_getvalue() places the current value of the semaphore pointed to
       sem into the integer pointed to by sval.
       If one or more processes or threads are blocked waiting to lock the
       semaphore with sem_wait(3), POSIX.1 permits two possibilities for the
       value returned in sval: either 0 is returned; or a negative number
       whose absolute value is the count of the number of processes and
       threads currently blocked in sem_wait(3).  Linux adopts the former
       behavior.
