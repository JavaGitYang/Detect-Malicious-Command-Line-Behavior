       pam_succeed_if.so is designed to succeed or fail authentication based
       on characteristics of the account belonging to the user being
       authenticated or values of other PAM items. One use is to select
       whether to load other modules based on this test.
       The module should be given one or more conditions as module
       arguments, and authentication will succeed only if all of the
       conditions are met.
