       TLS debug client. It sets up multiple TLS connections to a server and
       queries its capabilities. It was created to assist in debugging
       GnuTLS, but it might be useful to extract a TLS server's
       capabilities.  It connects to a TLS server, performs tests and print
       the server's capabilities. If called with the `-V' parameter more
       checks will be performed.  Can be used to check for servers with
       special needs or bugs.
