       For iswalnum(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The iswalnum() and iswalnum_l() functions shall test whether wc is a
       wide-character code representing a character of class alpha or digit
       in the current locale, or in the locale represented by locale,
       respectively; see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008,
       Chapter 7, Locale.
       The wc argument is a wint_t, the value of which the application shall
       ensure is a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in
       the current locale, or equal to the value of the macro WEOF. If the
       argument has any other value, the behavior is undefined.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to iswalnum_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
