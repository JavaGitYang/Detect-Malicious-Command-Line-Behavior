       The /etc/security/pam_env.conf file specifies the environment
       variables to be set, unset or modified by pam_env(8). When someone
       logs in, this file is read and the environment variables are set
       according.
       Each line starts with the variable name, there are then two possible
       options for each variable DEFAULT and OVERRIDE. DEFAULT allows and
       administrator to set the value of the variable to some default value,
       if none is supplied then the empty string is assumed. The OVERRIDE
       option tells pam_env that it should enter in its value (overriding
       the default value) if there is one to use. OVERRIDE is not used, ""
       is assumed and no override will be done.
       VARIABLE [DEFAULT=[value]] [OVERRIDE=[value]]
       (Possibly non-existent) environment variables may be used in values
       using the ${string} syntax and (possibly non-existent) PAM_ITEMs as
       well as HOME and SHELL may be used in values using the @{string}
       syntax. Both the $ and @ characters can be backslash escaped to be
       used as literal values values can be delimited with "", escaped " not
       supported. Note that many environment variables that you would like
       to use may not be set by the time the module is called. For example,
       ${HOME} is used below several times, but many PAM applications don't
       make it available by the time you need it. The special variables
       @{HOME} and @{SHELL} are expanded to the values for the user from his
       passwd entry.
       The "#" character at start of line (no space at front) can be used to
       mark this line as a comment line.
       The /etc/environment file specifies the environment variables to be
       set. The file must consist of simple NAME=VALUE pairs on separate
       lines. The pam_env(8) module will read the file after the
       pam_env.conf file.
