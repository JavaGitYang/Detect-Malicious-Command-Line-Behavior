       The lttng stop command stops the various LTTng tracers for a given
       active tracing session.
       Stopping the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event
       rules within enabled channels cannot make event sources emit trace
       events anymore.
       A tracing session with no running tracers is said to be inactive.
       Inactive tracing sessions can be set active using the lttng-start(1)
       command.
       If SESSION is omitted, the LTTng tracers are stopped for the current
       tracing session (see lttng-create(1) for more information about the
       current tracing session). Otherwise, they are stopped for the
       existing tracing session named SESSION. lttng list outputs all the
       existing tracing sessions (see lttng-list(1)).
       By default, the lttng stop command ensures that the tracing session’s
       trace data is valid before returning to the prompt. With the --no-
       wait option, the command finishes immediately, hence a local trace
       might not be valid when the command is done. In this case, there is
       no way to know when the trace becomes valid.
       If at least one rotation occurred during the chosen tracing session’s
       lifetime (see lttng-rotate(1) and lttng-enable-rotation(1)), the
       lttng stop command renames the current trace chunk subdirectory and
       prints the renamed path. Although it is safe to read the content of
       this renamed subdirectory while the tracing session remains inactive
       (until the next lttng-start(1)), it is NOT a trace chunk archive: you
       need to destroy the tracing session with lttng-destroy(1) or make a
       rotation with lttng-rotate(1) to archive it.
