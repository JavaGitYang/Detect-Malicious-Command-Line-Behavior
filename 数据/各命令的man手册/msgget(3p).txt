       The msgget() function operates on XSI message queues (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 3.225, Message Queue).
       It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with the
       realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The msgget() function shall return the message queue identifier
       associated with the argument key.
       A message queue identifier, associated message queue, and data
       structure (see <sys/msg.h>), shall be created for the argument key if
       one of the following is true:
        *  The argument key is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.
        *  The argument key does not already have a message queue identifier
           associated with it, and (msgflg & IPC_CREAT) is non-zero.
       Upon creation, the data structure associated with the new message
       queue identifier shall be initialized as follows:
        *  msg_perm.cuid, msg_perm.uid, msg_perm.cgid, and msg_perm.gid
           shall be set to the effective user ID and effective group ID,
           respectively, of the calling process.
        *  The low-order 9 bits of msg_perm.mode shall be set to the low-
           order 9 bits of msgflg.
        *  msg_qnum, msg_lspid, msg_lrpid, msg_stime, and msg_rtime shall be
           set to 0.
        *  msg_ctime shall be set to the current time, as described in
           Section 2.7.1, IPC General Description.
        *  msg_qbytes shall be set to the system limit.
