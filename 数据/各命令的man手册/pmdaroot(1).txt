       pmdaroot is a special Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       cooperates closely with pmcd(1) and other PMDAs to provide limited
       privileged services to these unprivileged processes.
       In this role it is used to discover operating system containers
       running on the local host.  It also enables access to performance
       data from within those containers by other PMDAs running on the bare-
       metal host, using the pmdaRootConnect(3) and the associated namespace
       interfaces.
       Like all other PMDAs, it also exports performance metrics from the
       domain it controls.  Currently, this is limited to information about
       the containers on the local system; currently Docker and LXC
       containers can be detected.
       If a non-default Docker parent-cgroup name is being used, this value
       can be indicated to pmdaroot through addition of a
       $PCP_SYSTEMD_CGROUP variable in /etc/pcp.conf.
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named root.log
            is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdaroot is
            started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
       -s   Location of the unix(7) domain socket for communication with
            clients seeking privileged operations.  By default, a socket
            file named $PCP_TMP_DIR/pmcd/root.socket is used.
