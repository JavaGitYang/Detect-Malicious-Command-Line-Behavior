       The io_setup() system call creates an asynchronous I/O context
       suitable for concurrently processing nr_events operations.  The
       ctx_idp argument must not point to an AIO context that already
       exists, and must be initialized to 0 prior to the call.  On
       successful creation of the AIO context, *ctx_idp is filled in with
       the resulting handle.
