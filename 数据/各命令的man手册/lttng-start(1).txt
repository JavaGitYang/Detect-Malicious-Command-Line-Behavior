       The lttng start command starts the various LTTng tracers for a given
       inactive tracing session.
       Starting the LTTng tracers has the effect that all enabled event
       rules within enabled channels can make their target event sources
       emit trace events. Whether they are recorded to the local file
       system, sent over the network, or not recorded at all depends on the
       specific configuration of the tracing session in which tracing is
       started. See lttng-create(1) for different session modes.
       A tracing session with running tracers is said to be active. Active
       tracing sessions can return to the inactive state using the
       lttng-stop(1) command.
       If SESSION is omitted, the LTTng tracers are started for the current
       tracing session (see lttng-create(1) for more information about the
       current tracing session). Otherwise, they are started for the
       existing tracing session named SESSION. lttng list outputs all the
       existing tracing sessions (see lttng-list(1)).
