     The acl_add_perm() function adds the permission contained in the argu‐
     ment perm (one of ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE, ACL_EXECUTE) to the permission
     set referred to by the argument permset_d.  An attempt to add a permis‐
     sion that is already contained in the permission set is not considered
     an error.
     Any existing descriptors that refer to permset_d continue to refer to
     that permission set.
