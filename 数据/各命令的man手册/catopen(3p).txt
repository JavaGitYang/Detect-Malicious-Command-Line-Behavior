       The catopen() function shall open a message catalog and return a
       message catalog descriptor. The name argument specifies the name of
       the message catalog to be opened. If name contains a '/', then name
       specifies a complete name for the message catalog. Otherwise, the
       environment variable NLSPATH is used with name substituted for the %N
       conversion specification (see the Base Definitions volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, Chapter 8, Environment Variables).  If NLSPATH exists
       in the environment when the process starts, then if the process has
       appropriate privileges, the behavior of catopen() is undefined. If
       NLSPATH does not exist in the environment, or if a message catalog
       cannot be found in any of the components specified by NLSPATH, then
       an implementation-defined default path shall be used. This default
       may be affected by the setting of LC_MESSAGES if the value of oflag
       is NL_CAT_LOCALE, or the LANG environment variable if oflag is 0.
       A message catalog descriptor shall remain valid in a process until
       that process closes it, or a successful call to one of the exec
       functions. A change in the setting of the LC_MESSAGES category may
       invalidate existing open catalogs.
       If a file descriptor is used to implement message catalog
       descriptors, the FD_CLOEXEC flag shall be set; see <fcntl.h>.
       If the value of the oflag argument is 0, the LANG environment
       variable is used to locate the catalog without regard to the
       LC_MESSAGES category. If the oflag argument is NL_CAT_LOCALE, the
       LC_MESSAGES category is used to locate the message catalog (see the
       Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 8.2,
       Internationalization Variables).
