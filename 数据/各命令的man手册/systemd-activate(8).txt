       systemd-activate can be used to launch a socket-activated daemon from
       the command line for testing purposes. It can also be used to launch
       single instances of the daemon per connection (inetd-style).
       The daemon to launch and its options should be specified after
       options intended for systemd-activate.
       If the -a option is given, file descriptor of the connection will be
       used as the standard input and output of the launched process.
       Otherwise, standard input and output will be inherited, and sockets
       will be passed through file descriptors 3 and higher. Sockets passed
       through $LISTEN_FDS to systemd-activate will be passed through to the
       daemon, in the original positions. Other sockets specified with
       --listen will use consecutive descriptors.
