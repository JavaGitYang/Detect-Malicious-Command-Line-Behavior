       Several applications need sine and cosine of the same angle x.  These
       functions compute both at the same time, and store the results in
       *sin and *cos.  Using this function can be more efficient than two
       separate calls to sin(3) and cos(3).
       If x is a NaN, a NaN is returned in *sin and *cos.
       If x is positive infinity or negative infinity, a domain error
       occurs, and a NaN is returned in *sin and *cos.
