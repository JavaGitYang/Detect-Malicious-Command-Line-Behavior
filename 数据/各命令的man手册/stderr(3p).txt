       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       A file with associated buffering is called a stream and is declared
       to be a pointer to a defined type FILE.  The fopen() function shall
       create certain descriptive data for a stream and return a pointer to
       designate the stream in all further transactions. Normally, there are
       three open streams with constant pointers declared in the <stdio.h>
       header and associated with the standard open files.
       At program start-up, three streams shall be predefined and need not
       be opened explicitly: standard input (for reading conventional
       input), standard output (for writing conventional output), and
       standard error (for writing diagnostic output). When opened, the
       standard error stream is not fully buffered; the standard input and
       standard output streams are fully buffered if and only if the stream
       can be determined not to refer to an interactive device.
       The following symbolic values in <unistd.h> define the file
       descriptors that shall be associated with the C-language stdin,
       stdout, and stderr when the application is started:
       STDIN_FILENO  Standard input value, stdin.  Its value is 0.
       STDOUT_FILENO Standard output value, stdout.  Its value is 1.
       STDERR_FILENO Standard error value, stderr.  Its value is 2.
       The stderr stream is expected to be open for reading and writing.
