       The clock_getcpuclockid() function shall return the clock ID of the
       CPU-time clock of the process specified by pid.  If the process
       described by pid exists and the calling process has permission, the
       clock ID of this clock shall be returned in clock_id.
       If pid is zero, the clock_getcpuclockid() function shall return the
       clock ID of the CPU-time clock of the process making the call, in
       clock_id.
       The conditions under which one process has permission to obtain the
       CPU-time clock ID of other processes are implementation-defined.
