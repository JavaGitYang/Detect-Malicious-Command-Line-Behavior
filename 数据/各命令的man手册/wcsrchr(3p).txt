       The wcsrchr() function shall locate the last occurrence of wc in the
       wide-character string pointed to by ws.  The application shall ensure
       that the value of wc is a character representable as a type wchar_t
       and a wide-character code corresponding to a valid character in the
       current locale. The terminating null wide-character code shall be
       considered to be part of the wide-character string.
