       systemd-tmpfiles uses the configuration files from the above
       directories to describe the creation, cleaning and removal of
       volatile and temporary files and directories which usually reside in
       directories such as /run or /tmp.
       Volatile and temporary files and directories are those located in
       /run (and its alias /var/run), /tmp, /var/tmp, the API file systems
       such as /sys or /proc, as well as some other directories below /var.
       System daemons frequently require private runtime directories below
       /run to place communication sockets and similar in. For these,
       consider declaring them in their unit files using RuntimeDirectory=
       (see systemd.exec(5) for details), if this is feasible.
