       @CLEAR@ clears your screen if this is possible, including its
       scrollback buffer (if the extended “E3” capability is defined).
       @CLEAR@ looks in the environment for the terminal type given by the
       environment variable TERM, and then in the terminfo database to
       determine how to clear the screen.
       @CLEAR@ writes to the standard output.  You can redirect the standard
       output to a file (which prevents @CLEAR@ from actually clearing the
       screen), and later cat the file to the screen, clearing it at that
       point.
