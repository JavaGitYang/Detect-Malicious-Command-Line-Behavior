       indxbib makes an inverted index for the bibliographic databases in
       filename...  for use with refer(1), lookbib(1), and lkbib(1).  The
       index will be named filename.i; the index is written to a temporary
       file which is then renamed to this.  If no filenames are given on the
       command line because the -f option has been used, and no -o option is
       given, the index will be named Ind.i.
       Bibliographic databases are divided into records by blank lines.
       Within a record, each fields starts with a % character at the
       beginning of a line.  Fields have a one letter name which follows the
       % character.
       The values set by the -c, -n, -l and -t options are stored in the
       index; when the index is searched, keys will be discarded and
       truncated in a manner appropriate to these options; the original keys
       will be used for verifying that any record found using the index
       actually contains the keys.  This means that a user of an index need
       not know whether these options were used in the creation of the
       index, provided that not all the keys to be searched for would have
       been discarded during indexing and that the user supplies at least
       the part of each key that would have remained after being truncated
       during indexing.  The value set by the -i option is also stored in
       the index and will be used in verifying records found using the
       index.
