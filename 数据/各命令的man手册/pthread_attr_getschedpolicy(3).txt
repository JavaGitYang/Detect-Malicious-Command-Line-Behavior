       The pthread_attr_setschedpolicy() function sets the scheduling policy
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in policy.  This attribute determines the scheduling
       policy of a thread created using the thread attributes object attr.
       The supported values for policy are SCHED_FIFO, SCHED_RR, and
       SCHED_OTHER, with the semantics described in sched(7).
       The pthread_attr_getschedpolicy() returns the scheduling policy
       attribute of the thread attributes object attr in the buffer pointed
       to by policy.
       In order for the policy setting made by pthread_attr_setschedpolicy()
       to have effect when calling pthread_create(3), the caller must use
       pthread_attr_setinheritsched(3) to set the inherit-scheduler
       attribute of the attributes object attr to PTHREAD_EXPLICIT_SCHED.
