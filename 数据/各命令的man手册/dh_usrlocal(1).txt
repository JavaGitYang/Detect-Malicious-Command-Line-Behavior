       dh_usrlocal is a debhelper program that can be used for building
       packages that will provide a subdirectory in /usr/local when
       installed.
       It finds subdirectories of usr/local in the package build directory,
       and removes them, replacing them with maintainer script snippets
       (unless -n is used) to create the directories at install time, and
       remove them when the package is removed, in a manner compliant with
       Debian policy. These snippets are inserted into the maintainer
       scripts by dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of
       debhelper maintainer script snippets.
       When the Rules-Requires-Root field is not (effectively) binary-
       targets, the directories in /usr/local will have ownership root:staff
       and the mode will be 02775.  These values have been chosen to comply
       with the recommendations of the Debian policy for directories in
       /usr/local.
       When Rules-Requires-Root has an effective value of binary-targets,
       the owners, groups and permissions will be preserved with one
       exception.  If the directory is owned by root:root, then ownership
       will be reset to root:staff and mode will be reset to 02775. This is
       useful, since that is the group and mode policy recommends for
       directories in /usr/local.
