       Bash is an sh-compatible command language interpreter that executes
       commands read from the standard input or from a file.  Bash also
       incorporates useful features from the Korn and C shells (ksh and
       csh).
       Bash is intended to be a conformant implementation of the Shell and
       Utilities portion of the IEEE POSIX specification (IEEE Standard
       1003.1).  Bash can be configured to be POSIX-conformant by default.
