       The setkeycodes command reads its arguments two at a time, each pair
       of arguments consisting of a scancode (given in hexadecimal) and a
       keycode (given in decimal). For each such pair, it tells the kernel
       keyboard driver to map the specified scancode to the specified
       keycode.
       This command is useful only for people with slightly unusual
       keyboards, that have a few keys which produce scancodes that the
       kernel does not recognize.
