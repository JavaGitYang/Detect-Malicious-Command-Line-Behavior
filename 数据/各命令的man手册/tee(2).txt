       tee() duplicates up to len bytes of data from the pipe referred to by
       the file descriptor fd_in to the pipe referred to by the file
       descriptor fd_out.  It does not consume the data that is duplicated
       from fd_in; therefore, that data can be copied by a subsequent
       splice(2).
       flags is a bit mask that is composed by ORing together zero or more
       of the following values:
       SPLICE_F_MOVE      Currently has no effect for tee(); see splice(2).
       SPLICE_F_NONBLOCK  Do not block on I/O; see splice(2) for further
                          details.
       SPLICE_F_MORE      Currently has no effect for tee(), but may be
                          implemented in the future; see splice(2).
       SPLICE_F_GIFT      Unused for tee(); see vmsplice(2).
