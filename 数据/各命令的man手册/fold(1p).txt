       The fold utility is a filter that shall fold lines from its input
       files, breaking the lines to have a maximum of width column positions
       (or bytes, if the −b option is specified). Lines shall be broken by
       the insertion of a <newline> such that each output line (referred to
       later in this section as a segment) is the maximum width possible
       that does not exceed the specified number of column positions (or
       bytes). A line shall not be broken in the middle of a character. The
       behavior is undefined if width is less than the number of columns any
       single character in the input would occupy.
       If the <carriage-return>, <backspace>, or <tab> characters are
       encountered in the input, and the −b option is not specified, they
       shall be treated specially:
       <backspace>
                 The current count of line width shall be decremented by
                 one, although the count never shall become negative. The
                 fold utility shall not insert a <newline> immediately
                 before or after any <backspace>, unless the following
                 character has a width greater than 1 and would cause the
                 line width to exceed width.
       <carriage-return>
                 The current count of line width shall be set to zero. The
                 fold utility shall not insert a <newline> immediately
                 before or after any <carriage-return>.
       <tab>     Each <tab> encountered shall advance the column position
                 pointer to the next tab stop. Tab stops shall be at each
                 column position n such that n modulo 8 equals 1.
