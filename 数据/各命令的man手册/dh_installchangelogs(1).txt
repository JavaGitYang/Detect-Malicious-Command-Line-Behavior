       dh_installchangelogs is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing changelogs into package build directories.
       An upstream changelog file may be specified as an option. If none is
       specified, it looks for files with names that seem likely to be
       changelogs.  (In compatibility level 7 and above.)
       If there is an upstream changelog file, it will be installed as
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog in the package build directory.
       If the upstream changelog is an html file (determined by file
       extension), it will be installed as
       usr/share/doc/package/changelog.html instead. If the html changelog
       is converted to plain text, that variant can be specified as a second
       upstream changelog file. When no plain text variant is specified, a
       short usr/share/doc/package/changelog is generated, pointing readers
       at the html changelog file.
