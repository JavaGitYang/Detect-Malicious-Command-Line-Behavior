       login is used when signing onto a system.  If no argument is given,
       login prompts for the username.
       The user is then prompted for a password, where appropriate.  Echoing
       is disabled to prevent revealing the password.  Only a small number
       of password failures are permitted before login exits and the
       communications link is severed.
       If password aging has been enabled for the account, the user may be
       prompted for a new password before proceeding.  He will be forced to
       provide his old password and the new password before continuing.
       Please refer to passwd(1) for more information.
       The user and group ID will be set according to their values in the
       /etc/passwd file.  There is one exception if the user ID is zero: in
       this case, only the primary group ID of the account is set.  This
       should allow the system administrator to login even in case of
       network problems.  The value for $HOME, $USER, $SHELL, $PATH,
       $LOGNAME, and $MAIL are set according to the appropriate fields in
       the password entry.  $PATH defaults to /usr/local/bin:/bin:/usr/bin
       for normal users, and to /usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/sbin:/bin:
       /usr/sbin:/usr/bin for root, if not otherwise configured.
       The environment variable $TERM will be preserved, if it exists (other
       environment variables are preserved if the -p option is given), else
       it will be initialized to the terminal type on your tty.
       Then the user's shell is started.  If no shell is specified for the
       user in /etc/passwd, then /bin/sh is used.  If there is no directory
       specified in /etc/passwd, then / is used (the home directory is
       checked for the .hushlogin file described below).
       If the file .hushlogin exists, then a "quiet" login is performed
       (this disables the checking of mail and the printing of the last
       login time and message of the day).  Otherwise, if /var/log/lastlog
       exists, the last login time is printed (and the current login is
       recorded).
