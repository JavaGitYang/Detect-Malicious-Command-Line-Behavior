       The resizecons command tries to change the videomode of the console.
       There are several aspects to this: (a) the kernel must know about it,
       (b) the hardware must know about it, (c) user programs must know
       about it, (d) the console font may have to be adapted.
       (a) The kernel is told about the change using the ioctl VT_RESIZE.
       This causes the kernel to reallocate console screen memory for all
       virtual consoles, and might fail if there is not enough memory.  (In
       that case, try to disallocate some virtual consoles first.)  If this
       ioctl succeeds, but a later step fails (e.g., because you do not have
       root permissions), you may be left with a very messy screen.
       The most difficult part of this is (b), since it requires detailed
       knowledge of the video card hardware, and the setting of numerous
       registers. Only changing the number of rows is slightly easier, and
       resizecons will try to do that itself, when given the -lines option.
       (Probably, root permission will be required.)  The command resizecons
       COLSxROWS will execute restoretextmode -r COLSxROWS (and hence
       requires that you have svgalib installed). Here COLSxROWS is a file
       that was created earlier by restoretextmode -w COLSxROWS.  Again,
       either root permissions are required, or restoretextmode has to be
       suid root.
       In order to deal with (c), resizecons does a `stty rows ROWS cols
       COLS' for each active console (in the range tty0..tty15), and sends a
       SIGWINCH signal to selection if it finds the file /tmp/selection.pid.
       Finally, (d) is dealt with by executing a setfont command. Most
       likely, the wrong font is loaded, and you may want to do another
       setfont yourself afterwards.
