       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiErrStr translates error codes returned from the
       other routines in the Log Import library into printable error
       messages.
       code would normally have a negative value.  As a special case, if
       code is -1 then the error code returned from the last routine called
       in the LOGIMPORT library for this context will be used.
       The pmiErrStr_r function does the same, but stores the result in a
       user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for
       at least PMI_MAXERRMSGLEN bytes.
       The set of possible error codes and messages is all those defined by
       pmErrStr(3) and PCPIntro(3), plus the additonal ones defined in
       <pcp/import.h> with error code names of the form PMI_ERR_....
