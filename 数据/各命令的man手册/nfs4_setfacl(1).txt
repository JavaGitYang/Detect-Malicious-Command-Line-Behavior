       nfs4_setfacl manipulates the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL) of one
       or more files (or directories), provided they are on a mounted NFSv4
       filesystem which supports ACLs.
       nfs4_editfacl is equivalent to nfs4_setfacl -e.
       Refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for information about NFSv4 ACL
       terminology and syntax.
   COMMANDS
       -a acl_spec [index]
              add the ACEs from acl_spec to file's ACL.  ACEs are inserted
              starting at the indexth position (DEFAULT: 1) of file's ACL.
       -A acl_file [index]
              add the ACEs from the acl_spec in acl_file to file's ACL.
              ACEs are inserted starting at the indexth position (DEFAULT:
              1) of file's ACL.
       -x acl_spec | index
              delete ACEs matched from acl_spec - or delete the indexth ACE
              - from file's ACL.  Note that the ordering of the ACEs in
              acl_spec does not matter.
       -X acl_file
              delete ACEs matched from the acl_spec in acl_file from file's
              ACL.  Note that the ordering of the ACEs in the acl_spec does
              not matter.
       -s acl_spec
              set file's ACL to acl_spec.
       -S acl_file
              set file's ACL to the acl_spec in acl_file.
       -e, --edit
              edit file's ACL in the editor defined in the EDITOR
              environment variable (DEFAULT: vi(1)) and set the resulting
              ACL upon a clean exit, assuming changes made in the editor
              were saved.  Note that if multiple files are specified, the
              editor will be serially invoked once per file.
       -m from_ace to_ace
              modify file's ACL in-place by replacing from_ace with to_ace.
       -?, -h, --help
              display help text and exit.
       --version
              display this program's version and exit.
       NOTE: if '-' is given as the acl_file with the -A/-X/-S flags, the
       acl_spec will be read from stdin.
   OPTIONS
       -R, --recursive
              recursively apply to a directory's files and subdirectories.
              Similar to setfacl(1), the default behavior is to follow
              symlinks given on the command line and to skip symlinks
              encountered while recursing through directories.
       -L, --logical
              in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a logical walk follows all
              symbolic links.
       -P, --physical
              in conjunction with -R/--recursive, a physical walk skips all
              symbolic links.
       --test
              display results of COMMAND, but do not save changes.
