       Note: these function are removed in glibc version 2.25.
       The malloc_get_state() function records the current state of all
       malloc(3) internal bookkeeping variables (but not the actual contents
       of the heap or the state of malloc_hook(3) functions pointers).  The
       state is recorded in a system-dependent opaque data structure
       dynamically allocated via malloc(3), and a pointer to that data
       structure is returned as the function result.  (It is the caller's
       responsibility to free(3) this memory.)
       The malloc_set_state() function restores the state of all malloc(3)
       internal bookkeeping variables to the values recorded in the opaque
       data structure pointed to by state.
