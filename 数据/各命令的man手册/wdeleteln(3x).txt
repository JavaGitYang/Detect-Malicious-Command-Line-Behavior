       The deleteln and wdeleteln routines delete the line under the cursor
       in the window; all lines below the current line are moved up one
       line.  The bottom line of the window is cleared.  The cursor position
       does not change.
       The insdelln and winsdelln routines, for positive n, insert n lines
       into the specified window above the current line.  The n bottom lines
       are lost.  For negative n, delete n lines (starting with the one
       under the cursor), and move the remaining lines up.  The bottom n
       lines are cleared.  The current cursor position remains the same.
       The insertln and winsertln routines insert a blank line above the
       current line and the bottom line is lost.
