       These functions shall compute a projection of z onto the Riemann
       sphere: z projects to z, except that all complex infinities (even
       those with one infinite part and one NaN part) project to positive
       infinity on the real axis. If z has an infinite part, then cproj(z)
       shall be equivalent to:
           INFINITY + I * copysign(0.0, cimag(z))
