       pg displays a text file on a CRT one screenful at once.  After each
       page, a prompt is displayed.  The user may then either press the
       newline key to view the next page or one of the keys described below.
       If no filename is given on the command line, pg reads from standard
       input.  If standard output is not a terminal, pg acts like cat(1) but
       precedes each file with its name if there is more than one.
       If input comes from a pipe, pg stores the data in a buffer file while
       reading, to make navigation possible.
