       If the process has appropriate privileges, setgid() shall set the
       real group ID, effective group ID, and the saved set-group-ID of the
       calling process to gid.
       If the process does not have appropriate privileges, but gid is equal
       to the real group ID or the saved set-group-ID, setgid() shall set
       the effective group ID to gid; the real group ID and saved set-group-
       ID shall remain unchanged.
       The setgid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list
       in any way.
       Any supplementary group IDs of the calling process shall remain
       unchanged.
