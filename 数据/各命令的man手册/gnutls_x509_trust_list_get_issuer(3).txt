       This function will find the issuer of the given certificate.  If the
       flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is specified a copy of the issuer will be
       returned which must be freed using gnutls_x509_crt_deinit().  In that
       case the provided  issuer must not be initialized.
       Note that the flag GNUTLS_TL_GET_COPY is required for this function
       to work with PKCS11 trust lists in a thread-safe way.
