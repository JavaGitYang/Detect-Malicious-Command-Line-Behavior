       The /etc/machine-info file contains machine metadata.
       The basic file format of machine-info is a newline-separated list of
       environment-like shell-compatible variable assignments. It is
       possible to source the configuration from shell scripts, however,
       beyond mere variable assignments no shell features are supported,
       allowing applications to read the file without implementing a shell
       compatible execution engine.
       /etc/machine-info contains metadata about the machine that is set by
       the user or administrator.
       Depending on the operating system other configuration files might be
       checked for machine information as well, however only as fallback.
       You may use hostnamectl(1) to change the settings of this file from
       the command line.
