       The <ftw.h> header shall define the FTW structure, which shall
       include at least the following members:
           int  base
           int  level
       The <ftw.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants for
       use as values of the third argument to the application-supplied
       function that is passed as the second argument to ftw() and nftw():
       FTW_F         Non-directory file.
       FTW_D         Directory.
       FTW_DNR       Directory without read permission.
       FTW_DP        Directory with subdirectories visited.
       FTW_NS        Unknown type; stat() failed.
       FTW_SL        Symbolic link.
       FTW_SLN       Symbolic link that names a nonexistent file.
       The <ftw.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants for
       use as values of the fourth argument to nftw():
       FTW_PHYS      Physical walk, does not follow symbolic links.
                     Otherwise, nftw() follows links but does not walk down
                     any path that crosses itself.
       FTW_MOUNT     The walk does not cross a mount point.
       FTW_DEPTH     All subdirectories are visited before the directory
                     itself.
       FTW_CHDIR     The walk changes to each directory before reading it.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int ftw(const char *, int (*)(const char *, const struct stat *,
               int), int);
           int nftw(const char *, int (*)(const char *, const struct stat *,
               int, struct FTW *), int, int);
       The <ftw.h> header shall define the stat structure and the symbolic
       names for st_mode and the file type test macros as described in
       <sys/stat.h>.
       Inclusion of the <ftw.h> header may also make visible all symbols
       from <sys/stat.h>.
       The following sections are informative.
