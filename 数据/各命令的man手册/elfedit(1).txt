       elfedit updates the ELF header of ELF files which have the matching
       ELF machine and file types.  The options control how and which fields
       in the ELF header should be updated.
       elffile... are the ELF files to be updated.  32-bit and 64-bit ELF
       files are supported, as are archives containing ELF files.
