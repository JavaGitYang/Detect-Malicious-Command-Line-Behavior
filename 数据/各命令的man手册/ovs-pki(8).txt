       The ovs-pki program sets up and manages a public key infrastructure
       for use with OpenFlow.  It is intended to be a simple interface for
       organizations that do not have an established public key
       infrastructure.  Other PKI tools can substitute for or supplement the
       use of ovs-pki.
       ovs-pki uses openssl(1) for certificate management and key
       generation.
