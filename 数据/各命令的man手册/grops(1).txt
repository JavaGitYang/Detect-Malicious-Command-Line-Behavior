       grops translates the output of GNU troff to PostScript.  Normally
       grops should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tps
       option.  (Actually, this is the default for groff.)  If no files are
       given, grops reads the standard input.  A filename of - also causes
       grops to read the standard input.  PostScript output is written to
       the standard output.  When grops is run by groff options can be
       passed to grops using groff's -P option.
       Note that grops doesn't produce a valid document structure
       (conforming to the Document Structuring Convention) if called with
       multiple file arguments.  To print such concatenated output it is
       necessary to deactivate DSC handling in the printing program or
       previewer.  See section FONT INSTALLATION below for a guide how to
       install fonts for grops.
