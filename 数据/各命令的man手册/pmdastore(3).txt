       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaStore is the generic callback for storing a value into
       a metric.  pmdaStore is usually a no-op as, by default, no metrics
       can be altered.  Also, the implementation of a store callback which
       does permit metrics to be altered by pmstore(1) is very application
       dependent.
