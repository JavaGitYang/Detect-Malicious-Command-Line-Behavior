       The variables whose names are specified shall be given the readonly
       attribute. The values of variables with the readonly attribute cannot
       be changed by subsequent assignment, nor can those variables be unset
       by the unset utility. If the name of a variable is followed by =word,
       then the value of that variable shall be set to word.
       The readonly special built-in shall support the Base Definitions
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
       When −p is specified, readonly writes to the standard output the
       names and values of all read-only variables, in the following format:
           "readonly %s=%s\n", <name>, <value>
       if name is set, and
           "readonly %s\n", <name>
       if name is unset.
       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands
       that achieve the same value and readonly attribute-setting results in
       a shell execution environment in which:
        1. Variables with values at the time they were output do not have
           the readonly attribute set.
        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output do not
           have a value at the time at which the saved output is reinput to
           the shell.
       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified.
