       pmdabcc is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which extracts
       live performance data from extended BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter)
       programs by using BCC (BPF Compiler Collection) Python frontend.
       pmdabcc itself provides no PCP metrics or BPF code; instead it loads
       and acts as a bridge for any number of configured, separate PCP BCC
       PMDA Python modules running BPF programs.  Existing BCC Python tools
       and programs should be possible to be utilized with PCP BCC PMDA
       modules with reasonable effort.
       See the BPF and BCC documentation for detailed description of both.
