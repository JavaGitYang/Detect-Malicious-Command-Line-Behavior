       pcp-dmcache reports on the activity of any configured Device Mapper
       Cache targets.  The reported information includes device IOPs, cache
       and metadata device utilization, as well as hit and miss rates and
       ratios for both reads and writes for each cache device.
       pcp-lvmcache (Logical Volume Manager cache) is an exact synonym for
       pcp-dmcache (Device Mapper cache).
       When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
       -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and several
       other pcp options become indirectly available.
       By default, pcp-dmcache reports on all available cache target devices
       (one line each, per sample), but this can be restricted to specific
       devices on the command line.
