       renice alters the scheduling priority of one or more running
       processes.  The first argument is the priority value to be used.  The
       other arguments are interpreted as process IDs (by default), process
       group IDs, user IDs, or user names.  renice'ing a process group
       causes all processes in the process group to have their scheduling
       priority altered.  renice'ing a user causes all processes owned by
       the user to have their scheduling priority altered.
