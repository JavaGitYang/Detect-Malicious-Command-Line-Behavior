       Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. "a patch") and applies it to
       files. When running from a subdirectory in a repository, patched
       paths outside the directory are ignored. With the --index option the
       patch is also applied to the index, and with the --cached option the
       patch is only applied to the index. Without these options, the
       command applies the patch only to files, and does not require them to
       be in a Git repository.
       This command applies the patch but does not create a commit. Use
       git-am(1) to create commits from patches generated by
       git-format-patch(1) and/or received by email.
