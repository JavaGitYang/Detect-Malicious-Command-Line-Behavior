       The ldap_parse_reference() routine is used to extract referrals and
       controls from a reference message.  The reference parameter is a
       reference message as returned by a call to ldap_first_reference(3),
       ldap_next_reference(3), ldap_first_message(3), ldap_next_message(3),
       or ldap_result(3).
       The referralsp parameter will be filled in with an allocated array of
       character strings. The strings are copies of the referrals contained
       in the parsed message. The array should be freed by calling
       ldap_value_free(3).  If referralsp is NULL, no referrals are
       returned.  If no referrals were returned, *referralsp is set to NULL.
       The serverctrlsp parameter will be filled in with an allocated array
       of controls copied from the parsed message. The array should be freed
       by calling ldap_controls_free(3).  If serverctrlsp is NULL, no
       controls are returned.  If no controls were returned, *serverctrlsp
       is set to NULL.
       The freeit parameter determines whether the parsed message is freed
       or not after the extraction. Any non-zero value will make it free the
       message. The ldap_msgfree(3) routine can also be used to free the
       message later.
