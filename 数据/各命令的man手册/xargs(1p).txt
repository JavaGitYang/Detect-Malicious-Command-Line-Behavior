       The xargs utility shall construct a command line consisting of the
       utility and argument operands specified followed by as many arguments
       read in sequence from standard input as fit in length and number
       constraints specified by the options. The xargs utility shall then
       invoke the constructed command line and wait for its completion. This
       sequence shall be repeated until one of the following occurs:
        *  An end-of-file condition is detected on standard input.
        *  An argument consisting of just the logical end-of-file string
           (see the −E eofstr option) is found on standard input after
           double-quote processing, <apostrophe> processing, and
           <backslash>-escape processing (see next paragraph). All arguments
           up to but not including the argument consisting of just the
           logical end-of-file string shall be used as arguments in
           constructed command lines.
        *  An invocation of a constructed command line returns an exit
           status of 255.
       The application shall ensure that arguments in the standard input are
       separated by unquoted <blank> characters, unescaped <blank>
       characters, or <newline> characters. A string of zero or more non-
       double-quote ('"') characters and non-<newline> characters can be
       quoted by enclosing them in double-quotes. A string of zero or more
       non-<apostrophe> ('\'') characters and non-<newline> characters can
       be quoted by enclosing them in <apostrophe> characters. Any unquoted
       character can be escaped by preceding it with a <backslash>.  The
       utility named by utility shall be executed one or more times until
       the end-of-file is reached or the logical end-of file string is
       found. The results are unspecified if the utility named by utility
       attempts to read from its standard input.
       The generated command line length shall be the sum of the size in
       bytes of the utility name and each argument treated as strings,
       including a null byte terminator for each of these strings. The xargs
       utility shall limit the command line length such that when the
       command line is invoked, the combined argument and environment lists
       (see the exec family of functions in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008) shall not exceed {ARG_MAX}−2048 bytes. Within this
       constraint, if neither the −n nor the −s option is specified, the
       default command line length shall be at least {LINE_MAX}.
