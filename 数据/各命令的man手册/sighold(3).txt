       These functions are provided in glibc as a compatibility interface
       for programs that make use of the historical System V signal API.
       This API is obsolete: new applications should use the POSIX signal
       API (sigaction(2), sigprocmask(2), etc.)
       The sigset() function modifies the disposition of the signal sig.
       The disp argument can be the address of a signal handler function, or
       one of the following constants:
       SIG_DFL
              Reset the disposition of sig to the default.
       SIG_IGN
              Ignore sig.
       SIG_HOLD
              Add sig to the process's signal mask, but leave the
              disposition of sig unchanged.
       If disp specifies the address of a signal handler, then sig is added
       to the process's signal mask during execution of the handler.
       If disp was specified as a value other than SIG_HOLD, then sig is
       removed from the process's signal mask.
       The dispositions for SIGKILL and SIGSTOP cannot be changed.
       The sighold() function adds sig to the calling process's signal mask.
       The sigrelse() function removes sig from the calling process's signal
       mask.
       The sigignore() function sets the disposition of sig to SIG_IGN.
