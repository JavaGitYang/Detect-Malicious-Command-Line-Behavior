       hpsa is a SCSI driver for HP Smart Array RAID controllers.
   Options
       hpsa_allow_any=1: This option allows the driver to attempt to operate
       on any HP Smart Array hardware RAID controller, even if it is not
       explicitly known to the driver.  This allows newer hardware to work
       with older drivers.  Typically this is used to allow installation of
       operating systems from media that predates the RAID controller,
       though it may also be used to enable hpsa to drive older controllers
       that would normally be handled by the cciss(4) driver.  These older
       boards have not been tested and are not supported with hpsa, and
       cciss(4) should still be used for these.
   Supported hardware
       The hpsa driver supports the following Smart Array boards:
           Smart Array P700M
           Smart Array P212
           Smart Array P410
           Smart Array P410i

   Configuration details
       To configure HP Smart Array controllers, use the HP Array
       Configuration Utility (either hpacuxe(8) or hpacucli(8)) or the
       Offline ROM-based Configuration Utility (ORCA) run from the Smart
       Array's option ROM at boot time.
