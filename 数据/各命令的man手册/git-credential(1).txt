       Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials
       from system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for
       usernames and passwords. The git-credential command exposes this
       interface to scripts which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for
       credentials in the same manner as Git. The design of this scriptable
       interface models the internal C API; see the Git credential API[1]
       for more background on the concepts.
       git-credential takes an "action" option on the command-line (one of
       fill, approve, or reject) and reads a credential description on stdin
       (see INPUT/OUTPUT FORMAT).
       If the action is fill, git-credential will attempt to add "username"
       and "password" attributes to the description by reading config files,
       by contacting any configured credential helpers, or by prompting the
       user. The username and password attributes of the credential
       description are then printed to stdout together with the attributes
       already provided.
       If the action is approve, git-credential will send the description to
       any configured credential helpers, which may store the credential for
       later use.
       If the action is reject, git-credential will send the description to
       any configured credential helpers, which may erase any stored
       credential matching the description.
       If the action is approve or reject, no output should be emitted.
