       The stapdyn program is the dyninst back-end of the Systemtap tool.
       It expects a shared library produced by the front-end stap tool, when
       run with --dyninst.
       Splitting the systemtap tool into a front-end and a back-end allows a
       user to compile a systemtap script on a development machine that has
       the debugging information (need to compile the script) and then
       transfer the resulting shared object to a production machine that
       doesn't have any development tools or debugging information
       installed.
       Please refer to stappaths (7) for the version number, or run rpm -q
       systemtap (fedora/red hat) apt-get -v systemtap (ubuntu)
