       The status of a batch job, batch queue, or batch server is obtained
       by a request to the server. The qstat utility is a user-accessible
       batch client that requests the status of one or more batch jobs,
       batch queues, or servers, and writes the status information to
       standard output.
       For each successfully processed batch job_identifier, the qstat
       utility shall display information about the corresponding batch job.
       For each successfully processed destination, the qstat utility shall
       display information about the corresponding batch queue.
       For each successfully processed server name, the qstat utility shall
       display information about the corresponding server.
       The qstat utility shall acquire batch job status information by
       sending a Job Status Request to a batch server. The qstat utility
       shall acquire batch queue status information by sending a Queue
       Status Request to a batch server. The qstat utility shall acquire
       server status information by sending a Server Status Request to a
       batch server.
