       numastat with no command options or arguments at all, displays per-
       node NUMA hit and miss system statistics from the kernel memory
       allocator.  This default numastat behavior is strictly compatible
       with the previous long-standing numastat perl script, written by Andi
       Kleen.  The default numastat statistics shows per-node numbers (in
       units of pages of memory) in these categories:
       numa_hit is memory successfully allocated on this node as intended.
       numa_miss is memory allocated on this node despite the process
       preferring some different node. Each numa_miss has a numa_foreign on
       another node.
       numa_foreign is memory intended for this node, but actually allocated
       on some different node.  Each numa_foreign has a numa_miss on another
       node.
       interleave_hit is interleaved memory successfully allocated on this
       node as intended.
       local_node is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on it.
       other_node is memory allocated on this node while a process was
       running on some other node.
       Any supplied options or arguments with the numastat command will
       significantly change both the content and the format of the display.
       Specified options will cause display units to change to megabytes of
       memory, and will change other specific behaviors of numastat as
       described below.
