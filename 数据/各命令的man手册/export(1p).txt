       The shell shall give the export attribute to the variables
       corresponding to the specified names, which shall cause them to be in
       the environment of subsequently executed commands. If the name of a
       variable is followed by =word, then the value of that variable shall
       be set to word.
       The export special built-in shall support the Base Definitions volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.
       When −p is specified, export shall write to the standard output the
       names and values of all exported variables, in the following format:
           "export %s=%s\n", <name>, <value>
       if name is set, and:
           "export %s\n", <name>
       if name is unset.
       The shell shall format the output, including the proper use of
       quoting, so that it is suitable for reinput to the shell as commands
       that achieve the same exporting results, except:
        1. Read-only variables with values cannot be reset.
        2. Variables that were unset at the time they were output need not
           be reset to the unset state if a value is assigned to the
           variable between the time the state was saved and the time at
           which the saved output is reinput to the shell.
       When no arguments are given, the results are unspecified. If a
       variable assignment precedes the command name of export but that
       variable is not also listed as an operand of export, then that
       variable shall be set in the current shell execution environment
       after the completion of the export command, but it is unspecified
       whether that variable is marked for export.
