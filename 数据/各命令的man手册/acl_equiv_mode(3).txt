     The acl_equiv_mode() function checks if the ACL pointed to by the argu‐
     ment acl contains only the required ACL entries of tag types
     ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER, and contains no permissions
     other that ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE or ACL_EXECUTE.  If the ACL has this
     form, it can can be fully represented with the traditional file permis‐
     sion bits, and is considered equivalent with the traditional file per‐
     mission bits.
     If acl is an equivalent ACL and the pointer mode_p is not NULL, the
     value pointed to by mode_p is set to the value that defines the same
     owner, group and other permissions as contained in the ACL.
