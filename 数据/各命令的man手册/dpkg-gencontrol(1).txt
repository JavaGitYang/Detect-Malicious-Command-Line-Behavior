       dpkg-gencontrol reads information from an unpacked Debian source tree
       and generates a binary package control file (which defaults to
       debian/tmp/DEBIAN/control); during this process it will simplify the
       relation fields.
       Thus Pre-Depends, Depends, Recommends and Suggests are simplified in
       this order by removing dependencies which are known to be true
       according to the stronger dependencies already parsed. It will also
       remove any self-dependency (in fact it will remove any dependency
       which evaluates to true given the current version of the package as
       installed). Logically it keeps the intersection of multiple
       dependencies on the same package. The order of dependencies is
       preserved as best as possible: if any dependency must be discarded
       due to another dependency appearing further in the field, the
       superseding dependency will take the place of the discarded one.
       The other relation fields (Enhances, Conflicts, Breaks, Replaces and
       Provides) are also simplified individually by computing the union of
       the various dependencies when a package is listed multiple times in
       the field.
       dpkg-gencontrol also adds an entry for the binary package to
       debian/files.
