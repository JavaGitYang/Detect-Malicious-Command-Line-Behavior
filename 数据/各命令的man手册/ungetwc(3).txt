       The ungetwc() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       ungetc(3) function.  It pushes back a wide character onto stream and
       returns it.
       If wc is WEOF, it returns WEOF.  If wc is an invalid wide character,
       it sets errno to EILSEQ and returns WEOF.
       If wc is a valid wide character, it is pushed back onto the stream
       and thus becomes available for future wide-character read operations.
       The file-position indicator is decremented by one or more.  The end-
       of-file indicator is cleared.  The backing storage of the file is not
       affected.
       Note: wc need not be the last wide-character read from the stream; it
       can be any other valid wide character.
       If the implementation supports multiple push-back operations in a
       row, the pushed-back wide characters will be read in reverse order;
       however, only one level of push-back is guaranteed.
