       systemd-debug-generator is a generator that reads the kernel command
       line and understands three options:
       If the systemd.mask= option is specified and followed by a unit name,
       this unit is masked for the runtime, similar to the effect of
       systemctl(1)'s mask command. This is useful to boot with certain
       units removed from the initial boot transaction for debugging system
       startup. May be specified more than once.
       If the systemd.wants= option is specified and followed by a unit
       name, a start job for this unit is added to the initial transaction.
       This is useful to start one or more additional units at boot. May be
       specified more than once.
       If the systemd.debug_shell option is specified, the debug shell
       service "debug-shell.service" is pulled into the boot transaction. It
       will spawn a debug shell on tty9 during early system startup. Note
       that the shell may also be turned on persistently by enabling it with
       systemctl(1)'s enable command.
       systemd-debug-generator implements systemd.generator(7).
