       systemd-cgls recursively shows the contents of the selected Linux
       control group hierarchy in a tree. If arguments are specified, shows
       all member processes of the specified control groups plus all their
       subgroups and their members. The control groups may either be
       specified by their full file paths or are assumed in the systemd
       control group hierarchy. If no argument is specified and the current
       working directory is beneath the control group mount point
       /sys/fs/cgroup, shows the contents of the control group the working
       directory refers to. Otherwise, the full systemd control group
       hierarchy is shown.
       By default, empty control groups are not shown.
