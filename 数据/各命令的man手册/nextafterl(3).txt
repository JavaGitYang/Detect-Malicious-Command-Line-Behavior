       The nextafter(), nextafterf(), and nextafterl() functions return the
       next representable floating-point value following x in the direction
       of y.  If y is less than x, these functions will return the largest
       representable number less than x.
       If x equals y, the functions return y.
       The nexttoward(), nexttowardf(), and nexttowardl() functions do the
       same as the corresponding nextafter() functions, except that they
       have a long double second argument.
