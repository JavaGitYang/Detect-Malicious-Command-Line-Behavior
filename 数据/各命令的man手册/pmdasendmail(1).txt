       pmdasendmail is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
       which exports mail traffic statistics as collected by sendmail(1).
       Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics, sendmail(1) must
       have statistics collection enabled.  This involves checking the name
       of the statistics file, as given by the OS or O StatusFile control
       lines in /etc/sendmail.cf, and then creating this file if it does not
       already exist.  Removing the file will terminate statistics
       collection by sendmail(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.
       A brief description of the pmdasendmail command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            sendmail.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdasendmail is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
       There are no communication options, as the Install script ensures the
       sendmail PMDA will be connected to PMCD by a pipe.
