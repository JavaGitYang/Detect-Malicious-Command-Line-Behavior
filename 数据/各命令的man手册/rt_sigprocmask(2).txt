       sigprocmask() is used to fetch and/or change the signal mask of the
       calling thread.  The signal mask is the set of signals whose delivery
       is currently blocked for the caller (see also signal(7) for more
       details).
       The behavior of the call is dependent on the value of how, as
       follows.
       SIG_BLOCK
              The set of blocked signals is the union of the current set and
              the set argument.
       SIG_UNBLOCK
              The signals in set are removed from the current set of blocked
              signals.  It is permissible to attempt to unblock a signal
              which is not blocked.
       SIG_SETMASK
              The set of blocked signals is set to the argument set.
       If oldset is non-NULL, the previous value of the signal mask is
       stored in oldset.
       If set is NULL, then the signal mask is unchanged (i.e., how is
       ignored), but the current value of the signal mask is nevertheless
       returned in oldset (if it is not NULL).
       A set of functions for modifying and inspecting variables of type
       sigset_t ("signal sets") is described in sigsetops(3).
       The use of sigprocmask() is unspecified in a multithreaded process;
       see pthread_sigmask(3).
