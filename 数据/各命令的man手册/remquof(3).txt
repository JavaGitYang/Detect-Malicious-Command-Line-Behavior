       These functions compute the remainder and part of the quotient upon
       division of x by y.  A few bits of the quotient are stored via the
       quo pointer.  The remainder is returned as the function result.
       The value of the remainder is the same as that computed by the
       remainder(3) function.
       The value stored via the quo pointer has the sign of x / y and agrees
       with the quotient in at least the low order 3 bits.
       For example, remquo(29.0, 3.0) returns -1.0 and might store 2.  Note
       that the actual quotient might not fit in an integer.
