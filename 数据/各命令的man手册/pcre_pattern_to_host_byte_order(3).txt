       This function ensures that the bytes in 2-byte and 4-byte values in a
       compiled pattern are in the correct order for the current host. It is
       useful when a pattern that has been compiled on one host is
       transferred to another that might have different endianness. The
       arguments are:
         code         A compiled regular expression
         extra        Points to an associated pcre[16|32]_extra structure,
                        or is NULL
         tables       Pointer to character tables, or NULL to
                        set the built-in default
       The result is 0 for success, a negative PCRE_ERROR_xxx value
       otherwise.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
