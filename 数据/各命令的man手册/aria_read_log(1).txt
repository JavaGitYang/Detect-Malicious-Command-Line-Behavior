       Display and apply log records from a Aria transaction log found in
       the current directory (for now)
       Note: Aria is compiled without -DIDENTICAL_PAGES_AFTER_RECOVERY which
       means that the table files are not byte-to-byte identical to files
       created during normal execution. This should be ok, except for test
       scripts that tries to compare files before and after recovery.
       You need to use one of -d or -a
       -a, --apply
              Apply log to tables: modifies tables! you should make a backup

              Directory where character sets are.

              display brief info read from records' header
       -e, --end-lsn=#
              Stop applying at this lsn. If end-lsn is used, UNDO:s will not

       -o, --start-from-lsn=#
              Start reading log from this lsn
       -C, --start-from-checkpoint

       -u, --undo
              Apply UNDO records to tables. (disable with --disable-undo)
              (Defaults to on; use --skip-undo to disable.)
       -v, --verbose
              Print more information during apply/undo phase
