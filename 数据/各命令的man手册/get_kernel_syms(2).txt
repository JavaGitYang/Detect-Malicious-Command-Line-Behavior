       Note: This system call is present only in kernels before Linux 2.6.
       If table is NULL, get_kernel_syms() returns the number of symbols
       available for query.  Otherwise, it fills in a table of structures:
           struct kernel_sym {
               unsigned long value;
               char          name[60];
           };
       The symbols are interspersed with magic symbols of the form #module-
       name with the kernel having an empty name.  The value associated with
       a symbol of this form is the address at which the module is loaded.
       The symbols exported from each module follow their magic module tag
       and the modules are returned in the reverse of the order in which
       they were loaded.
