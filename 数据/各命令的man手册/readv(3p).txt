       The readv() function shall be equivalent to read(), except as
       described below. The readv() function shall place the input data into
       the iovcnt buffers specified by the members of the iov array: iov[0],
       iov[1], ..., iov[iovcntâˆ’1].  The iovcnt argument is valid if greater
       than 0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}.
       Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in
       memory where data should be placed. The readv() function shall always
       fill an area completely before proceeding to the next.
       Upon successful completion, readv() shall mark for update the last
       data access timestamp of the file.
