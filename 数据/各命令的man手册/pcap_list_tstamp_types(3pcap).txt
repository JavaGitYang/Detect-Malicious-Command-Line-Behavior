       pcap_list_tstamp_types() is used to get a list of the supported time
       stamp types of the interface associated with the pcap descriptor.
       pcap_list_tstamp_types() allocates an array to hold the list and sets
       *tstamp_typesp to point to the array.  See pcap-tstamp(7) for a list
       of all the time stamp types.
       The caller is responsible for freeing the array with
       pcap_free_tstamp_types(), which frees the list pointed to by
       tstamp_types.
