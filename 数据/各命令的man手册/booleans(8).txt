       This manual page describes SELinux policy booleans.   The SELinux
       policy can include conditional rules that are enabled or disabled
       based on the current values of a set of policy booleans.  These
       policy booleans allow runtime modification of the security policy
       without having to load a new policy.
       For example, the boolean httpd_enable_cgi allows the httpd daemon to
       run cgi scripts if it is enabled.  If the administrator does not want
       to allow execution of cgi scripts, he can simply disable this boolean
       value.
       The policy defines a default value for each boolean, typically false.
       These default values can be overridden via local settings created via
       the setsebool(8) utility, using -P to make the setting persistent
       across reboots.  The system-config-securitylevel tool provides a
       graphical interface for altering the settings.  The load_policy(8)
       program will preserve current boolean settings upon a policy reload
       by default, or can optionally reset booleans to the boot-time
       defaults via the -b option.
       Boolean values can be listed by using the getsebool(8) utility and
       passing it the -a option.
       Boolean values can also be changed at runtime via the setsebool(8)
       utility or the togglesebool(8) utility.  By default, these utilities
       only change the current boolean value and do not affect the
       persistent settings, unless the -P option is used to setsebool.
