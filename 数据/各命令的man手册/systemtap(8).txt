       The SystemTap initscript aims to provide a way to run scripts as a
       service and easily control them individually. Scripts can be
       configured to start upon manual request, or during system startup. On
       dracut-based systems, it is also possible to integrate scripts in the
       initramfs and have them start during early-boot.
       There are various parameters and options available to modify global
       behaviour, as well as script behaviour. Dependencies between scripts
       can be established so that starting one starts others.
       The configuration file of the initscript is located at
       ${prefix}/etc/systemtap/config. Acceptable parameters are detailed in
       the GLOBAL PARAMETERS section.
       Scripts must be placed in the ${prefix}/etc/systemtap/script.d
       directory and must have a .stp extension. When referring to them on
       the command-line however, there in no need to include the .stp
       extension.  Script names can only contain alphanumeric characters
       (and '_') and must not start with a number. The scripts directory may
       be changed by setting the SCRIPT_PATH parameter in the configuration
       file.
