       This function will generate a new pair of prime and generator for use
       in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This may take long time.
       It is recommended not to set the number of bits directly, but use
       gnutls_sec_param_to_pk_bits() instead.  Also note that the DH
       parameters are only useful to servers.  Since clients use the
       parameters sent by the server, it's of no use to call this in client
       side.
       The parameters generated are of the DSA form. It also is possible to
       generate provable parameters (following the Shawe-Taylor algorithm),
       using gnutls_x509_privkey_generate2() with DSA option and the
       GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_FLAG_PROVABLE flag set. These can the be imported with
       gnutls_dh_params_import_dsa().
       It is no longer recommended for applications to generate parameters.
       See the "Parameter generation" section in the manual.
