       This is probably not the system call that you are interested in;
       instead, see mmap(2), which describes the glibc wrapper function that
       invokes this system call.
       The mmap2() system call provides the same interface as mmap(2),
       except that the final argument specifies the offset into the file in
       4096-byte units (instead of bytes, as is done by mmap(2)).  This
       enables applications that use a 32-bit off_t to map large files (up
       to 2^44 bytes).
