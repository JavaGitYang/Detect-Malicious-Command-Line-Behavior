       The posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() function shall destroy the
       object referenced by file_actions; the object becomes, in effect,
       uninitialized. An implementation may cause
       posix_spawn_file_actions_destroy() to set the object referenced by
       file_actions to an invalid value. A destroyed spawn file actions
       object can be reinitialized using posix_spawn_file_actions_init();
       the results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been
       destroyed are undefined.
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_init() function shall initialize the
       object referenced by file_actions to contain no file actions for
       posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() to perform.
       A spawn file actions object is as defined in
       posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3p).
       The effect of initializing an already initialized spawn file actions
       object is undefined.
