       This PMDA extracts performance data from BIND (Berkeley Internet Name
       Domain).  It enables collection of most of the statistics metrics
       from the Bind server version 9 or later, which includes:
       · overall memory statistics
       · overall per-query statistics (general queries, EDNS/truncated
         responses, Update/Notify/AXFR/IXFR messages)
       · overall error statistics (Rejected, SERVFAIL, Update/XFR failures
         ...)
       · overall statistics per transport protocol, EDNS and per version of
         IP protocol
       · resolver statistics (successes, errors, round-trip times in several
         ranges)
       · detailed per-socket statistics with respect to the transport
         protcol and IP version including errors
       · detailed per-file-descriptor statistics including errors
       The PMDA performs per-second collection of the whole data set (148
       metrics on the test environment) with modest requirements (2% CPU
       usage on Intel i7-4700MQ @2.4 GHz, cca 30 MB RAM).
       If more than 1 requests/sec is performed, the memoized values are
       used so that the statistics interface of the Bind server does not get
       overloaded.
