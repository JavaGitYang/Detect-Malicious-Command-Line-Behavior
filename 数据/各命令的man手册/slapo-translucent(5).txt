       The Translucent Proxy overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as slapd-bdb(5) to create a "translucent proxy".  Entries
       retrieved from a remote LDAP server may have some or all attributes
       overridden, or new attributes added, by entries in the local database
       before being presented to the client.
       A search operation is first populated with entries from the remote
       LDAP server, the attributes of which are then overridden with any
       attributes defined in the local database. Local overrides may be
       populated with the add, modify , and modrdn operations, the use of
       which is restricted to the root user.
       A compare operation will perform a comparison with attributes defined
       in the local database record (if any) before any comparison is made
       with data in the remote database.
