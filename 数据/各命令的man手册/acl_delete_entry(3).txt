     The acl_delete_entry() function removes the ACL entry indicated by the
     entry_d descriptor from the ACL pointed to by acl.  Any existing ACL
     entry descriptors that refer to entries in acl other than that referred
     to by entry_d continue to refer to the same entries. The argument
     entry_d and any other ACL entry descriptors that refer to the same ACL
     entry are undefined after this function completes. Any existing ACL
     pointers that refer to the ACL referred to by acl continue to refer to
     the ACL.
