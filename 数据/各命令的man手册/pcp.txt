       The pcp.env script is sourced by assorted Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
       scripts and utilities to define the PCP operating environment
       variables.  The conjugate for executable programs using the PCP
       libraries is the __pmGetConfig(3) function.
       Typical usage of pcp.env in a script is as follows :
                #! /bin/sh
                # source the PCP environment variables
                . /etc/pcp.env
                rest of script ...
       The full syntax and semantics of the pcp.conf file and the
       __pmGetConfig function are described in their respective reference
       pages.
       If the file $HOME/.pcp/pcp.conf exists then this will be processed
       after the system-wide pcp.conf file.  This provides a mechanism to
       selectively modify or augment the environment settings for PCP
       scripts, which maybe useful if the scripts are run with sudo(1) which
       cleans the environment of important settings that are required to
       ensure the correct execution of the PCP scripts, e.g.  $PATH or
       $PERL5LIB.
