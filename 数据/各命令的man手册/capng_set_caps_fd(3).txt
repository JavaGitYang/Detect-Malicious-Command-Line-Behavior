       This function will write the file based capabilities to the extended
       attributes of the file that the descriptor was opened against. The
       bounding set is not included in file based capabilities operations.
       Note that this function will only work if compiled on a kernel that
       supports file based capabilities such as 2.6.2 6 and later.
