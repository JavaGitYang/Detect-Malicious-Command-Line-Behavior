       This function will return the public key algorithm of an X.509
       certificate.
       If bits is non null, it should have enough size to hold the
       parameters size in bits. For RSA the bits returned is the modulus.
       For DSA the bits returned are of the public exponent.
       Unknown/unsupported algorithms are mapped to GNUTLS_PK_UNKNOWN.
