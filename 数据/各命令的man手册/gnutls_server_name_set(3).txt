       This function is to be used by clients that want to inform (via a TLS
       extension mechanism) the server of the name they connected to.  This
       should be used by clients that connect to servers that do virtual
       hosting.
       The value of  name depends on the  type type.  In case of
       GNUTLS_NAME_DNS, a UTF-8 null-terminated domain name string, without
       the trailing dot, is expected.
       IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are not permitted to be set by this function.
       If the function is called with a name of  name_length zero it will
       clear all server names set.
