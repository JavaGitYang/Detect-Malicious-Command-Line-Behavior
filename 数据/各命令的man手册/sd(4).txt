       The following ioctls are provided:
       HDIO_GETGEO
              Returns the BIOS disk parameters in the following structure:
           struct hd_geometry {
               unsigned char  heads;
               unsigned char  sectors;
               unsigned short cylinders;
               unsigned long  start;
           };
              A pointer to this structure is passed as the ioctl(2) parame‐
              ter.
              The information returned in the parameter is the disk geometry
              of the drive as understood by DOS!  This geometry is not the
              physical geometry of the drive.  It is used when constructing
              the drive's partition table, however, and is needed for conve‐
              nient operation of fdisk(1), efdisk(1), and lilo(1).  If the
              geometry information is not available, zero will be returned
              for all of the parameters.
       BLKGETSIZE
              Returns the device size in sectors.  The ioctl(2) parameter
              should be a pointer to a long.
       BLKRRPART
              Forces a reread of the SCSI disk partition tables.  No parame‐
              ter is needed.
              The SCSI ioctl(2) operations are also supported.  If the
              ioctl(2) parameter is required, and it is NULL, then ioctl(2)
              fails with the error EINVAL.
