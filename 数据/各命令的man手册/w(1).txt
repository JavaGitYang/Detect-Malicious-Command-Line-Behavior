       w displays information about the users currently on the machine, and
       their processes.  The header shows, in this order, the current time,
       how long the system has been running, how many users are currently
       logged on, and the system load averages for the past 1, 5, and 15
       minutes.
       The following entries are displayed for each user: login name, the
       tty name, the remote host, login time, idle time, JCPU, PCPU, and the
       command line of their current process.
       The JCPU time is the time used by all processes attached to the tty.
       It does not include past background jobs, but does include currently
       running background jobs.
       The PCPU time is the time used by the current process, named in the
       "what" field.
