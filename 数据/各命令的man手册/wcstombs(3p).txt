       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcstombs() function shall convert the sequence of wide-character
       codes that are in the array pointed to by pwcs into a sequence of
       characters that begins in the initial shift state and store these
       characters into the array pointed to by s, stopping if a character
       would exceed the limit of n total bytes or if a null byte is stored.
       Each wide-character code shall be converted as if by a call to
       wctomb(), except that the shift state of wctomb() shall not be
       affected.
       The behavior of this function shall be affected by the LC_CTYPE
       category of the current locale.
       No more than n bytes shall be modified in the array pointed to by s.
       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.  If s is a null pointer, wcstombs() shall return the
       length required to convert the entire array regardless of the value
       of n, but no values are stored.
