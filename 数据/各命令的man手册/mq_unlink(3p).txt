       The mq_unlink() function shall remove the message queue named by the
       string name.  If one or more processes have the message queue open
       when mq_unlink() is called, destruction of the message queue shall be
       postponed until all references to the message queue have been closed.
       However, the mq_unlink() call need not block until all references
       have been closed; it may return immediately.
       After a successful call to mq_unlink(), reuse of the name shall
       subsequently cause mq_open() to behave as if no message queue of this
       name exists (that is, mq_open() will fail if O_CREAT is not set, or
       will create a new message queue if O_CREAT is set).
