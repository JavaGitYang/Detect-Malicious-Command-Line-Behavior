   devlink sb show - display available shared buffers and their attributes
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to show shared buffers.  If this
       argument is omitted all shared buffers of all devices are listed.
       SB_INDEX - specifies the shared buffer.  If this argument is omitted
       shared buffer with index 0 is selected.  Behaviour of this argument
       it the same for every command.
   devlink sb pool show - display available pools and their attributes
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to show pools.  If this argument
       is omitted all pools of all devices are listed.
   devlink sb pool set - set attributes of pool
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to set pool.
       size POOL_SIZE
              size of the pool in Bytes.
       thtype { static | dynamic }
              pool threshold type.
              static - Threshold values for the pool will be passed in
              Bytes.
              dynamic - Threshold values ("to_alpha") for the pool will be
              used to compute alpha parameter according to formula:
                              alpha = 2 ^ (to_alpha - 10)
                        The range of the passed value is between 0 to 20.
                        The computed alpha is used to determine the maximum
                        usage of the flow:
                              max_usage = alpha / (1 + alpha) * Free_Buffer
   devlink sb port pool show - display port-pool combinations and threshold
       for each
       DEV/PORT_INDEX - specifies the devlink port.
       pool POOL_INDEX
              pool index.
   devlink sb port pool set - set port-pool threshold
       DEV/PORT_INDEX - specifies the devlink port.
       pool POOL_INDEX
              pool index.
       th THRESHOLD
              threshold value. Type of the value is either Bytes or
              "to_alpha", depends on thtype set for the pool.
   devlink sb tc bind show - display port-TC to pool bindings and threshold
       for each
       DEV/PORT_INDEX - specifies the devlink port.
       tc TC_INDEX
              index of either ingress or egress TC, usually in range 0 to 8
              (depends on device).
       type { ingress | egress }
              TC type.
   devlink sb tc bind set - set port-TC to pool binding with specified
       threshold
       DEV/PORT_INDEX - specifies the devlink port.
       tc TC_INDEX
              index of either ingress or egress TC, usually in range 0 to 8
              (depends on device).
       type { ingress | egress }
              TC type.
       pool POOL_INDEX
              index of pool to bind this to.
       th THRESHOLD
              threshold value. Type of the value is either Bytes or
              "to_alpha", depends on thtype set for the pool.
   devlink sb occupancy show - display shared buffer occupancy values for
       device or port
       This command is used to browse shared buffer occupancy values. Values
       are showed for every port-pool combination as well as for all port-TC
       combinations (with pool this port-TC is bound to). Format of value
       is:
                       current_value/max_value
       Note that before showing values, one has to issue occupancy snapshot
       command first.
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to show occupancy values for.
       DEV/PORT_INDEX - specifies the devlink port to show occupancy values
       for.
   devlink sb occupancy snapshot - take occupancy snapshot of shared buffer
       for device
       This command is used to take a snapshot of shared buffer occupancy
       values. After that, the values can be showed using occupancy show
       command.
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to take occupancy snapshot on.
   devlink sb occupancy clearmax - clear occupancy watermarks of shared
       buffer for device
       This command is used to reset maximal occupancy values reached for
       whole device. Note that before browsing reset values, one has to
       issue occupancy snapshot command.
       DEV - specifies the devlink device to clear occupancy watermarks on.
