       dpkg-architecture provides a facility to determine and set the build
       and host architecture for package building.
       The build architecture is always determined by an external call to
       dpkg(1), and cannot be set at the command line.
       You can specify the host architecture by providing one or both of the
       options --host-arch and --host-type. The default is determined by an
       external call to gcc(1), or the same as the build architecture if CC
       or gcc are both not available. One out of --host-arch and --host-type
       is sufficient, the value of the other will be set to a usable
       default. Indeed, it is often better to only specify one, because
       dpkg-architecture will warn you if your choice does not match the
       default.
