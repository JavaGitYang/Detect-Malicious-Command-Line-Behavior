       dpkg-deb packs, unpacks and provides information about Debian
       archives.
       Use dpkg to install and remove packages from your system.
       You can also invoke dpkg-deb by calling dpkg with whatever options
       you want to pass to dpkg-deb. dpkg will spot that you wanted dpkg-deb
       and run it for you.
       For most commands taking an input archive argument, the archive can
       be read from standard input if the archive name is given as a single
       minus character («-»); otherwise lack of support will be documented
       in their respective command description.
