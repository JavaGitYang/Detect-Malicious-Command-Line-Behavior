       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The getenv() function shall search the environment of the calling
       process (see the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Chapter 8,
       Environment Variables) for the environment variable name if it exists
       and return a pointer to the value of the environment variable. If the
       specified environment variable cannot be found, a null pointer shall
       be returned. The application shall ensure that it does not modify the
       string pointed to by the getenv() function.
       The returned string pointer might be invalidated or the string
       content might be overwritten by a subsequent call to getenv(),
       setenv(), unsetenv(), or (if supported) putenv() but they shall not
       be affected by a call to any other function in this volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008.
       The getenv() function need not be thread-safe.
