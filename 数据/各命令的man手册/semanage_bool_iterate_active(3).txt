       Behavior:
              The iterate function will execute the specified handler over
              all objects in the selected location. An arbitrary argument
              can be passed into the handler function along with each
              object.
              The object passed in is property of the libsemanage library,
              and may not be modified or preserved - use
              semanage_OBJECT_clone if that is necessary.
              The handler code may not invoke any semanage write requests
              for the same object type (i.e. modifying the underlying store
              is not allowed). The iterate function is reentrant only while
              inside a transaction (see semanage_begin_transaction ). It is
              not safe to execute other semanage read or write requests
              within iterate if not inside a transaction. The handler may
              return -1 to signal error exit, 0 to signal continue, and 1 to
              signal successful exit early (the iterate function will stop
              accordingly).
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The handler is the function to
              execute, with handler_arg as its second parameter, and each
              object as its first parameter.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) )
