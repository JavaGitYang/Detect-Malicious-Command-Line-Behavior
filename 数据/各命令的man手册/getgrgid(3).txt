       The getgrnam() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of the record in the group database (e.g., the
       local group file /etc/group, NIS, and LDAP) that matches the group
       name name.
       The getgrgid() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of the record in the group database that
       matches the group ID gid.
       The group structure is defined in <grp.h> as follows:
           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;         /* NULL-terminated array of pointers
                                          to names of group members */
           };
       For more information about the fields of this structure, see
       group(5).
       The getgrnam_r() and getgrgid_r() functions obtain the same informa‚Äê
       tion as getgrnam() and getgrgid(), but store the retrieved group
       structure in the space pointed to by grp.  The string fields pointed
       to by the members of the group structure are stored in the buffer buf
       of size buflen.  A pointer to the result (in case of success) or NULL
       (in case no entry was found or an error occurred) is stored in
       *result.
       The call
           sysconf(_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX)
       returns either -1, without changing errno, or an initial suggested
       size for buf.  (If this size is too small, the call fails with
       ERANGE, in which case the caller can retry with a larger buffer.)
