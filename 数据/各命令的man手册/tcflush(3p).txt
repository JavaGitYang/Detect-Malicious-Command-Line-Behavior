       Upon successful completion, tcflush() shall discard data written to
       the object referred to by fildes (an open file descriptor associated
       with a terminal) but not transmitted, or data received but not read,
       depending on the value of queue_selector:
        *  If queue_selector is TCIFLUSH, it shall flush data received but
           not read.
        *  If queue_selector is TCOFLUSH, it shall flush data written but
           not transmitted.
        *  If queue_selector is TCIOFLUSH, it shall flush both data received
           but not read and data written but not transmitted.
       Attempts to use tcflush() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
       ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
       operation, and no signal is sent.
