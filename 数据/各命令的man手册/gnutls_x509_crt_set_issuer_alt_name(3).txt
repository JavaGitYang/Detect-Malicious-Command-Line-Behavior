       This function will set the issuer alternative name certificate
       extension. It can set the same types as
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name().
       Since version 3.5.7 the GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME, GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME,
       and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP are converted to ACE format when
       necessary.
