       These routines manipulate the current attributes of the named window,
       which then apply to all characters that are written into the window
       with waddch, waddstr and wprintw.  Attributes are a property of the
       character, and move with the character through any scrolling and
       insert/delete line/character operations.  To the extent possible,
       they are displayed as appropriate modifications to the graphic
       rendition of characters put on the screen.
       These routines do not affect the attributes used when erasing
       portions of the window.  See curs_bkgd(3X) for functions which modify
       the attributes used for erasing and clearing.
       Routines which do not have a WINDOW* parameter apply to stdscr.  For
       example, attr_set is the stdscr variant of wattr_set.
   Window attributes
       There are two sets of functions:
       路   functions for manipulating the window attributes and color:
           wattr_set and wattr_get.
       路   functions for manipulating only the window attributes (not
           color): wattr_on and wattr_off.
       The wattr_set function sets the current attributes of the given
       window to attrs, with color specified by pair.
       Use wattr_get to retrieve attributes for the given window.
       Use attr_on and wattr_on to turn on window attributes, i.e., values
       OR'd together in attr, without affecting other attributes.  Use
       attr_off and wattr_off to turn off window attributes, again values
       OR'd together in attr, without affecting other attributes.
   Legacy window attributes
       The X/Open window attribute routines which set or get, turn on or off
       are extensions of older routines which assume that color pairs are
       OR'd into the attribute parameter.  These newer routines use similar
       names, because X/Open simply added an underscore (_) for the newer
       names.
       The int datatype used in the legacy routines is treated as if it is
       the same size as chtype (used by addch(3X)).  It holds the common
       video attributes (such as bold, reverse), as well as a few bits for
       color.  Those bits correspond to the A_COLOR symbol.  The COLOR_PAIR
       macro provides a value which can be OR'd into the attribute
       parameter.  For example, as long as that value fits into the A_COLOR
       mask, then these calls produce similar results:
           attrset(A_BOLD | COLOR_PAIR(pair));
           attr_set(A_BOLD, pair, NULL);
       However, if the value does not fit, then the COLOR_PAIR macro uses
       only the bits that fit.  For example, because in ncurses A_COLOR has
       eight (8) bits, then COLOR_PAIR(259) is 4 (259-255).
       The PAIR_NUMBER macro extracts a pair number from an int (or chtype).
       For example, the input and output values in these statements would be
       the same:
           int value = A_BOLD | COLOR_PAIR(input);
           int output = PAIR_NUMBER(value);
       The attrset routine is a legacy feature predating SVr4 curses but
       kept in X/Open Curses for the same reason that SVr4 curses kept it:
       compatibility.
       The remaining attr* functions operate exactly like the corresponding
       attr_* functions, except that they take arguments of type int rather
       than attr_t.
       There is no corresponding attrget function as such in X/Open Curses,
       although ncurses provides getattrs (see curs_legacy(3X)).
   Change character rendition
       The routine chgat changes the attributes of a given number of
       characters starting at the current cursor location of stdscr.  It
       does not update the cursor and does not perform wrapping.  A
       character count of -1 or greater than the remaining window width
       means to change attributes all the way to the end of the current
       line.  The wchgat function generalizes this to any window; the
       mvwchgat function does a cursor move before acting.
       In these functions, the color pair argument is a color-pair index (as
       in the first argument of init_pair, see curs_color(3X)).
   Change window color
       The routine color_set sets the current color of the given window to
       the foreground/background combination described by the color pair
       parameter.
   Standout
       The routine standout is the same as attron(A_STANDOUT).  The routine
       standend is the same as attrset(A_NORMAL) or attrset(0), that is, it
       turns off all attributes.
       X/Open does not mark these "restricted", because
       路   they have well established legacy use, and
       路   there is no ambiguity about the way the attributes might be
           combined with a color pair.
