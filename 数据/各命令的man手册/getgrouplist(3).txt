       The getgrouplist() function scans the group database (see group(5))
       to obtain the list of groups that user belongs to.  Up to *ngroups of
       these groups are returned in the array groups.
       If it was not among the groups defined for user in the group
       database, then group is included in the list of groups returned by
       getgrouplist(); typically this argument is specified as the group ID
       from the password record for user.
       The ngroups argument is a value-result argument: on return it always
       contains the number of groups found for user, including group; this
       value may be greater than the number of groups stored in groups.
