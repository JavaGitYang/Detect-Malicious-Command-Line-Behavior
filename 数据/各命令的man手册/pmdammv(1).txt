       pmdammv is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       application level performance metrics using memory mapped files.  It
       offers an extremely low overhead instrumentation facility that is
       well-suited to long running, mission critical applications where it
       is desirable to have performance metrics and availability information
       permanently enabled.
       The mmv PMDA exports instrumentation that has been added to an
       application using the MMV APIs (refer to mmv_stats_init(3) and mmv(5)
       for further details).  These APIs can be called from several
       languages, including C, C++, Perl, Python, Java (via the separate
       ``Parfait'' class library) and GoLang (via the separate ``Speed''
       library).
       A brief description of the pmdammv command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named mmv.log
            is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when pmdammv is
            started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file cannot be
            created or is not writable, output is written to the standard
            error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
