       Note: avoid using these functions; use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3)
       instead.
       The tmpnam() function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid
       filename, and such that a file with this name did not exist at some
       point in time, so that naive programmers may think it a suitable name
       for a temporary file.  If the argument s is NULL, this name is
       generated in an internal static buffer and may be overwritten by the
       next call to tmpnam().  If s is not NULL, the name is copied to the
       character array (of length at least L_tmpnam) pointed to by s and the
       value s is returned in case of success.
       The created pathname has a directory prefix P_tmpdir.  (Both L_tmpnam
       and P_tmpdir are defined in <stdio.h>, just like the TMP_MAX
       mentioned below.)
       The tmpnam_r() function performs the same task as tmpnam(), but
       returns NULL (to indicate an error) if s is NULL.
