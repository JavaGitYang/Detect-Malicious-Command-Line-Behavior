       lxc-unshare can be used to run a task in a cloned set of namespaces.
       This command is mainly provided for testing purposes.  Despite its
       name, it always uses clone rather than unshare to create the new task
       with fresh namespaces. Apart from testing kernel regressions this
       should make no difference.
