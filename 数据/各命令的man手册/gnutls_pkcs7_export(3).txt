       This function will export the pkcs7 structure to DER or PEM format.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *
       output_data_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned.
       If the structure is PEM encoded, it will have a header of "BEGIN
       PKCS7".
