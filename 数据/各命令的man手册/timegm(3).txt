       The functions timelocal() and timegm() are the inverses of
       localtime(3) and gmtime(3).  Both functions take a broken-down time
       and convert it to calendar time (seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01
       00:00:00 +0000, UTC).  The difference between the two functions is
       that timelocal() takes the local timezone into account when doing the
       conversion, while timegm() takes the input value to be Coordinated
       Universal Time (UTC).
