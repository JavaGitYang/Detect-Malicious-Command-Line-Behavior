       The dlerror() function shall return a null-terminated character
       string (with no trailing <newline>) that describes the last error
       that occurred during dynamic linking processing. If no dynamic
       linking errors have occurred since the last invocation of dlerror(),
       dlerror() shall return NULL.  Thus, invoking dlerror() a second time,
       immediately following a prior invocation, shall result in NULL being
       returned.
       It is implementation-defined whether or not the dlerror() function is
       thread-safe. A thread-safe implementation shall return only errors
       that occur on the current thread.
