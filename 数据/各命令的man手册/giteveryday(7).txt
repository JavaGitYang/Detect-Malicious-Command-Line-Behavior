       Git users can broadly be grouped into four categories for the
       purposes of describing here a small set of useful command for
       everyday Git.
       ·   Individual Developer (Standalone) commands are essential for
           anybody who makes a commit, even for somebody who works alone.
       ·   If you work with other people, you will need commands listed in
           the Individual Developer (Participant) section as well.
       ·   People who play the Integrator role need to learn some more
           commands in addition to the above.
       ·   Repository Administration commands are for system administrators
           who are responsible for the care and feeding of Git repositories.
