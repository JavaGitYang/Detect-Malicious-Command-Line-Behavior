       The dmstats program manages IO statistics regions for devices that
       use the device-mapper driver. Statistics regions may be created,
       deleted, listed and reported on using the tool.
       The first argument to dmstats is a command.
       The second argument is the device name, uuid or major and minor
       numbers.
       Further options permit the selection of regions, output format
       control, and reporting behaviour.
       When no device argument is given dmstats will by default operate on
       all device-mapper devices present. The create and delete commands
       require the use of --alldevices when used in this way.
