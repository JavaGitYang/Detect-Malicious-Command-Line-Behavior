       The Attribute Uniqueness overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as slapd-bdb(5) to enforce the uniqueness of some or all
       attributes within a scope. This subtree defaults to all objects
       within the subtree of the database for which the Uniqueness overlay
       is configured.
       Uniqueness is enforced by searching the subtree to ensure that the
       values of all attributes presented with an add, modify or modrdn
       operation are unique within the scope.  For example, if uniqueness
       were enforced for the uid attribute, the subtree would be searched
       for any other records which also have a uid attribute containing the
       same value. If any are found, the request is rejected.
       The search is performed using the rootdn of the database, to avoid
       issues with ACLs preventing the overlay from seeing all of the
       relevant data. As such, the database must have a rootdn configured.
