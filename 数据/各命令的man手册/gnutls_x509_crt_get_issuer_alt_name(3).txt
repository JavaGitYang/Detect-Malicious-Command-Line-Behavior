       This function retrieves the Issuer Alternative Name (2.5.29.18),
       contained in the given certificate in the X509v3 Certificate
       Extensions.
       When the SAN type is otherName, it will extract the data in the
       otherName's value field, and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME is returned.  You
       may use gnutls_x509_crt_get_subject_alt_othername_oid() to get the
       corresponding OID and the "virtual" SAN types (e.g.,
       GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP).
       If an otherName OID is known, the data will be decoded.  Otherwise
       the returned data will be DER encoded, and you will have to decode it
       yourself.  Currently, only the RFC 3920 id-on-xmppAddr Issuer AltName
       is recognized.
