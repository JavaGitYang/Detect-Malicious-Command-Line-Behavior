       The posix_spawnattr_getflags() function shall obtain the value of the
       spawn-flags attribute from the attributes object referenced by attr.
       The posix_spawnattr_setflags() function shall set the spawn-flags
       attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.
       The spawn-flags attribute is used to indicate which process
       attributes are to be changed in the new process image when invoking
       posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp().  It is the bitwise-inclusive OR of
       zero or more of the following flags:
       POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER
       These flags are defined in <spawn.h>.  The default value of this
       attribute shall be as if no flags were set.
