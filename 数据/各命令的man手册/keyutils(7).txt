       The keyutils package is a library and a set of utilities for
       accessing the kernel keyrings facility.
       A header file is supplied to provide the definitions and declarations
       required to access the library:
              #include <keyutils.h>
       To link with the library, the following:
              -lkeyutils
       should be specified to the linker.
       Three system calls are provided:
       add_key(2)
              Supply a new key to the kernel.
       request_key(2)
              Find an existing key for use, or, optionally, create one if
              one does not exist.
       keyctl(2)
              Control a key in various ways.  The library provides a variety
              of wrappers around this system call and those should be used
              rather than calling it directly.
       See the add_key(2), request_key(2), and keyctl(2) manual pages for
       more information.
       The keyctl() wrappers are listed on the keyctl(3) manual page.
