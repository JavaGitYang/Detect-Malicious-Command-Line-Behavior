       The thread keyring is a keyring used to anchor keys on behalf of a
       process.  It is created only when a thread requests it.  The thread
       keyring has the name (description) _tid.
       A special serial number value, KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING, is defined
       that can be used in lieu of the actual serial number of the calling
       thread's thread keyring.
       From the keyctl(1) utility, '@t' can be used instead of a numeric key
       ID in much the same way, but as keyctl(1) is a program run after
       forking, this is of no utility.
       Thread keyrings are not inherited across clone(2) and fork(2) and are
       cleared by execve(2).  A thread keyring is destroyed when the thread
       that refers to it terminates.
       Initially, a thread does not have a thread keyring.  If a thread
       doesn't have a thread keyring when it is accessed, then it will be
       created if it is to be modified; otherwise the operation fails with
       the error ENOKEY.
