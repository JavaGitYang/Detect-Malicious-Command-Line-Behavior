       The LDAP Data Interchange Format (LDIF) is used to represent LDAP
       entries and change records in text form. LDAP tools, such as
       ldapadd(1) and ldapsearch(1), read and write LDIF entry records.
       ldapmodify(1) reads LDIF change records.
       This manual page provides a basic description of LDIF.  A formal
       specification of LDIF is published in RFC 2849.
