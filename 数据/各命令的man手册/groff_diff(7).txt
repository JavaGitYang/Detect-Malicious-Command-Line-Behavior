       This manual page describes the language differences between groff,
       the GNU roff text processing system, and the classical roff formatter
       of the freely available Unix 7 of the 1970s, documented in the Troff
       User's Manual by Ossanna and Kernighan.  This includes the roff
       language as well as the intermediate output format (troff output).
       The section SEE ALSO gives pointers to both the classical roff and
       the modern groff documentation.
