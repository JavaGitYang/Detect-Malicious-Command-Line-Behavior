       The current reporting timezone effects the timezone used by
       pmCtime(3) and pmLocaltime(3).
       pmWhichZone returns the handle of the current timezone, as previously
       established by a call to pmNewZone(3) or pmNewContextZone(3).  If the
       call is successful (i.e. there exists a current reporting timezone)
       then a non-negative integer is returned and tz is set to point to a
       static buffer containing the timezone string itself.
