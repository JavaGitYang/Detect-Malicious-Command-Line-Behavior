       sctp_getladdrs returns all locally bound addresses on a socket. On
       return, addrs will point to a dynamically allocated packed array of
       sockaddr structures of the appropriate type for each local address.
       The caller should use sctp_freeladdrs to free the memory. Note that
       the in/out parameter addrs must not be NULL.
       If sd is an IPv4 socket, the addresses returned will be all IPv4
       addresses. If sd is an IPv6 socket, the addresses returned can be a
       mix of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
       For one-to-many style sockets, id specifies the association to query.
       For one-to-one style sockets, id is ignored.
       If the id field is set to 0, then the locally bound addresses are
       returned without regard to any particular association.
       sctp_freeladdrs frees all the resources allocated by sctp_getladdrs
