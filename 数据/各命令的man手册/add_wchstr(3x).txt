       These functions copy the (null-terminated) array of complex
       characters wchstr into the window image structure starting at the
       current cursor position.  The four functions with n as the last
       argument copy at most n elements, but no more than will fit on the
       line.  If n=-1 then the whole array is copied, to the maximum number
       of characters that will fit on the line.
       The window cursor is not advanced.  These functions work faster than
       waddnstr.  On the other hand:
       路   they do not perform checking (such as for the newline, backspace,
           or carriage return characters),
       路   they do not advance the current cursor position,
       路   they do not expand other control characters to ^-escapes, and
       路   they truncate the string if it crosses the right margin, rather
           than wrapping it around to the new line.
       These functions end successfully on encountering a null cchar_t, or
       when they have filled the current line.  If a complex character
       cannot completely fit at the end of the current line, the remaining
       columns are filled with the background character and rendition.
