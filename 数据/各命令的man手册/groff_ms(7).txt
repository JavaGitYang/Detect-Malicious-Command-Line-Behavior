       This manual page describes the GNU version of the ms macros, part of
       the groff typesetting system.  The ms macros are mostly compatible
       with the documented behavior of the 4.3 BSD Unix ms macros (see
       Differences from troff ms below for details).  The ms macros are
       suitable for reports, letters, books, and technical documentation.
