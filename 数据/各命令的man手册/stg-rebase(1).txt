       Pop all patches from current stack, move the stack base to the given
       <new-base-id> and push the patches back.
       If you experience merge conflicts, resolve the problem and continue
       the rebase by executing the following sequence:
           $ git add --update
           $ stg refresh
           $ stg goto top-patch
       Or if you want to skip that patch:
           $ stg undo --hard
           $ stg push next-patch..top-patch
