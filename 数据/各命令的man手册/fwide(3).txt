       When mode is zero, the fwide() function determines the current
       orientation of stream.  It returns a positive value if stream is
       wide-character oriented, that is, if wide-character I/O is permitted
       but char I/O is disallowed.  It returns a negative value if stream is
       byte orientedâ€”that is, if char I/O is permitted but wide-character
       I/O is disallowed.  It returns zero if stream has no orientation yet;
       in this case the next I/O operation might change the orientation (to
       byte oriented if it is a char I/O operation, or to wide-character
       oriented if it is a wide-character I/O operation).
       Once a stream has an orientation, it cannot be changed and persists
       until the stream is closed.
       When mode is nonzero, the fwide() function first attempts to set
       stream's orientation (to wide-character oriented if mode is greater
       than 0, or to byte oriented if mode is less than 0).  It then returns
       a value denoting the current orientation, as above.
