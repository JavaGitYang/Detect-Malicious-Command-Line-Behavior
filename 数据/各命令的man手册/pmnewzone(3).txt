       The current reporting timezone affects the timezone used by
       pmCtime(3) and pmLocaltime(3).
       The argument tz defines a timezone string, in the format described
       for the TZ environment variable, see environ(7).
       pmNewZone sets the current reporting timezone, and returns a value
       that may be used in a subsequent call to pmUseZone(3) to restore this
       reporting timezone.
