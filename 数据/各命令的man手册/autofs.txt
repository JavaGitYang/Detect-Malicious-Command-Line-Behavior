       Configuration settings used by automount(8) may be changed in the
       configuration file @mapdir@/autofs.conf.
       This file contains two primary sections, autofs and amd.
       Configuration entries may be present at the beginning of the
       configuration file without a section header and are implicitly
       included as part of the autofs section.
       Each section name is enclosed in square brackets with spaces between
       the brackets and the section name. The amd section may be followed by
       further sections, named by the top level mount point path, that
       contain per mount configuration settings.
