       The aio_error() function shall return the error status associated
       with the aiocb structure referenced by the aiocbp argument. The error
       status for an asynchronous I/O operation is the errno value that
       would be set by the corresponding read(), write(), fdatasync(), or
       fsync() operation. If the operation has not yet completed, then the
       error status shall be equal to [EINPROGRESS].
       If the aiocb structure pointed to by aiocbp is not associated with an
       operation that has been scheduled, the results are undefined.
