       The shutdown() function shall cause all or part of a full-duplex
       connection on the socket associated with the file descriptor socket
       to be shut down.
       The shutdown() function takes the following arguments:
       socket      Specifies the file descriptor of the socket.
       how         Specifies the type of shutdown. The values are as
                   follows:
                   SHUT_RD     Disables further receive operations.
                   SHUT_WR     Disables further send operations.
                   SHUT_RDWR   Disables further send and receive operations.
       The shutdown() function disables subsequent send and/or receive
       operations on a socket, depending on the value of the how argument.
