       Slapschema is used to check schema compliance of the contents of a
       slapd(8) database.  It opens the given database determined by the
       database number or suffix and checks the compliance of its contents
       with the corresponding schema. Errors are written to standard output
       or the specified file.  Databases configured as subordinate of this
       one are also output, unless -g is specified.
       Administrators may need to modify existing schema items, including
       adding new required attributes to objectClasses, removing existing
       required or allowed attributes from objectClasses, entirely removing
       objectClasses, or any other change that may result in making
       perfectly valid entries no longer compliant with the modified schema.
       The execution of the slapschema tool after modifying the schema can
       point out inconsistencies that would otherwise surface only when
       inconsistent entries need to be modified.
       The entry records are checked in database order, not superior first
       order.  The entry records will be checked considering all (user and
       operational) attributes stored in the database.  Dynamically
       generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry) will not be
       considered.
