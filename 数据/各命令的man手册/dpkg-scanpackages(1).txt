       dpkg-scanpackages sorts through a tree of Debian binary packages and
       creates a Packages file, used by apt(8), dselect(1), etc, to tell the
       user what packages are available for installation. These Packages
       files are the same as those found on Debian archive sites and CD-
       ROMs. You might use dpkg-scanpackages yourself if making a directory
       of local packages to install on a cluster of machines.
       Note: If you want to access the generated Packages file with apt you
       will probably need to compress the file with xz(1) (generating a
       Packages.xz file), bzip2(1) (generating a Packages.bz2 file) or
       gzip(1) (generating a Packages.gz file). apt ignores uncompressed
       Packages files except on local access (i.e.  file:// sources).
       binary-path is the name of the tree of the binary packages to process
       (for example, contrib/binary-i386).  It is best to make this relative
       to the root of the Debian archive, because every Filename field in
       the new Packages file will start with this string.
       override-file is the name of a file to read which contains
       information about how the package fits into the distribution (the
       file can be compressed since dpkg 1.15.5); see deb-override(5).
       path-prefix is an optional string to be prepended to the Filename
       fields.
       If more than one version of a package is found only the newest one is
       included in the output. If they have the same version and only differ
       in architecture only the first one found is used.
