       This function will renegotiate security parameters with the client.
       This should only be called in case of a server.
       This message informs the peer that we want to renegotiate parameters
       (perform a handshake).
       If this function succeeds (returns 0), you must call the
       gnutls_handshake() function in order to negotiate the new parameters.
       Since TLS is full duplex some application data might have been sent
       during peer's processing of this message. In that case one should
       call gnutls_record_recv() until GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE is returned to
       clear any pending data. Care must be taken, if rehandshake is
       mandatory, to terminate if it does not start after some threshold.
       If the client does not wish to renegotiate parameters he should reply
       with an alert message, thus the return code will be
       GNUTLS_E_WARNING_ALERT_RECEIVED and the alert will be
       GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION.  A client may also choose to ignore this
       message.
