       "perf mem record" runs a command and gathers memory operation data
       from it, into perf.data. Perf record options are accepted and are
       passed through.
       "perf mem report" displays the result. It invokes perf report with
       the right set of options to display a memory access profile. By
       default, loads and stores are sampled. Use the -t option to limit to
       loads or stores.
       Note that on Intel systems the memory latency reported is the
       use-latency, not the pure load (or store latency). Use latency
       includes any pipeline queueing delays in addition to the memory
       subsystem latency.
