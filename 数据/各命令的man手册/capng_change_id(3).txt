       This function will change uid and gid to the ones given while
       retaining the capabilities previously specified in capng_update. It
       is not necessary and perhaps better if capng_apply has not been
       called prior to this function so that all necessary privileges are
       still intact. The caller is required to have CAP_SETPCAP capability
       still active before calling this function.
       This function also takes a flag parameter that helps to tailor the
       exact actions performed by the function to secure the environment.
       The option may be or'ed together. The legal values are:
              CAPNG_NO_FLAG
                     Simply change uid and retain specified capabilities and
                     that's all.
              CAPNG_DROP_SUPP_GRP
                     After changing id, remove any supplement groups that
                     may still be in effect from the old uid.
              CAPNG_INIT_SUPP_GRP
                     After changing id, initialize any supplement groups
                     that may come with the new account. If given with
                     CAPNG_DROP_SUPP_GRP it will have no effect.
              CAPNG_CLEAR_BOUNDING
                     After changing the uid and gid, clear the bounding set
                     regardless to the internal representation already
                     setup.
