       Verify signature of the Basic OCSP Response against the public key in
       the certificate of a trusted signer.  The  trustlist should be
       populated with trust anchors.  The function will extract the signer
       certificate from the Basic OCSP Response and will verify it against
       the  trustlist .  A trusted signer is a certificate that is either in
       trustlist , or it is signed directly by a certificate in
        trustlist and has the id-ad-ocspSigning Extended Key Usage bit set.
       The output  verify variable will hold verification status codes
       (e.g., GNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_SIGNER_NOT_FOUND,
       GNUTLS_OCSP_VERIFY_INSECURE_ALGORITHM) which are only valid if the
       function returned GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS.
       Note that the function returns GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS even when
       verification failed.  The caller must always inspect the  verify
       variable to find out the verification status.
       The  flags variable should be 0 for now.
