       pmsignal provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for use
       with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit.  It can be used to
       send a named signal (only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are accepted) to
       one or more processes.
       The processes are specified directly using PIDs or as program names
       (with either the -a/--all or -p/--program options).  In the all case,
       the set of all running processes is searched for a basename(1) match
       on name.  In the program case, process identifiers are extracted from
       files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directrory where file names are matched on
       name.pid.
       The -n/--dry-run option reports the list of process identifiers that
       would have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.
       If a signal is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent.  The
       list of supported signals is reported when using the -l/--list
       option.
       On Linux and UNIX platforms, pmsignal is a simple wrapper around the
       kill(1) command.  On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to this
       mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism has been implemented - this
       is only honoured by PCP tools, however, not all Windows utilities.
