       If this function is called with the GNUTLS_HB_PEER_ALLOWED_TO_SEND
        type , GnuTLS will allow heartbeat messages to be received. Moreover
       it also request the peer to accept heartbeat messages. This function
       must be called prior to TLS handshake.
       If the  type used is GNUTLS_HB_LOCAL_ALLOWED_TO_SEND, then the peer
       will be asked to accept heartbeat messages but not send ones.
       The function gnutls_heartbeat_allowed() can be used to test Whether
       locally generated heartbeat messages can be accepted by the peer.
