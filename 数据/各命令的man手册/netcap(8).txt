       netcap is a program that prints out a report of process capabilities.
       If the application is using tcp, udp, raw, or packet family of
       sockets AND has any capabilities, it will be in the report. If the
       process has partial capabilities, it is further examined to see if it
       has an open-ended bounding set. If this is found to be true, a '+'
       symbol is added.
       Some directories in the /proc file system are readonly by root. The
       program will try to access and report what it can. But if nothing
       comes out, try changing to the root user and re-run this program.
