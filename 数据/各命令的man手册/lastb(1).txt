       last looks through the file wtmp (which records all logins/logouts)
       and prints information about connect times of users. Records are
       printed from most recent to least recent.  Records can be specified
       by tty and username.  tty names can be abbreviated:
                                      last 0
       is equivalent to
                                    last tty0.
       Multiple arguments can be specified:
                                 last root console
       will print all of the entries for the user root and all entries
       logged in on the console tty.
       The special users reboot and shutdown log in when the system reboots
       or (surprise) shuts down.
                                    last reboot
       will produce a record of reboot times.
       If last is interrupted by a quit signal, it prints out how far its
       search in the wtmp file had reached and then quits.
