       gdiffmk compares two groff(1), nroff(1), or troff(1) documents, file1
       and file2, and creates an output which is file2 with added “margin
       character” (.mc) commands that indicate the differences.
       If the output filename is present, the output is written there.  If
       it is - or absent the output is written to the standard output.
       If the file1 or file2 argument is - the standard input is read for
       that input.  Clearly both cannot be -.
       Note that the output is not necessarily compatible with all macro
       packages and all preprocessors.  See the BUGS section below.
