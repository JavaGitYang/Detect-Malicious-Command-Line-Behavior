       Run COMMAND with an adjusted niceness, which affects process
       scheduling.  With no COMMAND, print the current niceness.  Niceness
       values range from -20 (most favorable to the process) to 19 (least
       favorable to the process).
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.
       -n, --adjustment=N
              add integer N to the niceness (default 10)
       --help display this help and exit
       --version
              output version information and exit
       NOTE: your shell may have its own version of nice, which usually
       supersedes the version described here.  Please refer to your shell's
       documentation for details about the options it supports.
