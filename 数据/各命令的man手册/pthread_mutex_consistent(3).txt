       This function makes a robust mutex consistent if it is in an
       inconsistent state.  A mutex can be left in an inconsistent state if
       its owner terminates while holding the mutex, in which case the next
       owner who acquires the mutex will succeed and be notified by a return
       value of EOWNERDEAD from a call to pthread_mutex_lock().
