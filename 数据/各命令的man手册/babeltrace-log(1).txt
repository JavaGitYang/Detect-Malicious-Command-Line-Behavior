       The babeltrace-log tool reads the lines of a Linux kernel ring
       buffer, as printed by the dmesg(1) tool, from the standard input
       stream and converts them to a CTF (see <http://diamon.org/ctf/>)
       trace written to the OUTPUT-PATH directory.
       Usage example:
           $ dmesg | babeltrace-log --with-timestamps my-trace
       The events of the generated CTF trace are named string and contain a
       single payload string field named str which contains the
       corresponding ring buffer line.
       By default, babeltrace-log does not try to extract the timestamps of
       the kernel ring buffer lines to use them as the created eventsâ€™s
       timestamps. A typical dmesg(1) line looks like this:
           [87166.510937] PM: Finishing wakeup.
       In the last example, the [87166.510937] part is a timestamp which
       could be extracted. You can make babeltrace-log extract timestamps
       from lines with the --with-timestamps option.
