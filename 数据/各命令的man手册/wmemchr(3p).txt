       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wmemchr() function shall locate the first occurrence of wc in the
       initial n wide characters of the object pointed to by ws.  This
       function shall not be affected by locale and all wchar_t values shall
       be treated identically. The null wide character and wchar_t values
       not corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated specially.
       If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws is a valid pointer
       and the function behaves as if no valid occurrence of wc is found.
