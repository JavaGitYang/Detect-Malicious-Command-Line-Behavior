       The getgrent() function shall return a pointer to a structure
       containing the broken-out fields of an entry in the group database.
       When first called, getgrent() shall return a pointer to a group
       structure containing the first entry in the group database.
       Thereafter, it shall return a pointer to a group structure containing
       the next group structure in the group database, so successive calls
       may be used to search the entire database.
       An implementation that provides extended security controls may impose
       further implementation-defined restrictions on accessing the group
       database. In particular, the system may deny the existence of some or
       all of the group database entries associated with groups other than
       those groups associated with the caller and may omit users other than
       the caller from the list of members of groups in database entries
       that are returned.
       The setgrent() function shall rewind the group database to allow
       repeated searches.
       The endgrent() function may be called to close the group database
       when processing is complete.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
