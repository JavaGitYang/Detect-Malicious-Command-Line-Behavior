       If the application wants to force using a local Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS) instead of a distributed PMNS then it must load the
       PMNS using pmLoadASCIINameSpace or pmLoadNameSpace(3).  If the
       application wants to use a distributed PMNS, then it should NOT make
       a call to load the PMNS explicitly.
       Most applications using a Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) context (of any type, so PM_CONTEXT_HOST or
       PM_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE or PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL) should not need to call
       pmLoadASCIINameSpace.
       The filename argument designates the PMNS of interest.  For
       applications not requiring a tailored PMNS, the special value
       PM_NS_DEFAULT may be used for filename, to force the default local
       PMNS to be loaded.
       The default local PMNS is found in the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root
       unless the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT is set, in which case
       the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file containing the
       default local PMNS.
       pmLoadASCIINameSpace is a variant of pmLoadNameSpace(3) in which the
       dupok argument may be used to control the handling of multiple names
       in the PMNS that may be associated with a single Performance Metric
       Identifier (PMID).  A value of 0 disallows duplicates, any other
       value allows duplicates and the latter is the default behaviour of
       pmLoadNameSpace(3) as of Version 3.10.3 of PCP.
       The other difference is that when pmLoadASCIINameSpace is used and
       filename is not PM_NS_DEFAULT, the PMNS file will always be pre-
       processed with pmcpp(1) as described in pmns(5).  This allows a PMNS
       file that contains C-style comments, pre-processor directives or
       macros to be processed correctly before the PMNS is parsed.
       pmLoadASCIINameSpace returns zero on success.
