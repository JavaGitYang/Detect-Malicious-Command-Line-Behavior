       dh_link is a debhelper program that creates symlinks in package build
       directories.
       dh_link accepts a list of pairs of source and destination files. The
       source files are the already existing files that will be symlinked
       from (called target by ln(1)). The destination files are the symlinks
       that will be created (called link name by ln(1)). There must be an
       equal number of source and destination files specified.
       Be sure you do specify the absolute path to both the source and
       destination files (unlike you would do if you were using something
       like ln(1)).  Please note that the leading slash is optional.
       dh_link will generate symlinks that comply with Debian policy -
       absolute when policy says they should be absolute, and relative links
       with as short a path as possible. It will also create any
       subdirectories it needs to put the symlinks in.
       Any pre-existing destination files will be replaced with symlinks.
       dh_link also scans the package build tree for existing symlinks which
       do not conform to Debian policy, and corrects them (v4 or later).
