       The shmat() function operates on XSI shared memory (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Section 3.342, Shared Memory
       Object).  It is unspecified whether this function interoperates with
       the realtime interprocess communication facilities defined in Section
       2.8, Realtime.
       The shmat() function attaches the shared memory segment associated
       with the shared memory identifier specified by shmid to the address
       space of the calling process. The segment is attached at the address
       specified by one of the following criteria:
        *  If shmaddr is a null pointer, the segment is attached at the
           first available address as selected by the system.
        *  If shmaddr is not a null pointer and (shmflg &SHM_RND) is non-
           zero, the segment is attached at the address given by (shmaddr
           −((uintptr_t)shmaddr %SHMLBA)). The character '%' is the C-
           language remainder operator.
        *  If shmaddr is not a null pointer and (shmflg &SHM_RND) is 0, the
           segment is attached at the address given by shmaddr.
        *  The segment is attached for reading if (shmflg &SHM_RDONLY) is
           non-zero and the calling process has read permission; otherwise,
           if it is 0 and the calling process has read and write permission,
           the segment is attached for reading and writing.
