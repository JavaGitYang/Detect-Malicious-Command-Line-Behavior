       The posix_trace_close() function shall deallocate the trace log
       identifier indicated by trid, and all of its associated resources. If
       there is no valid trace log pointed to by the trid, this function
       shall fail.
       The posix_trace_open() function shall allocate the necessary
       resources and establish the connection between a trace log identified
       by the file_desc argument and a trace stream identifier identified by
       the object pointed to by the trid argument. The file_desc argument
       should be a valid open file descriptor that corresponds to a trace
       log. The file_desc argument shall be open for reading. The current
       trace event timestamp, which specifies the timestamp of the trace
       event that will be read by the next call to
       posix_trace_getnext_event(), shall be set to the timestamp of the
       oldest trace event recorded in the trace log identified by trid.
       The posix_trace_open() function shall return a trace stream
       identifier in the variable pointed to by the trid argument, that may
       only be used by the following functions:
       posix_trace_close()                      posix_trace_get_attr()
       posix_trace_eventid_equal()              posix_trace_get_status()
       posix_trace_eventid_get_name()           posix_trace_getnext_event()
       posix_trace_eventtypelist_getnext_id()   posix_trace_rewind()
       posix_trace_eventtypelist_rewind()
       In particular, notice that the operations normally used by a trace
       controller process, such as posix_trace_start(), posix_trace_stop(),
       or posix_trace_shutdown(), cannot be invoked using the trace stream
       identifier returned by the posix_trace_open() function.
       The posix_trace_rewind() function shall reset the current trace event
       timestamp, which specifies the timestamp of the trace event that will
       be read by the next call to posix_trace_getnext_event(), to the
       timestamp of the oldest trace event recorded in the trace log
       identified by trid.
