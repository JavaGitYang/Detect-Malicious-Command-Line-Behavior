       roff is the general name for a set of text formatting programs, known
       under names like troff, nroff, ditroff, groff, etc.  A roff system
       consists of an extensible text formatting language and a set of
       programs for printing and converting to other text formats.  Unix-
       like operating systems distribute a roff system as a core package.
       The most common roff system today is the free software implementation
       GNU roff, groff(1).  groff implements the look-and-feel and
       functionality of its ancestors, with many extensions.
       The ancestry of roff is described in section HISTORY.  In this
       document, the term roff always refers to the general class of roff
       programs, not to the roff command provided in early UNIX systems.
       In spite of its age, roff is in wide use today, for example, the
       manual pages on UNIX systems (man pages), many software books, system
       documentation, standards, and corporate documents are written in
       roff.  The roff output for text devices is still unmatched, and its
       graphical output has the same quality as other free type-setting
       programs and is better than some of the commercial systems.
       roff is used to format UNIX manual pages, (or man pages), the
       standard documentation system on many UNIX-derived operating systems.
       This document describes the history of the development of the roff
       system; some usage aspects common to all roff versions, details on
       the roff pipeline, which is usually hidden behind front-ends like
       groff(1); a general overview of the formatting language; some tips
       for editing roff files; and many pointers to further readings.
