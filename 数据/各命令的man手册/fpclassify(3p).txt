       The fpclassify() macro shall classify its argument value as NaN,
       infinite, normal, subnormal, zero, or into another implementation-
       defined category.  First, an argument represented in a format wider
       than its semantic type is converted to its semantic type. Then
       classification is based on the type of the argument.
