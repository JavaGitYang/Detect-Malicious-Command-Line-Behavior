       The aio_cancel() function shall attempt to cancel one or more
       asynchronous I/O requests currently outstanding against file
       descriptor fildes.  The aiocbp argument points to the asynchronous
       I/O control block for a particular request to be canceled. If aiocbp
       is NULL, then all outstanding cancelable asynchronous I/O requests
       against fildes shall be canceled.
       Normal asynchronous notification shall occur for asynchronous I/O
       operations that are successfully canceled. If there are requests that
       cannot be canceled, then the normal asynchronous completion process
       shall take place for those requests when they are completed.
       For requested operations that are successfully canceled, the
       associated error status shall be set to [ECANCELED] and the return
       status shall be âˆ’1. For requested operations that are not
       successfully canceled, the aiocbp shall not be modified by
       aio_cancel().
       If aiocbp is not NULL, then if fildes does not have the same value as
       the file descriptor with which the asynchronous operation was
       initiated, unspecified results occur.
       Which operations are cancelable is implementation-defined.
