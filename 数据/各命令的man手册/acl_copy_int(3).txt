     The acl_copy_int() function copies an exportable, contiguous, persis‐
     tent form of an ACL, pointed to by buf_p, to the internal representa‐
     tion.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‐
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_copy_int() as an
     argument.
