       These functions form part of the Performance Metrics Applications
       Programming Interface (PMAPI) and are intended to provide a uniform
       mechanism for applications to both replay archive data and report
       live data in a time synchronized manner.
       The pmTime structure has the following fields:
         typedef struct {
             unsigned int        magic;
             unsigned int        length;
             pm_tctl_command     command;
             pm_tctl_source      source;
             pm_tctl_state       state;
             pm_tctl_mode        mode;
             struct timeval      delta;
             struct timeval      position;
             struct timeval      start;     /* archive only */
             struct timeval      end;       /* archive only */
             char                data[0];   /* arbitrary length info (TZ) */
         } pmTime;
       In the simplest case, the application should call pmTimeConnect to
       connect to the time control server, pmtime(1), and then repeatedly
       call pmTimeRecv in the main loop of the application.  On success,
       pmTimeConnect returns a non-negative file descriptor.  In
       applications which have multiple threads of control, rather than
       simply blocking in pmTimeRecv, the file descriptor may be used in
       calls to select(2).  In graphical applications, the file descriptor
       may be used to interface with the event loop.
       The port parameter to pmTimeConnect is the port number of the socket
       on which the time control server is (or will be) listening for new
       connections.
       The state parameter to pmTimeConnect is used to initialize a new time
       control server or to pass additional information to an existing time
       control server.  The start and finish fields indicate the
       chronological bounds interesting to the application.  The showdialog
       field indicates whether the time control server should initially show
       or hide the dialog.  The position, delta, and data fields indicate
       the initial archive position, update interval, time zone string and
       time zone label string.
       pmTimeRecv blocks until the time control server sends a command
       message.  It then updates the state parameter and returns one of the
       PM_TCTL command identifiers.
       The PM_TCTL_SET command indicates the application should seek to the
       archive position (see pmSetMode(3)) returned in the position field of
       the state parameter.
       The PM_TCTL_STEP command indicates the application should perform an
       update, i.e. advance (or rewind, if delta is negative) to the time
       indicated by position and then fetch new metric values, update the
       display or whatever.  In order for several application to remain
       synchronized, the time control server will wait until all
       applications have acknowledged that they have completed the step
       command.  Applications should call pmTimeSendAck when the step
       command has been processed.  Note that PM_TCTL_STEP is the only
       command that requires an explicit acknowledgement.
       The PM_TCTL_VCRMODE command is used by the time control server to
       indicate the current VCR mode.
       The value is returned in the vcrmode field of the state parameter
       passed to pmTimeRecv, and remains valid until the next
       PM_TCTL_VCRMODE command is received.
       The PM_TCTL_TZ command indicates the application should use a new
       time- zone, as indicated in the tz and tzlabel fields of the state
       parameter.
       The PM_TCTL_BOUNDS command is sent to all applications when the time
       control server changes its chronological bounds.  This may occur when
       a new application connects to the time control server or the user
       changes the bounds manually.  Most applications will ignore this
       command.
       The PM_TCTL_SHOWDIALOG command will be sent to all applications when
       the visibility of the time control server changes.  This allows
       applications to alter the text in menus or buttons to reflect this
       change.  Applications may change the visibility of the time control
       dialog using the pmTimeShowDialog function.  The initial visibility
       is determined when the time control dialog is first created by an
       application calling pmTimeConnect with the showdialog field in the
       state parameter set to the desired value.
       The pmTimeDisconnect function may be used to close the command socket
       to the time control server.  This is useful when applications need to
       change the connection mode, e.g. to divorce the current time control
       server and connect to a new one.
