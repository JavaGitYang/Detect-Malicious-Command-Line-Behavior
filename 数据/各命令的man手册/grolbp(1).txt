       grolbp is a driver for groff that produces output in CAPSL and VDM
       format suitable for Canon LBP-4 and LBP-8 printers.
       For compatibility with grolj4 there is an additional drawing command
       available:
       \D'R dh dv'
              Draw a rule (i.e. a solid black rectangle), with one corner at
              the current position, and the diagonally opposite corner at
              the current position +(dh,dv).
