     The acl_get_permset() function returns in permset_p a descriptor to the
     permission set in the ACL entry indicated by entry_d.  Subsequent oper‐
     ations using the returned permission set descriptor operate on the per‐
     mission set within the ACL entry.
     Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to the entry referred to by
     entry_d shall continue to refer to those entries.
