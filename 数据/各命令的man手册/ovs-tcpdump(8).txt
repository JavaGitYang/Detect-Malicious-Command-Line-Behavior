       ovs-tcpdump creates switch mirror ports in the ovs-vswitchd daemon
       and executes tcpdump to listen against those ports. When the tcpdump
       instance exits, it then cleans up the mirror port it created.
       ovs-tcpdump will not allow multiple mirrors for the same port. It has
       some logic to parse the current configuration and prevent duplicate
       mirrors.
       The -i option may not appear multiple times.
       It is important to note that under Linux based kernels, tap devices
       do not receive packets unless the specific tuntap device has been
       opened by an application. This requires CAP_NET_ADMIN privileges, so
       the ovs-tcpdump command must be run as a user with such permissions
       (this is usually a super-user).
