       The system call setfsgid() changes the value of the caller's
       filesystem group IDâ€”the group ID that the Linux kernel uses to check
       for all accesses to the filesystem.  Normally, the value of the
       filesystem group ID will shadow the value of the effective group ID.
       In fact, whenever the effective group ID is changed, the filesystem
       group ID will also be changed to the new value of the effective group
       ID.
       Explicit calls to setfsuid(2) and setfsgid() are usually used only by
       programs such as the Linux NFS server that need to change what user
       and group ID is used for file access without a corresponding change
       in the real and effective user and group IDs.  A change in the normal
       user IDs for a program such as the NFS server is a security hole that
       can expose it to unwanted signals.  (But see below.)
       setfsgid() will succeed only if the caller is the superuser or if
       fsgid matches either the caller's real group ID, effective group ID,
       saved set-group-ID, or current the filesystem user ID.
