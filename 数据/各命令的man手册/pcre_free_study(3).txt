       This function is used to free the memory used for the data generated
       by a call to pcre[16|32]_study() when it is no longer needed. The
       argument must be the result of such a call.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
