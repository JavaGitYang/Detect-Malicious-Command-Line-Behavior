       This plugin extends yum for some commands that give aggregate package
       data based on lists of packages
       added yum commands are:
        * list-vendors
        * info-vendors
        * list-rpm-groups
        * info-rpm-groups
        * list-packagers
        * info-packagers
        * list-licenses
        * info-licenses
        * list-arches
        * info-arches
        * list-committers
        * info-committers
        * list-buildhosts
        * info-buildhosts
        * list-baseurls
        * info-baseurls
        * list-package-sizes
        * info-package-sizes
        * list-archive-sizes
        * info-archive-sizes
        * list-installed-sizes
        * info-installed-sizes
        * list-groups
        * info-groups
       all of which take the same arguments as the list and info yum
       commands. The difference between the list and info varieties is that
       the info versions lists all the packages under each aggregation.
