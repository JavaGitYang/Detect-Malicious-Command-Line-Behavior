       The misc_conv function is part of libpam_misc and not of the standard
       libpam library. This function will prompt the user with the
       appropriate comments and obtain the appropriate inputs as directed by
       authentication modules.
       In addition to simply slotting into the appropriate pam_conv(3), this
       function provides some time-out facilities. The function exports five
       variables that can be used by an application programmer to limit the
       amount of time this conversation function will spend waiting for the
       user to type something. The five variabls are as follows:
       time_t pam_misc_conv_warn_time;
           This variable contains the time (as returned by time(2)) that the
           user should be first warned that the clock is ticking. By default
           it has the value 0, which indicates that no such warning will be
           given. The application may set its value to sometime in the
           future, but this should be done prior to passing control to the
           Linux-PAM library.
       const char *pam_misc_conv_warn_line;
           Used in conjuction with pam_misc_conv_warn_time, this variable is
           a pointer to the string that will be displayed when it becomes
           time to warn the user that the timeout is approaching. Its
           default value is a translated version of “...Time is running
           out...”, but this can be changed by the application prior to
           passing control to Linux-PAM.
       time_t pam_misc_conv_die_time;
           This variable contains the time (as returned by time(2)) that the
           will time out. By default it has the value 0, which indicates
           that the conversation function will not timeout. The application
           may set its value to sometime in the future, but this should be
           done prior to passing control to the Linux-PAM library.
       const char *pam_misc_conv_die_line;
           Used in conjuction with pam_misc_conv_die_time, this variable is
           a pointer to the string that will be displayed when the
           conversation times out. Its default value is a translated version
           of “...Sorry, your time is up!”, but this can be changed by the
           application prior to passing control to Linux-PAM.
       int pam_misc_conv_died;
           Following a return from the Linux-PAM libraray, the value of this
           variable indicates whether the conversation has timed out. A
           value of 1 indicates the time-out occurred.
       The following two function pointers are available for supporting
       binary prompts in the conversation function. They are optimized for
       the current incarnation of the libpamc library and are subject to
       change.
       int (*pam_binary_handler_fn)(void *appdata, pamc_bp_t *prompt_p);
           This function pointer is initialized to NULL but can be filled
           with a function that provides machine-machine (hidden) message
           exchange. It is intended for use with hidden authentication
           protocols such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. (This is
           still under development.)
       int (*pam_binary_handler_free)(void *appdata, pamc_bp_t *delete_me);
           This function pointer is initialized to PAM_BP_RENEW(delete_me,
           0, 0), but can be redefined as desired by the application.
