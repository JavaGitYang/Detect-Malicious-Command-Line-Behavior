       slapacl is used to check the behavior of slapd(8) by verifying access
       to directory data according to the access control list directives
       defined in its configuration.  It opens the slapd.conf(5)
       configuration file or the slapd-config(5) backend, reads in the
       access/olcAccess directives, and then parses the attr list given on
       the command-line; if none is given, access to the entry pseudo-
       attribute is tested.
