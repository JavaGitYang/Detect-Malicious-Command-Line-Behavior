       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).
       The lgamma(), lgammaf(), and lgammal() functions return the natural
       logarithm of the absolute value of the Gamma function.  The sign of
       the Gamma function is returned in the external integer signgam
       declared in <math.h>.  It is 1 when the Gamma function is positive or
       zero, -1 when it is negative.
       Since using a constant location signgam is not thread-safe, the
       functions lgamma_r(), lgammaf_r(), and lgammal_r() have been
       introduced; they return the sign via the argument signp.
