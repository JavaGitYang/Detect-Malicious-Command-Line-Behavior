       This function will return the group parameters used in the last
       Diffie-Hellman key exchange with the peer.  These are the prime and
       the generator used.  This function should be used for both anonymous
       and ephemeral Diffie-Hellman.  The output parameters must be freed
       with gnutls_free().
       Note, that the prime and generator are exported as non-negative
       integers and may include a leading zero byte.
