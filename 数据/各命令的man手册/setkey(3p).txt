       The setkey() function provides access to an implementation-defined
       encoding algorithm. The argument of setkey() is an array of length 64
       bytes containing only the bytes with numerical value of 0 and 1. If
       this string is divided into groups of 8, the low-order bit in each
       group is ignored; this gives a 56-bit key which is used by the
       algorithm. This is the key that shall be used with the algorithm to
       encode a string block passed to encrypt().
       The setkey() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful. An application wishing to check for error situations
       should set errno to 0 before calling setkey().  If errno is non-zero
       on return, an error has occurred.
       The setkey() function need not be thread-safe.
