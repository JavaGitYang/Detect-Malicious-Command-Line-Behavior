       ausearch_add_timestamp_item adds an event time condition to the
       current audit search expression. The search conditions can then be
       used to scan logs, files, or buffers for something of interest. The
       op parameter specifies the desired comparison. Legal op values are <,
       <=, >=, > and =.  The left operand of the comparison operator is the
       timestamp of the examined event, the right operand is specified by
       the sec and milli parameters.
       The how value determines how this search condition will affect the
       existing search expression if one is already defined. The possible
       values are:
              AUSEARCH_RULE_CLEAR
                     Clear the current search expression, if any, and use
                     only this search condition.
              AUSEARCH_RULE_OR
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E || this_search_condition).
              AUSEARCH_RULE_AND
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E && this_search_condition).
