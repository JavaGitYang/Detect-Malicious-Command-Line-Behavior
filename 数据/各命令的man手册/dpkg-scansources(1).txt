       dpkg-scansources scans the given binary-dir for .dsc files.  These
       are used to create a Debian source index, which is output to stdout.
       The override-file, if given, is used to set priorities in the
       resulting index records and to override the maintainer field given in
       the .dsc files.  The file can be compressed (since dpkg 1.15.5).  See
       deb-override(5) for the format of this file. Note: Since the override
       file is indexed by binary, not source packages, there's a bit of a
       problem here. The current implementation uses the highest priority of
       all the binary packages produced by a .dsc file for the priority of
       the source package, and the override entry for the first binary
       package listed in the .dsc file to modify maintainer information.
       This might change.
       The path-prefix, if given, is prepended to the directory field in the
       generated source index. You generally use this to make the directory
       fields contain the path from the top of the Debian archive hierarchy.
       Note: If you want to access the generated Sources file with apt(8)
       you will probably need to compress the file with gzip(1) (generating
       a Sources.gz file). apt ignores uncompressed Sources files except on
       local access (i.e.  file:// sources).
