       This family of functions is deprecated.  For new code, please use
       selabel_open(3) with the SELABEL_CTX_FILE backend in place of
       matchpathcon_init(), use selabel_close(3) in place of
       matchpathcon_fini(), and use selabel_lookup(3) in place of
       matchpathcon().
       The remaining description below is for the legacy interface.
       matchpathcon_init() loads the file contexts configuration specified
       by path into memory for use by subsequent matchpathcon() calls.  If
       path is NULL, then the active file contexts configuration is loaded
       by default, i.e. the path returned by selinux_file_context_path(3).
       Unless the MATCHPATHCON_BASEONLY flag has been set via
       set_matchpathcon_flags(3), files with the same path prefix but a
       .homedirs and .local suffix are also looked up and loaded if present.
       These files provide dynamically generated entries for user home
       directories and for local customizations.
       matchpathcon_init_prefix() is the same as matchpathcon_init() but
       only loads entries with regular expressions whose first pathname
       component is a prefix of prefix , e.g. pass "/dev" if you only intend
       to call matchpathcon() with pathnames beginning with /dev.  However,
       this optimization is no longer necessary due to the use of
       file_contexts.bin files with precompiled regular expressions, so use
       of this interface is deprecated.
       matchpathcon_fini() frees the memory allocated by a prior call to
       matchpathcon_init.() This function can be used to free and reset the
       internal state between multiple matchpathcon_init() calls, or to free
       memory when finished using matchpathcon().
       matchpathcon() matches the specified pathname, after transformation
       via realpath(3) excepting any final symbolic link component if
       S_IFLNK was specified as the mode, and mode against the file contexts
       configuration and sets the security context con to refer to the
       resulting context. The caller must free the returned security context
       con using freecon(3) when finished using it.  mode can be 0 to
       disable mode matching, but should be provided whenever possible, as
       it may affect the matching.  Only the file format bits (i.e. the file
       type) of the mode are used.  If matchpathcon_init() has not already
       been called, then this function will call it upon its first
       invocation with a NULL path, defaulting to the active file contexts
       configuration.
       matchpathcon_index() is the same as matchpathcon() but returns a
       specification index that can later be used in a
       matchpathcon_filespec_add(3) call.
