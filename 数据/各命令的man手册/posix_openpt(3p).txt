       The posix_openpt() function shall establish a connection between a
       master device for a pseudo-terminal and a file descriptor. The file
       descriptor is used by other I/O functions that refer to that pseudo-
       terminal.
       The file status flags and file access modes of the open file
       description shall be set according to the value of oflag.
       Values for oflag are constructed by a bitwise-inclusive OR of flags
       from the following list, defined in <fcntl.h>:
       O_RDWR      Open for reading and writing.
       O_NOCTTY    If set posix_openpt() shall not cause the terminal device
                   to become the controlling terminal for the process.
       The behavior of other values for the oflag argument is unspecified.
