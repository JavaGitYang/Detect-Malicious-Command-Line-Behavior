       lxc-create creates a system object where is stored the configuration
       information and where can be stored user information. The identifier
       name is used to specify the container to be used with the different
       lxc commands.
       The object is a directory created in /usr/local/var/lib/lxc and
       identified by its name.
       The object is the definition of the different resources an
       application can use or can see. The more the configuration file
       contains information, the more the container is isolated and the more
       the application is jailed.
       If the configuration file config_file is not specified, the container
       will be created with the default isolation: processes, sysv ipc and
       mount points.
