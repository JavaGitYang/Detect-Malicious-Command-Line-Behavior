       systemd-remount-fs.service is an early boot service that applies
       mount options listed in fstab(5) to the root file system, the /usr
       file system, and the kernel API file systems. This is required so
       that the mount options of these file systems — which are pre-mounted
       by the kernel, the initial RAM disk, container environments or system
       manager code — are updated to those listed in /etc/fstab. This
       service ignores normal file systems and only changes the root file
       system (i.e.  /), /usr and the virtual kernel API file systems such
       as /proc, /sys or /dev. This service executes no operation if
       /etc/fstab does not exist or lists no entries for the mentioned file
       systems.
       For a longer discussion of kernel API file systems see API File
       Systems[1].
