       Git will sometimes need credentials from the user in order to perform
       operations; for example, it may need to ask for a username and
       password in order to access a remote repository over HTTP. This
       manual describes the mechanisms Git uses to request these
       credentials, as well as some features to avoid inputting these
       credentials repeatedly.
