       gethostid() and sethostid() respectively get or set a unique 32-bit
       identifier for the current machine.  The 32-bit identifier is
       intended to be unique among all UNIX systems in existence.  This
       normally resembles the Internet address for the local machine, as
       returned by gethostbyname(3), and thus usually never needs to be set.
       The sethostid() call is restricted to the superuser.
