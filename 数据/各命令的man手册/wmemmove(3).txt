       The wmemmove() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       memmove(3) function.  It copies n wide characters from the array
       starting at src to the array starting at dest.  The arrays may
       overlap.
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide
       characters at dest.
