       These programs are a set of helper scripts you can use instead of raw
       iproute2 commands.
       The routel script will list routes in a format that some might
       consider easier to interpret then the ip route list equivalent.
       The routef script does not take any arguments and will simply flush
       the routing table down the drain. Beware! This means deleting all
       routes which will make your network unusable!
