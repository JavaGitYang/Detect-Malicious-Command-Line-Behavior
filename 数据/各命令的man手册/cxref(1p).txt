       The cxref utility shall analyze a collection of C-language files and
       attempt to build a cross-reference table. Information from #define
       lines shall be included in the symbol table. A sorted listing shall
       be written to standard output of all symbols (auto, static, and
       global) in each file separately, or with the âˆ’c option, in
       combination. Each symbol shall contain an <asterisk> before the
       declaring reference.
