       This manual page documents the resource file of the pcp-atop and pcp-
       atopsar commands.  These commands can be used to monitor the system
       and process load on a system.
       The pcp-atoprc file contains the default settings. These settings are
       read during startup, first from the system-wide rcfile /etc/atoprc
       and after that from the user-specific rcfile ~/.atoprc (so system-
       wide settings can be overruled by an individual user).  The options
       in both rcfiles are identical.
