       The ualarm() function causes the signal SIGALRM to be sent to the
       invoking process after (not less than) usecs microseconds.  The delay
       may be lengthened slightly by any system activity or by the time
       spent processing the call or by the granularity of system timers.
       Unless caught or ignored, the SIGALRM signal will terminate the
       process.
       If the interval argument is nonzero, further SIGALRM signals will be
       sent every interval microseconds after the first.
