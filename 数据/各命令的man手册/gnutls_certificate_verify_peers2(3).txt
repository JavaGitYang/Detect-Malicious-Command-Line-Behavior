       This function will verify the peer's certificate and store the status
       in the  status variable as a bitwise OR of
       gnutls_certificate_status_t values or zero if the certificate is
       trusted. Note that value in  status is set only when the return value
       of this function is success (i.e, failure to trust a certificate does
       not imply a negative return value).  The default verification flags
       used by this function can be overridden using
       gnutls_certificate_set_verify_flags().
       This function will take into account the OCSP Certificate Status TLS
       extension, as well as the following X.509 certificate extensions:
       Name Constraints, Key Usage, and Basic Constraints (pathlen).
       To avoid denial of service attacks some default upper limits
       regarding the certificate key size and chain size are set. To
       override them use gnutls_certificate_set_verify_limits().
       Note that you must also check the peer's name in order to check if
       the verified certificate belongs to the actual peer, see
       gnutls_x509_crt_check_hostname(), or use
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers3().
