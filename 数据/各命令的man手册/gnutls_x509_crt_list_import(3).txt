       This function will convert the given PEM encoded certificate list to
       the native gnutls_x509_crt_t format. The output will be stored in
       certs .  They will be automatically initialized.
       The flag GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_IMPORT_FAIL_IF_EXCEED will cause import
       to fail if the certificates in the provided buffer are more than the
       available structures. The GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_FAIL_IF_UNSORTED flag
       will cause the function to fail if the provided list is not sorted
       from subject to issuer.
       If the Certificate is PEM encoded it should have a header of "X509
       CERTIFICATE", or "CERTIFICATE".
