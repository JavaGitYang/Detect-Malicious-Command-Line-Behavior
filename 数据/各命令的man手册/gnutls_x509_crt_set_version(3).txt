       This function will set the version of the certificate.  This must be
       one for X.509 version 1, and so on.  Plain certificates without
       extensions must have version set to one.
       To create well-formed certificates, you must specify version 3 if you
       use any certificate extensions.  Extensions are created by functions
       such as gnutls_x509_crt_set_subject_alt_name() or
       gnutls_x509_crt_set_key_usage().
