       The sprof command displays a profiling summary for the shared object
       (shared library) specified as its first command-line argument.  The
       profiling summary is created using previously generated profiling
       data in the (optional) second command-line argument.  If the
       profiling data pathname is omitted, then sprof will attempt to deduce
       it using the soname of the shared object, looking for a file with the
       name <soname>.profile in the current directory.
