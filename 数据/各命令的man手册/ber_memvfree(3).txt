       These routines are used to allocate/deallocate memory used/returned
       by the Lightweight BER library as required by lber-encode(3) and
       lber-decode(3).  ber_memalloc(), ber_memcalloc(), ber_memrealloc(),
       and ber_memfree() are used exactly like the standard malloc(3),
       calloc(3), realloc(3), and free(3) routines, respectively.  The
       ber_memvfree() routine is used to free a dynamically allocated array
       of pointers to arbitrary dynamically allocated objects.
