       sd_event_get_fd() returns the file descriptor that an event loop
       object returned by the sd_event_new(3) function uses to wait for
       events. This file descriptor may itself be polled for POLLIN/EPOLLIN
       events. This makes it possible to embed an sd-event(3) event loop
       into another, possibly foreign, event loop.
       The returned file descriptor refers to an epoll(7) object. It is
       recommended not to alter it by invoking epoll_ctl(2) on it, in order
       to avoid interference with the event loop's inner logic and
       assumptions.
