       The seekdir() function shall set the position of the next readdir()
       operation on the directory stream specified by dirp to the position
       specified by loc.  The value of loc should have been returned from an
       earlier call to telldir() using the same directory stream. The new
       position reverts to the one associated with the directory stream when
       telldir() was performed.
       If the value of loc was not obtained from an earlier call to
       telldir(), or if a call to rewinddir() occurred between the call to
       telldir() and the call to seekdir(), the results of subsequent calls
       to readdir() are unspecified.
