       pmdanvidia is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       extracts performance metrics describing the metrics available on
       NVIDIA GPU cards via the NVML library.
       The nvidia PMDA exports metrics that measure gpu activity, memory
       utilization, fan speed, etc on NVIDIA Tesla and Quadro cards.
       Metrics are unlikely to be available for consumer class cards.
       A brief description of the pmdanvidia command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            nvidia.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdanvidia is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
            standard error instead.
