       If the environment variable LDAPNOINIT is defined, all defaulting is
       disabled.
       The ldap.conf configuration file is used to set system-wide defaults
       to be applied when running ldap clients.
       Users may create an optional configuration file, ldaprc or .ldaprc,
       in their home directory which will be used to override the system-
       wide defaults file.  The file ldaprc in the current working directory
       is also used.
       Additional configuration files can be specified using the LDAPCONF
       and LDAPRC environment variables.  LDAPCONF may be set to the path of
       a configuration file.  This path can be absolute or relative to the
       current working directory.  The LDAPRC, if defined, should be the
       basename of a file in the current working directory or in the user's
       home directory.
       Environmental variables may also be used to augment the file based
       defaults.  The name of the variable is the option name with an added
       prefix of LDAP.  For example, to define BASE via the environment, set
       the variable LDAPBASE to the desired value.
       Some options are user-only.  Such options are ignored if present in
       the ldap.conf (or file specified by LDAPCONF).
       Thus the following files and variables are read, in order:
           variable     $LDAPNOINIT, and if that is not set:
           system file  ETCDIR/ldap.conf,
           user files   $HOME/ldaprc,  $HOME/.ldaprc,  ./ldaprc,
           system file  $LDAPCONF,
           user files   $HOME/$LDAPRC, $HOME/.$LDAPRC, ./$LDAPRC,
           variables    $LDAP<uppercase option name>.
       Settings late in the list override earlier ones.
