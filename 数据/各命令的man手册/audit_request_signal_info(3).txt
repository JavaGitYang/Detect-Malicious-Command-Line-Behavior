       audit_request_signal_info requests that the kernel send information
       about the sender of a signal to the audit daemon. The sinal info
       structure is as follows:
       struct audit_sig_info {
               uid_t           uid;
               pid_t           pid;
               char            ctx[0];
       };
       This function is likely to be used only by audit daemons and
       shouldn't be called by any other kind of program.
