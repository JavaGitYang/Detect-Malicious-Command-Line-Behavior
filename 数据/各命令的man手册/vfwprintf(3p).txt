       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The vfwprintf(), vswprintf(), and vwprintf() functions shall be
       equivalent to fwprintf(), swprintf(), and wprintf() respectively,
       except that instead of being called with a variable number of
       arguments, they are called with an argument list as defined by
       <stdarg.h>.
       These functions shall not invoke the va_end macro. However, as these
       functions do invoke the va_arg macro, the value of ap after the
       return is unspecified.
