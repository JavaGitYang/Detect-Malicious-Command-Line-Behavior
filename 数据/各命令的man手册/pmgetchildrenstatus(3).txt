       Given a fully qualified pathname to a node in the current Performance
       Metrics Name Space (PMNS), as identified by name, pmGetChildrenStatus
       returns via offspring a list of the relative names of all of the
       immediate descendent nodes of name in the current PMNS.
       As a special case, if name is an empty string (i.e.""), the immediate
       descendants of the root node in the PMNS will be returned.
       If status is not NULL, then pmGetChildrenStatus will also return the
       status of each child via status.  The status will refer to either a
       leaf node (with value PMNS_LEAF_STATUS ) or a non-leaf node (with
       value PMNS_NONLEAF_STATUS ).
       Normally, pmGetChildrenStatus will return the number of descendent
       names discovered, else a value less than zero for an error.  The
       value zero indicates that name is a valid metric name, i.e. is
       associated with a leaf node in the PMNS.
       The resulting list of pointers offspring and the values (the relative
       names) that the pointers reference will have been allocated by
       pmGetChildrenStatus with a single call to malloc(3), and it is the
       responsibility of the pmGetChildrenStatus caller to free(offspring)
       to release the space when it is no longer required.  The same holds
       true for the status array.
       When an error occurs, or name is a leaf node (i.e. the result of
       pmGetChildrenStatus is less than one), both offspring and status are
       undefined (no space will have been allocated, and so calling free(3)
       is a singularly bad idea).
