       lxc-autostart processes containers with lxc.start.auto set. It lets
       the user start, shutdown, kill, restart containers in the right
       order, waiting the right time. Supports filtering by lxc.group or
       just run against all defined containers. It can also be used by
       external tools in list mode where no action will be performed and the
       list of affected containers (and if relevant, delays) will be shown.
       The [-r], [-s] and [-k] options specify the action to perform.  If
       none is specified, then the containers will be started.  [-a] and
       [-g] are used to specify which containers will be affected. By
       default only containers without a lxc.group set will be affected.
       [-t TIMEOUT] specifies the maximum amount of time to wait for the
       container to complete the shutdown or reboot.
