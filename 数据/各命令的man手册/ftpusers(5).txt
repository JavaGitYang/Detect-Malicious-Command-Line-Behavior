       The text file ftpusers contains a list of users that may not log in
       using the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) server daemon.  This file is
       used not merely for system administration purposes but also for
       improving security within a TCP/IP networked environment.
       The ftpusers file will typically contain a list of the users that
       either have no business using ftp or have too many privileges to be
       allowed to log in through the FTP server daemon.  Such users usually
       include root, daemon, bin, uucp, and news.
       If your FTP server daemon doesn't use ftpusers, then it is suggested
       that you read its documentation to find out how to block access for
       certain users.  Washington University FTP server Daemon (wuftpd) and
       Professional FTP Daemon (proftpd) are known to make use of ftpusers.
   Format
       The format of ftpusers is very simple.  There is one account name (or
       username) per line.  Lines starting with a # are ignored.
