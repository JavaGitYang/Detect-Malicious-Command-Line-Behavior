     The acl_valid() function checks the ACL referred to by the argument acl
     for validity.
     The three required entries ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, and ACL_OTHER
     must exist exactly once in the ACL. If the ACL contains any ACL_USER or
     ACL_GROUP entries, then an ACL_MASK entry is also required. The ACL may
     contain at most one ACL_MASK entry.
     The user identifiers must be unique among all entries of type ACL_USER.
     The group identifiers must be unique among all entries of type
     ACL_GROUP.
