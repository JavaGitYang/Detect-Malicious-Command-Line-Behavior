       This function is used to parse the results returned in a search
       operation that uses a server-side sort control.
       It takes a null terminated array of LDAPControl structures usually
       obtained by a call to the ldap_parse_result function. A returncode
       which points to the sort control result code,and an array of
       LDAPControl structures that list the client controls to use with the
       search.  The function also takes an out parameter attribute and if
       the sort operation fails, the server may return a string that
       indicates the first attribute in the sortKey list that caused the
       failure. If this parameter is NULL, no string is returned. If a
       string is returned, the memory should be freed by calling the
       ldap_memfree function.
