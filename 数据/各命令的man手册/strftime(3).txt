       The strftime() function formats the broken-down time tm according to
       the format specification format and places the result in the
       character array s of size max.  The broken-down time structure tm is
       defined in <time.h>.  See also ctime(3).
       The format specification is a null-terminated string and may contain
       special character sequences called conversion specifications, each of
       which is introduced by a '%' character and terminated by some other
       character known as a conversion specifier character.  All other
       character sequences are ordinary character sequences.
       The characters of ordinary character sequences (including the null
       byte) are copied verbatim from format to s.  However, the characters
       of conversion specifications are replaced as shown in the list below.
       In this list, the field(s) employed from the tm structure are also
       shown.
       %a     The abbreviated name of the day of the week according to the
              current locale.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)
       %A     The full name of the day of the week according to the current
              locale.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)
       %b     The abbreviated month name according to the current locale.
              (Calculated from tm_mon.)
       %B     The full month name according to the current locale.
              (Calculated from tm_mon.)
       %c     The preferred date and time representation for the current
              locale.
       %C     The century number (year/100) as a 2-digit integer. (SU)
              (Calculated from tm_year.)
       %d     The day of the month as a decimal number (range 01 to 31).
              (Calculated from tm_mday.)
       %D     Equivalent to %m/%d/%y.  (Yecch—for Americans only.  Americans
              should note that in other countries %d/%m/%y is rather common.
              This means that in international context this format is
              ambiguous and should not be used.) (SU)
       %e     Like %d, the day of the month as a decimal number, but a
              leading zero is replaced by a space. (SU) (Calculated from
              tm_mday.)
       %E     Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)
       %F     Equivalent to %Y-%m-%d (the ISO 8601 date format). (C99)
       %G     The ISO 8601 week-based year (see NOTES) with century as a
              decimal number.  The 4-digit year corresponding to the ISO
              week number (see %V).  This has the same format and value as
              %Y, except that if the ISO week number belongs to the previous
              or next year, that year is used instead. (TZ) (Calculated from
              tm_year, tm_yday, and tm_wday.)
       %g     Like %G, but without century, that is, with a 2-digit year
              (00–99). (TZ) (Calculated from tm_year, tm_yday, and tm_wday.)
       %h     Equivalent to %b.  (SU)
       %H     The hour as a decimal number using a 24-hour clock (range 00
              to 23).  (Calculated from tm_hour.)
       %I     The hour as a decimal number using a 12-hour clock (range 01
              to 12).  (Calculated from tm_hour.)
       %j     The day of the year as a decimal number (range 001 to 366).
              (Calculated from tm_yday.)
       %k     The hour (24-hour clock) as a decimal number (range 0 to 23);

              (Calculated from tm_hour.)  (TZ)
       %m     The month as a decimal number (range 01 to 12).  (Calculated
              from tm_mon.)
       %M     The minute as a decimal number (range 00 to 59).  (Calculated
              from tm_min.)
       %n     A newline character. (SU)
       %O     Modifier: use alternative format, see below. (SU)
       %p     Either "AM" or "PM" according to the given time value, or the
              corresponding strings for the current locale.  Noon is treated
              as "PM" and midnight as "AM".  (Calculated from tm_hour.)
       %P     Like %p but in lowercase: "am" or "pm" or a corresponding
              string for the current locale.  (Calculated from tm_hour.)
              (GNU)
       %r     The time in a.m. or p.m. notation.  In the POSIX locale this
              is equivalent to %I:%M:%S %p.  (SU)

              +0000 (UTC). (TZ) (Calculated from mktime(tm).)
       %S     The second as a decimal number (range 00 to 60).  (The range
              is up to 60 to allow for occasional leap seconds.)
              (Calculated from tm_sec.)
       %t     A tab character. (SU)
       %T     The time in 24-hour notation (%H:%M:%S).  (SU)

              tm_wday.)
       %V     The ISO 8601 week number (see NOTES) of the current year as a
              decimal number, range 01 to 53, where week 1 is the first week
              that has at least 4 days in the new year.  See also %U and %W.

              0.  See also %u.  (Calculated from tm_wday.)
       %W     The week number of the current year as a decimal number, range
              00 to 53, starting with the first Monday as the first day of
              week 01.  (Calculated from tm_yday and tm_wday.)
       %x     The preferred date representation for the current locale
              without the time.
       %X     The preferred time representation for the current locale
              without the date.
       %y     The year as a decimal number without a century (range 00 to

              (Calculated from tm_year)
       %z     The +hhmm or -hhmm numeric timezone (that is, the hour and
              minute offset from UTC). (SU)
       %Z     The timezone name or abbreviation.
       %+     The date and time in date(1) format. (TZ) (Not supported in
              glibc2.)
       %%     A literal '%' character.
       Some conversion specifications can be modified by preceding the
       conversion specifier character by the E or O modifier to indicate
       that an alternative format should be used.  If the alternative format
       or specification does not exist for the current locale, the behavior
       will be as if the unmodified conversion specification were used. (SU)
       The Single UNIX Specification mentions %Ec, %EC, %Ex, %EX, %Ey, %EY,
       %Od, %Oe, %OH, %OI, %Om, %OM, %OS, %Ou, %OU, %OV, %Ow, %OW, %Oy,
       where the effect of the O modifier is to use alternative numeric
       symbols (say, roman numerals), and that of the E modifier is to use a
       locale-dependent alternative representation.
