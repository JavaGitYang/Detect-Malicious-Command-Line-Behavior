       pmdatrivial is the simplest possible Performance Metrics Domain Agent
       (PMDA) which exports a single performance metric, the time in seconds
       since the 1st of January, 1970.
       The trivial PMDA is shipped as source code and is designed to be an
       aid for PMDA developers.
       A brief description of the pmdatrivial command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            trivial.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdatrivial is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
            file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to
            the standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
