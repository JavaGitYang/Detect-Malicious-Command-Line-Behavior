       Lists the contents of a given tree object, like what "/bin/ls -a"
       does in the current working directory. Note that:
       ·   the behaviour is slightly different from that of "/bin/ls" in
           that the <path> denotes just a list of patterns to match, e.g. so
           specifying directory name (without -r) will behave differently,
           and order of the arguments does not matter.
       ·   the behaviour is similar to that of "/bin/ls" in that the <path>
           is taken as relative to the current working directory. E.g. when
           you are in a directory sub that has a directory dir, you can run
           git ls-tree -r HEAD dir to list the contents of the tree (that is
           sub/dir in HEAD). You don’t want to give a tree that is not at
           the root level (e.g.  git ls-tree -r HEAD:sub dir) in this case,
           as that would result in asking for sub/sub/dir in the HEAD
           commit. However, the current working directory can be ignored by
           passing --full-tree option.
