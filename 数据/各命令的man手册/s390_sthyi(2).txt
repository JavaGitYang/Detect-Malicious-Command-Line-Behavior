       The s390_sthyi() system call emulates the STHYI (Store Hypervisor
       Information) instruction.  It provides hardware resource information
       for the machine and its virtualization levels.  This includes CPU
       type and capacity, as well as the machine model and other metrics.
       The function_code argument indicates which function to perform.  The
       following code(s) are supported:
       0      Return CP (Central Processor) and IFL (Integrated Facility for
              Linux) capacity information.
       The resp_buffer argument specifies the address of a response buffer.
       If the system call returns 0, the response buffer will be filled with
       CPU capacity information.  Otherwise, the response buffer's content
       is unchanged.
       The return_code argument stores the return code of the STHYI
       instruction, using one of the following values:
       0       Success.
       4       Unsupported function code.
       For further details about return_code, function_code, and
       resp_buffer, see the reference given in NOTES.
       The flags argument is provided to allow for future extensions and
       currently must be set to 0.
