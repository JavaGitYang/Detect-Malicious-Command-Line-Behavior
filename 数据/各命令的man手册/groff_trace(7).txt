       The trace macro package of groff(1) can be a valuable tool for
       debugging documents written in the roff formatting language.  A call
       stack trace is protocolled on standard error, this is, a diagnostic
       message is emitted on entering and exiting of a macro call.  This
       greatly eases to track down an error in some macro.
       This tracing process is activated by specifying the groff or troff
       command-line option -m trace.  This works also with the groffer(1)
       viewer program.  A finer control can be obtained by including the
       macro file within the document by the groff macro call
       .mso trace.tmac.  Only macros that are defined after this line are
       traced.
       If the command-line option -r trace-full=1 is given (or if this
       register is set in the document), number and string register
       assignments together with some other requests are traced also.
       If some other macro package should be traced as well it must be
       specified after -m trace on the command line.
       The macro file trace.tmac is unusual because it does not contain any
       macros to be called by a user.  Instead, the existing macro
       definition and appending facilities are modified such that they
       display diagnostic messages.
