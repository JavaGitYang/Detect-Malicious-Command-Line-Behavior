       perfalloc is a command that notifies the pmdaperfevent(1) to disable
       hardware counter event collection.  This allow unprivileged processes
       to use the hardware counters.
       If the reservation request fails, then perfalloc exits immediately
       with exit code EXIT_FAILURE.  If successful, the perfalloc will run
       until a kill signal is received.  The reservation request persists
       while perfalloc is running.
       Note that pmdaperfevent is affected by the value of the
       kernel.perf_event_paranoid setting, which can be adjusted by
       sysctl(8).
       If a commandline is given, this is executed as a subprocess of the
       agent.  When the command dies, so does the agent.
       A brief description of the command line options follows:
       -D   run in the foreground (the default)
       -d   run in the background
       -f FILE
            use FILE as the lock file (default
            $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/perfevent/perflock)
       -h   display a help message and exit
       -v   output version number and exit
