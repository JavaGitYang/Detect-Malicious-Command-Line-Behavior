       capng_print_caps_numeric will create a numeric representation of the
       internal capabilities. The representation can be sent to either
       stdout or a buffer by passing CAPNG_PRINT_STDOUT or
       CAPNG_PRINT_BUFFER respectively for the where parameter. If the
       option was for a buffer, this function will malloc a buffer that the
       caller must free.
       The set parameter controls what is included in the representation.
       The legal options are CAPNG_SELECT_CAPS for the traditional
       capabilities, CAPNG_SELECT_BOUNDS for the bounding set, or
       CAPNG_SELECT_BOTH if clearing both is desired.
