       Run the executable within the specified context, using the alternate
       home directory and /tmp directory.  The seunshare command unshares
       from the default namespace, then mounts the specified homedir and
       tmpdir over the default homedir and /tmp. Finally it tells the kernel
       to execute the application under the specified SELinux context.
       -h homedir
              Alternate homedir to be used by the application.  Homedir must
              be owned by the user.
       -t tmpdir
              Use alternate tempory directory to mount on /tmp.  tmpdir must
              be owned by the user.
       -C --capabilities
              Allow apps executed within the namespace to use capabilities.
              Default is no capabilities.
       -k --kill
              Kill all processes with matching MCS level.
       -Z context
              Use alternate SELinux context while running the executable.
       -v     Verbose output
