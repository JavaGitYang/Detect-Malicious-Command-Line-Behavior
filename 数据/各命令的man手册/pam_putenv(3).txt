       The pam_putenv function is used to add or change the value of PAM
       environment variables as associated with the pamh handle.
       The pamh argument is an authentication handle obtained by a prior
       call to pam_start(). The name_value argument is a single NUL
       terminated string of one of the following forms:
       NAME=value of variable
           In this case the environment variable of the given NAME is set to
           the indicated value: value of variable. If this variable is
           already known, it is overwritten. Otherwise it is added to the
           PAM environment.
       NAME=
           This function sets the variable to an empty value. It is listed
           separately to indicate that this is the correct way to achieve
           such a setting.
       NAME
           Without an '=' the pam_putenv() function will delete the
           corresponding variable from the PAM environment.
       pam_putenv() operates on a copy of name_value, which means in
       contrast to putenv(3), the application is responsible to free the
       data.
