       The getservent() function reads the next entry from the services
       database (see services(5)) and returns a servent structure containing
       the broken-out fields from the entry.  A connection is opened to the
       database if necessary.
       The getservbyname() function returns a servent structure for the
       entry from the database that matches the service name using protocol
       proto.  If proto is NULL, any protocol will be matched.  A connection
       is opened to the database if necessary.
       The getservbyport() function returns a servent structure for the
       entry from the database that matches the port port (given in network
       byte order) using protocol proto.  If proto is NULL, any protocol
       will be matched.  A connection is opened to the database if
       necessary.
       The setservent() function opens a connection to the database, and
       sets the next entry to the first entry.  If stayopen is nonzero, then
       the connection to the database will not be closed between calls to
       one of the getserv*() functions.
       The endservent() function closes the connection to the database.
       The servent structure is defined in <netdb.h> as follows:
           struct servent {
               char  *s_name;       /* official service name */
               char **s_aliases;    /* alias list */
               int    s_port;       /* port number */
               char  *s_proto;      /* protocol to use */
           }
       The members of the servent structure are:
       s_name The official name of the service.
       s_aliases
              A NULL-terminated list of alternative names for the service.
       s_port The port number for the service given in network byte order.
       s_proto
              The name of the protocol to use with this service.
