       These functions shall retrieve information about hosts. This
       information is considered to be stored in a database that can be
       accessed sequentially or randomly. The implementation of this
       database is unspecified.
       Note:     In many cases this database is implemented by the Domain
                 Name System, as documented in RFC 1034, RFC 1035, and
                 RFC 1886.
       The sethostent() function shall open a connection to the database and
       set the next entry for retrieval to the first entry in the database.
       If the stayopen argument is non-zero, the connection shall not be
       closed by a call to gethostent(), and the implementation may maintain
       an open file descriptor.
       The gethostent() function shall read the next entry in the database,
       opening and closing a connection to the database as necessary.
       Entries shall be returned in hostent structures.
       The endhostent() function shall close the connection to the database,
       releasing any open file descriptor.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
