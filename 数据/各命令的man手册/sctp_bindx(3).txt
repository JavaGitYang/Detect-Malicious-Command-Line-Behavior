       sctp_bindx adds or removes a set of bind addresses passed in the
       array addrs to/from the socket sd.  addrcnt is the number of
       addresses in the array and the flags paramater indicates if the
       addresses need to be added or removed.
       If sd is an IPv4 socket, the addresses passed must be IPv4 addresses.
       If sd is an IPv6 socket, the addresses passed can be either IPv4 or
       IPv6 addresses.
       addrs is a pointer to an array of one or more socket addresses. Each
       address is contained in its appropriate structure(i.e. struct
       sockaddr_in or struct sockaddr_in6). The family of the address type
       must be used to distinguish the address length. The caller specifies
       the number of addresses in the array with addrcnt.
       The flags parameter can be either SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR or
       SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR.  An application can use SCTP_BINDX_ADD_ADDR to
       associate additional addresses with an endpoint after calling
       bind(2).  SCTP_BINDX_REM_ADDR directs SCTP to remove the given
       addresses from the association.  A caller may not remove all
       addresses from an association. It will fail with EINVAL.
