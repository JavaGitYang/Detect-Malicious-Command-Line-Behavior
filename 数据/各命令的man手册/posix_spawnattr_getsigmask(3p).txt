       The posix_spawnattr_getsigmask() function shall obtain the value of
       the spawn-sigmask attribute from the attributes object referenced by
       attr.
       The posix_spawnattr_setsigmask() function shall set the spawn-sigmask
       attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced by attr.
       The spawn-sigmask attribute represents the signal mask in effect in
       the new process image of a spawn operation (if POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
       is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this
       attribute is unspecified.
