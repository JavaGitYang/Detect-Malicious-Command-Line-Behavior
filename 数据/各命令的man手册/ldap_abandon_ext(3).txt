       The ldap_abandon_ext() routine is used to send a LDAP Abandon request
       for an operation in progress.  The msgid passed should be the message
       id of an outstanding LDAP operation, such as returned by
       ldap_search_ext(3).
       ldap_abandon_ext() checks to see if the result of the operation has
       already come in.  If it has, it deletes it from the queue of pending
       messages.  If not, it sends an LDAP abandon request to the LDAP
       server.
       The caller can expect that the result of an abandoned operation will
       not be returned from a future call to ldap_result(3).
       ldap_abandon_ext() allows server and client controls to be passed in
       via the sctrls and cctrls parameters, respectively.
       ldap_abandon_ext() returns a code indicating success or, in the case
       of failure, the nature of the failure.  See ldap_error(3) for
       details.
