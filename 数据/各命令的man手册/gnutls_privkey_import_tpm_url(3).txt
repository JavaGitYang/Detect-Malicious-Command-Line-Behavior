       This function will import the given private key to the abstract
       gnutls_privkey_t type.
       Note that unless GNUTLS_PRIVKEY_DISABLE_CALLBACKS is specified, if
       incorrect (or NULL) passwords are given the PKCS11 callback functions
       will be used to obtain the correct passwords. Otherwise if the SRK
       password is wrong GNUTLS_E_TPM_SRK_PASSWORD_ERROR is returned and if
       the key password is wrong or not provided then
       GNUTLS_E_TPM_KEY_PASSWORD_ERROR is returned.
