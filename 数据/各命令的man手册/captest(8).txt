       captest is a program that demonstrates and prints out the current
       process capabilities. Each option prints the same report. It will
       output current capabilities. then it will try to access /etc/shadow
       directly to show if that can be done. Then it creates a child process
       that attempts to read /etc/shadow and outputs the results of that.
       Then it outputs the capabilities that a child process would have.
       You can also apply file system capabilities to this program to study
       how they work. For example, filecap /usr/bin/captest chown. Then run
       captest as a normal user. Another interesting test is to make captest
       suid root so that you can see what the interaction is between root's
       credentials and capabilities. For example, chmod 4755
       /usr/bin/captest. When run as a normal user, the program will see if
       privilege escalation is possible. But do not leave this app setuid
       root after you are don testing so that an attacker cannot take
       advantage of it.
