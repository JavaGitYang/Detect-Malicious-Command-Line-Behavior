       The rpcsec_gss protocol gives a means of using the gss-api generic
       security api to provide security for protocols using rpc (in
       particular, nfs).  Before exchanging any rpc requests using
       rpcsec_gss, the rpc client must first establish a security context
       with the rpc server.  The linux kernel's implementation of rpcsec_gss
       depends on the userspace daemon rpc.svcgssd to handle context
       establishment on the rpc server.  The daemon uses files in the proc
       filesystem to communicate with the kernel.
