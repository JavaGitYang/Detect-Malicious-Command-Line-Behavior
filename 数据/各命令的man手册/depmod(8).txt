       Linux kernel modules can provide services (called "symbols") for
       other modules to use (using one of the EXPORT_SYMBOL variants in the
       code). If a second module uses this symbol, that second module
       clearly depends on the first module. These dependencies can get quite
       complex.
       depmod creates a list of module dependencies by reading each module
       under /lib/modules/version and determining what symbols it exports
       and what symbols it needs. By default, this list is written to
       modules.dep, and a binary hashed version named modules.dep.bin, in
       the same directory. If filenames are given on the command line, only
       those modules are examined (which is rarely useful unless all modules
       are listed).  depmod also creates a list of symbols provided by
       modules in the file named modules.symbols and its binary hashed
       version, modules.symbols.bin. Finally, depmod will output a file
       named modules.devname if modules supply special device names
       (devname) that should be populated in /dev on boot (by a utility such
       as systemd-tmpfiles).
       If a version is provided, then that kernel version's module directory
       is used rather than the current kernel version (as returned by uname
       -r).
