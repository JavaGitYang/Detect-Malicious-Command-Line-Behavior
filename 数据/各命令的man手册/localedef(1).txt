       The localedef program reads the indicated charmap and input files,
       compiles them to a binary form quickly usable by the locale functions
       in the C library (setlocale(3), localeconv(3), etc.), and places the
       output in outputpath.
       The outputpath argument is interpreted as follows:
       *  If outputpath contains a slash character ('/'), it is interpreted
          as the name of the directory where the output definitions are to
          be stored.  In this case, there is a separate output file for each
          locale category (LC_TIME, LC_NUMERIC, and so on).
       *  If the --no-archive option is used, outputpath is the name of a
          subdirectory in /usr/lib/locale where per-category compiled files
          are placed.
       *  Otherwise, outputpath is the name of a locale and the compiled
          locale data is added to the archive file /usr/lib/locale/locale-
          archive.  A locale archive is a memory-mapped file which contains
          all the system-provided locales; it is used by all localized
          programs when the environment variable LOCPATH is not set.
       In any case, localedef aborts if the directory in which it tries to
       write locale files has not already been created.
       If no charmapfile is given, the value ANSI_X3.4-1968 (for ASCII) is
       used by default.  If no inputfile is given, or if it is given as a
       dash (-), localedef reads from standard input.
