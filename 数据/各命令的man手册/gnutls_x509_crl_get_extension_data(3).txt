       This function will return the requested extension data in the CRL.
       The extension data will be stored as a string in the provided buffer.
       Use gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info() to extract the OID and
       critical flag.  Use gnutls_x509_crl_get_extension_info() instead, if
       you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather than
       sequence.
