       The command "list" output format is deprecated and maintained for
       backward compatibility only. The new output format is the default
       when no command is specified or when the option --output is used.
       The default output is subject to change.  So whenever possible, you
       should avoid using default outputs in your scripts.  Always
       explicitly define expected columns by using the --output option
       together with a columns list in environments where a stable output is
       required.
