       pfifo_fast is the default qdisc of each interface.
       Whenever an interface is created, the pfifo_fast qdisc is
       automatically used as a queue. If another qdisc is attached, it
       preempts the default pfifo_fast, which automatically returns to
       function when an existing qdisc is detached.
       In this sense this qdisc is magic, and unlike other qdiscs.
