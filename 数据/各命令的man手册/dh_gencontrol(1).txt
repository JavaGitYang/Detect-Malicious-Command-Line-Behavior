       dh_gencontrol is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       generating control files, and installing them into the DEBIAN
       directory with the proper permissions.
       This program is merely a wrapper around dpkg-gencontrol(1), which
       calls it once for each package being acted on (plus related dbgsym
       packages), and passes in some additional useful flags.
       Note that if you use dh_gencontrol, you must also use dh_builddeb(1)
       to build the packages.  Otherwise, your build may fail to build as
       dh_gencontrol (via dpkg-gencontrol(1)) declares which packages are
       built.  As debhelper automatically generates dbgsym packages, it some
       times adds additional packages, which will be built by
       dh_builddeb(1).
