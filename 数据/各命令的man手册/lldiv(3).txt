       The div() function computes the value numerator/denominator and
       returns the quotient and remainder in a structure named div_t that
       contains two integer members (in unspecified order) named quot and
       rem.  The quotient is rounded toward zero.  The result satisfies
       quot*denominator+rem = numerator.
       The ldiv(), lldiv(), and imaxdiv() functions do the same, dividing
       numbers of the indicated type and returning the result in a structure
       of the indicated name, in all cases with fields quot and rem of the
       same type as the function arguments.
