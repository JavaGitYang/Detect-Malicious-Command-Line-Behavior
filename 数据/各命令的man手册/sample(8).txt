       The sample action allows sampling packets matching classifier.
       The packets are chosen randomly according to the rate parameter, and
       are sampled using the psample generic netlink channel. The user can
       also specify packet truncation to save user-kernel traffic. Each
       sample includes some informative metadata about the original packet,
       which is sent using netlink attributes, alongside the original packet
       data.
       The user can either specify the sample action parameters as presented
       in the first form above, or use an existing sample action using its
       index, as presented in the second form.
