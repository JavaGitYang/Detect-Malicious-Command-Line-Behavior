       This convenience function will import the given certificate to a
       gnutls_pcert_st structure. The structure must be deinitialized
       afterwards using gnutls_pcert_deinit();
       In the case GNUTLS_X509_CRT_LIST_SORT is specified and that function
       cannot sort the list, GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_LIST_UNSORTED will be
       returned. Currently sorting can fail if the list size exceeds an
       internal constraint (16).
