       If job control is enabled (see the description of set âˆ’m), the fg
       utility shall move a background job from the current environment (see
       Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment) into the foreground.
       Using fg to place a job into the foreground shall remove its process

       environment''; see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples.
