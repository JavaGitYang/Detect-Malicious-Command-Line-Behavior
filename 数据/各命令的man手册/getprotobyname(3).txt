       The getprotoent() function reads the next entry from the protocols
       database (see protocols(5)) and returns a protoent structure
       containing the broken-out fields from the entry.  A connection is
       opened to the database if necessary.
       The getprotobyname() function returns a protoent structure for the
       entry from the database that matches the protocol name name.  A
       connection is opened to the database if necessary.
       The getprotobynumber() function returns a protoent structure for the
       entry from the database that matches the protocol number number.  A
       connection is opened to the database if necessary.
       The setprotoent() function opens a connection to the database, and
       sets the next entry to the first entry.  If stayopen is nonzero, then
       the connection to the database will not be closed between calls to
       one of the getproto*() functions.
       The endprotoent() function closes the connection to the database.
       The protoent structure is defined in <netdb.h> as follows:
           struct protoent {
               char  *p_name;       /* official protocol name */
               char **p_aliases;    /* alias list */
               int    p_proto;      /* protocol number */
           }
       The members of the protoent structure are:
       p_name The official name of the protocol.
       p_aliases
              A NULL-terminated list of alternative names for the protocol.
       p_proto
              The protocol number.
