       Determine the time cron will execute the next job.  Without
       arguments, it prints that time considering all crontabs, in number of
       seconds since the Epoch, rounded to the minute. This number can be
       converted into other formats using date(1), like date --date
       @43243254
       The file arguments are optional. If provided, cronnext uses them as
       crontabs instead of the ones installed in the system.
