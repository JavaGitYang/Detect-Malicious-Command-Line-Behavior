       These functions are deprecated: instead, use either the tgamma(3) or
       the lgamma(3) functions, as appropriate.
       For the definition of the Gamma function, see tgamma(3).
   *BSD version
       The libm in 4.4BSD and some versions of FreeBSD had a gamma()
       function that computes the Gamma function, as one would expect.
   glibc version
       Glibc has a gamma() function that is equivalent to lgamma(3) and
       computes the natural logarithm of the Gamma function.
