       systemd-delta may be used to identify and compare configuration files
       that override other configuration files. Files in /etc have highest
       priority, files in /run have the second highest priority, ..., files
       in /usr/lib have lowest priority. Files in a directory with higher
       priority override files with the same name in directories of lower
       priority. In addition, certain configuration files can have ".d"
       directories which contain "drop-in" files with configuration snippets
       which augment the main configuration file. "Drop-in" files can be
       overridden in the same way by placing files with the same name in a
       directory of higher priority (except that, in case of "drop-in"
       files, both the "drop-in" file name and the name of the containing
       directory, which corresponds to the name of the main configuration
       file, must match). For a fuller explanation, see systemd.unit(5).
       The command line argument will be split into a prefix and a suffix.
       Either is optional. The prefix must be one of the directories
       containing configuration files (/etc, /run, /usr/lib, ...). If it is
       given, only overriding files contained in this directory will be
       shown. Otherwise, all overriding files will be shown. The suffix must
       be a name of a subdirectory containing configuration files like
       tmpfiles.d, sysctl.d or systemd/system. If it is given, only
       configuration files in this subdirectory (across all configuration
       paths) will be analyzed. Otherwise, all configuration files will be
       analyzed. If the command line argument is not given at all, all
       configuration files will be analyzed. See below for some examples.
