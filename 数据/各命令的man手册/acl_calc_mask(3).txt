     The acl_calc_mask() function calculates and sets the permissions asso‐
     ciated with the ACL_MASK ACL entry of the ACL referred to by acl_p.
     The value of the new permissions is the union of the permissions
     granted by all entries of tag type ACL_GROUP, ACL_GROUP_OBJ, or
     ACL_USER.  If the ACL referred to by acl_p already contains an ACL_MASK
     entry, its permissions are overwritten; if it does not contain an
     ACL_MASK entry, one is added.
     If the ACL referred to by acl_p does not contain enough space for the
     new ACL entry, then additional working storage may be allocated. If the
     working storage cannot be increased in the current location, then it
     may be relocated and the previous working storage is released and a
     pointer to the new working storage is returned via acl_p.
     The order of existing entries in the ACL is undefined after this func‐
     tion.
     Any existing ACL entry descriptors that refer to entries in the ACL
     continue to refer to those entries. Any existing ACL pointers that
     refer to the ACL referred to by acl_p continue to refer to the ACL.
