       The truncate() and ftruncate() functions cause the regular file named
       by path or referenced by fd to be truncated to a size of precisely
       length bytes.
       If the file previously was larger than this size, the extra data is
       lost.  If the file previously was shorter, it is extended, and the
       extended part reads as null bytes ('\0').
       The file offset is not changed.
       If the size changed, then the st_ctime and st_mtime fields
       (respectively, time of last status change and time of last
       modification; see inode(7)) for the file are updated, and the set-
       user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits may be cleared.
       With ftruncate(), the file must be open for writing; with truncate(),
       the file must be writable.
