       chcpu can modify the state of CPUs.  It can enable or disable CPUs,
       scan for new CPUs, change the CPU dispatching mode of the underlying
       hypervisor, and request CPUs from the hypervisor (configure) or
       return CPUs to the hypervisor (deconfigure).
       Some options have a cpu-list argument.  Use this argument to specify
       a comma-separated list of CPUs.  The list can contain individual CPU
       addresses or ranges of addresses.  For example, 0,5,7,9-11 makes the
       command applicable to the CPUs with the addresses 0, 5, 7, 9, 10, and
       11.
