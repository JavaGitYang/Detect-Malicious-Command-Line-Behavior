       sd_get_seats() may be used to determine all currently available local
       seats. Returns the number of seat identifiers and if the input
       pointer is non-NULL, a NULL-terminated array of seat identifiers is
       stored at the address. The returned array and all strings it
       references need to be freed with the libc free(3) call after use.
       Note that instead of an empty array NULL may be returned and should
       be considered equivalent to an empty array.
       Similarly, sd_get_sessions() may be used to determine all current
       login sessions.
       Similarly, sd_get_uids() may be used to determine all Unix users who
       currently have login sessions.
       Similarly, sd_get_machine_names() may be used to determine all
       current virtual machines and containers on the system.
       Note that the returned lists are not sorted and in an undefined
       order.
