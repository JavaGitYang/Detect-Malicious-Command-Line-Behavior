       For strxfrm(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The strxfrm() and strxfrm_l() functions shall transform the string
       pointed to by s2 and place the resulting string into the array
       pointed to by s1.  The transformation is such that if strcmp() is
       applied to two transformed strings, it shall return a value greater
       than, equal to, or less than 0, corresponding to the result of
       strcoll() or strcoll_l(), respectively, applied to the same two
       original strings with the same locale.  No more than n bytes are
       placed into the resulting array pointed to by s1, including the
       terminating NUL character. If n is 0, s1 is permitted to be a null
       pointer. If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
       behavior is undefined.
       The strxfrm() and strxfrm_l() functions shall not change the setting
       of errno if successful.
       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call strxfrm() or strxfrm_l(), then check errno.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to strxfrm_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
