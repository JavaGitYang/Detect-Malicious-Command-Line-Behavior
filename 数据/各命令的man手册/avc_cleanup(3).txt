       avc_open() initializes the userspace AVC and must be called before
       any other AVC operation can be performed.
       avc_destroy() destroys the userspace AVC, freeing all internal memory
       structures.  After this call has been made, avc_open() must be called
       again before any AVC operations can be performed.
       avc_reset() flushes the userspace AVC, causing it to forget any
       cached access decisions.  The userspace AVC normally calls this
       function automatically when needed, see NETLINK NOTIFICATION below.
       avc_cleanup() attempts to free unused memory within the userspace
       AVC, but does not flush any cached access decisions.  Under normal
       operation, calling this function should not be necessary.
