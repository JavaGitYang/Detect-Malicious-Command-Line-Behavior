       flowtop is a top-like connection tracking tool that can run on an end
       host or small home router. It is able to present TCP, UDP/UDP-lite,
       SCTP, DCCP, and ICMP(v6) flows that have been collected by the
       kernel's netfilter connection tracking framework, thus no packet
       capturing in user space needs to be done.
       flowtop is able to give you a quick overview of current connections
       on your local system, e.g. for debugging purposes or to answer
       questions like:
           * If you access website X, what other connections are being
       opened in
             the background that I'm not aware of?
           * What connections are active that pass one's router?
           * I have this proprietary binary Y, to where does it connect?
           * To which countries am I sending data?
           * Are there any suspicious background connections on my machine?
           * How many active connections does binary Y have?
           * How long are connections active already?
           * At which rate am I sending/receiving data?
       The following information will be presented in flowtop's output:
           * Application name and PID when run on local machine
           * Reverse DNS for source and destination
           * Geo-location information (country, city)
           * Used protocols (IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, SCTP, ICMP, ...)
           * Flow port's service name heuristic
           * Transport protocol state machine information
           * Byte/packet counters (if they are enabled)
           * Connection duration (if timestamping is enabled)
           * Flow send/receive rate (if byte/packet counters are enabled)
       In order for flowtop to work, netfilter must be active and running on
       your machine, thus kernel-side connection tracking is active. If
       netfilter is not running, you can activate it with iptables(8):
           iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m state --state ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
           iptables -A OUTPUT -p tcp -m state --state NEW,ESTABLISHED -j
           ACCEPT
       or by loading the following kernel modules:
           modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv4
           modprobe nf_conntrack_ipv6
       To dump byte/packet counters flowtop enables the sysctl(8) parameter
       “net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_acct” via:
           echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_acct
       and resets it to the previously set value on exit. These counters
       will only be active on connections which were created after
       accounting was enabled. Thus, to have these counters be active all
       the time the parameter should be enabled after the system is up. To
       automatically enable it, sysctl.conf(8) or sysctl.d(8) might be used.
       To calculate the connection duration flowtop enables the sysctl(8)
       parameter “net.netfilter.nf_conntrack_timestamp” via:
           echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/netfilter/nf_conntrack_timestamp
       and resets it to the previously set value on exit.
       flowtop's intention is just to get a quick look over your active
       connections.  If you want logging support, have a look at netfilter's
       conntrack(8) tools instead.
