       nfs4_getfacl will display the NFSv4 Access Control List (ACL) for the
       files given as arguments, provided they are on mounted NFSv4
       filesystems which support ACLs.
       If the -H/--more-help flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will print some
       information about NFSv4 ACLs and the fields used in ACEs.
       If the -R/--recursive flag is specified, nfs4_getfacl will list the
       NFSv4 ACLs of all files and directories recursively.
       The output format for an NFSv4 file ACL, e.g., is:
              # file: /somedir
              A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy
              A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
              A::bob@nfsdomain.org:rwadtTnNcCy
              A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
              D:g:GROUP@:waxTC
              A::EVERYONE@:rtncy
              D::EVERYONE@:waxTC
       In the example output above, the user `alice@nfsdomain.org' has the
       equivalent of "read" and "execute" permissions, `bob@nfsdomain.org'
       has "read" and "write", and both `GROUP@' and `EVERYONE@' have
       "read".
       The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.
       Refer to the nfs4_acl(5) manpage for detailed information about NFSv4
       ACL terminology and syntax.
