       ausearch_add_item adds one search condition to the current audit
       search expression. The search conditions can then be used to scan
       logs, files, or buffers for something of interest. The field value is
       the field name that the value will be checked for. The op variable
       describes what kind of check is to be done. Legal op values are:
              exists
                      just check that a field name exists
              =
                      locate the field name and check that the value
                     associated with it is equal to the value given in this
                     rule.
              !=
                      locate the field name and check that the value
                     associated with it is NOT equal to the value given in
                     this rule.
       The value parameter is compared to the uninterpreted field value. If
       you are trying to match against a field who's type is
       AUPARSE_TYPE_ESCAPED, you will want to use the
       ausearch_add_interpreted_item() function instead.
       The how value determines how this search condition will affect the
       existing search expression if one is already defined. The possible
       values are:
              AUSEARCH_RULE_CLEAR
                     Clear the current search expression, if any, and use
                     only this search condition.
              AUSEARCH_RULE_OR
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E || this_search_condition).
              AUSEARCH_RULE_AND
                     If a search expression E is already configured, replace
                     it by (E && this_search_condition).
