       When generating private and public key pairs a difficult question is
       which size of "bits" the modulus will be in RSA and the group size in
       DSA. The easy answer is 1024, which is also wrong. This function will
       convert a human understandable security parameter to an appropriate
       size for the specific algorithm.
