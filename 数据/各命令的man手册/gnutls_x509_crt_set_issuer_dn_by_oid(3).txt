       This function will set the part of the name of the Certificate
       issuer, specified by the given OID.  The input string should be ASCII
       or UTF-8 encoded.
       Some helper macros with popular OIDs can be found in gnutls/x509.h
       With this function you can only set the known OIDs. You can test for
       known OIDs using gnutls_x509_dn_oid_known(). For OIDs that are not
       known (by gnutls) you should properly DER encode your data, and call
       this function with  raw_flag set.
       Normally you do not need to call this function, since the signing
       operation will copy the signer's name as the issuer of the
       certificate.
