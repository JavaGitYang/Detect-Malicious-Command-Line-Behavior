       The gitweb CGI script for viewing Git repositories over the web uses
       a perl script fragment as its configuration file. You can set
       variables using "our $variable = value"; text from a "#" character
       until the end of a line is ignored. See perlsyn(1) for details.
       An example:
           # gitweb configuration file for http://git.example.org
           #
           our $projectroot = "/srv/git"; # FHS recommendation
           our $site_name = 'Example.org >> Repos';
       The configuration file is used to override the default settings that
       were built into gitweb at the time the gitweb.cgi script was
       generated.
       While one could just alter the configuration settings in the gitweb
       CGI itself, those changes would be lost upon upgrade. Configuration
       settings might also be placed into a file in the same directory as
       the CGI script with the default name gitweb_config.perl â€” allowing
       one to have multiple gitweb instances with different configurations
       by the use of symlinks.
       Note that some configuration can be controlled on per-repository
       rather than gitweb-wide basis: see "Per-repository gitweb
       configuration" subsection on gitweb(1) manpage.
