       The lvalue errno is used by many functions to return error values.
       Many functions provide an error number in errno, which has type int
       and is defined in <errno.h>.  The value of errno shall be defined
       only after a call to a function for which it is explicitly stated to
       be set and until it is changed by the next function call or if the
       application assigns it a value. The value of errno should only be
       examined when it is indicated to be valid by a function's return
       value. Applications shall obtain the definition of errno by the
       inclusion of <errno.h>.  No function in this volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008
       shall set errno to 0. The setting of errno after a successful call to
       a function is unspecified unless the description of that function
       specifies that errno shall not be modified.
       It is unspecified whether errno is a macro or an identifier declared
       with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed in order
       to access an actual object, or a program defines an identifier with
       the name errno, the behavior is undefined.
       The symbolic values stored in errno are documented in the ERRORS
       sections on all relevant pages.
