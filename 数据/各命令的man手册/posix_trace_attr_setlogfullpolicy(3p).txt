       The posix_trace_attr_getinherited() and
       posix_trace_attr_setinherited() functions, respectively, shall get
       and set the inheritance policy stored in the inheritance attribute
       for traced processes across the fork() and spawn() operations. The
       inheritance attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr
       argument shall be set to one of the following values defined by
       manifest constants in the <trace.h> header:
       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD
             After a fork() or spawn() operation, the child shall not be
             traced, and tracing of the parent shall continue.
       POSIX_TRACE_INHERITED
             After a fork() or spawn() operation, if the parent is being
             traced, its child shall be concurrently traced using the same
             trace stream.
       The default value for the inheritance attribute is
       POSIX_TRACE_CLOSE_FOR_CHILD.
       The posix_trace_attr_getlogfullpolicy() and
       posix_trace_attr_setlogfullpolicy() functions, respectively, shall
       get and set the trace log full policy stored in the log-full-policy
       attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr argument.
       The log-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of the following
       values defined by manifest constants in the <trace.h> header:
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace log shall loop until the associated trace stream is
             stopped.  This policy means that when the trace log gets full,
             the file system shall reuse the resources allocated to the
             oldest trace events that were recorded. In this way, the trace
             log will always contain the most recent trace events flushed.
       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log until the
             trace log is full. This condition can be deduced from the
             posix_log_full_status member status (see the
             posix_trace_status_info structure defined in <trace.h>).  The
             last recorded trace event shall be the POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace
             event.
       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND
             The associated trace stream shall be flushed to the trace log
             without log size limitation. If the application specifies
             POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the implementation shall ignore the log-
             max-size attribute.
       The default value for the log-full-policy attribute is
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP.
       The posix_trace_attr_getstreamfullpolicy() and
       posix_trace_attr_setstreamfullpolicy() functions, respectively, shall
       get and set the trace stream full policy stored in the stream-full-
       policy attribute of the attributes object pointed to by the attr
       argument.
       The stream-full-policy attribute shall be set to one of the following
       values defined by manifest constants in the <trace.h> header:
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP
             The trace stream shall loop until explicitly stopped by the
             posix_trace_stop() function. This policy means that when the
             trace stream is full, the trace system shall reuse the
             resources allocated to the oldest trace events recorded. In
             this way, the trace stream will always contain the most recent
             trace events recorded.
       POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL
             The trace stream will run until the trace stream resources are
             exhausted. Then the trace stream will stop. This condition can
             be deduced from posix_stream_status and
             posix_stream_full_status (see the posix_trace_status_info
             structure defined in <trace.h>).  When this trace stream is
             read, a POSIX_TRACE_STOP trace event shall be reported after
             reporting the last recorded trace event.  The trace system
             shall reuse the resources allocated to any trace events already
             reported—see the posix_trace_getnext_event(),
             posix_trace_trygetnext_event(), and
             posix_trace_timedgetnext_event() functions—or already flushed
             for an active trace stream with log if the Trace Log option is
             supported; see the posix_trace_flush() function. The trace
             system shall restart the trace stream when it is empty and may
             restart it sooner. A POSIX_TRACE_START trace event shall be
             reported before reporting the next recorded trace event.
       POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH
             If the Trace Log option is supported, this policy is identical
             to the POSIX_TRACE_UNTIL_FULL trace stream full policy except
             that the trace stream shall be flushed regularly as if
             posix_trace_flush() had been explicitly called. Defining this
             policy for an active trace stream without log shall be invalid.
       The default value for the stream-full-policy attribute shall be
       POSIX_TRACE_LOOP for an active trace stream without log.
       If the Trace Log option is supported, the default value for the
       stream-full-policy attribute shall be POSIX_TRACE_FLUSH for an active
       trace stream with log.
