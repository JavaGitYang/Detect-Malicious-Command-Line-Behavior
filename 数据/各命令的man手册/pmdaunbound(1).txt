       pmdaunbound is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about the Unbound DNS resolver using the
       unbound-control(8) stats_noreset command.
       This gives lots of insight into query types, response time, cache
       hits/misses, etc. Please see the unbound-control(8) man page for
       explanation about each statistics counter.
       Further details on the Unbound DNS resolver can be found at
