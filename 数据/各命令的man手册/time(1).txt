       The time command runs the specified program command with the given
       arguments.  When command finishes, time writes a message to standard
       error giving timing statistics about this program run.  These
       statistics consist of (i) the elapsed real time between invocation
       and termination, (ii) the user CPU time (the sum of the tms_utime and
       tms_cutime values in a struct tms as returned by times(2)), and (iii)
       the system CPU time (the sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime values
       in a struct tms as returned by times(2)).
       Note: some shells (e.g., bash(1)) have a built-in time command that
       provides similar information on the usage of time and possibly other
       resources.  To access the real command, you may need to specify its
       pathname (something like /usr/bin/time).
