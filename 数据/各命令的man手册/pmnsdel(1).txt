       pmnsdel removes subtrees of names from a Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), as used by the components of the Performance Co-Pilot
       (PCP).
       Normally pmnsdel operates on the default Performance Metrics Name
       Space (PMNS), however if the -n option is specified an alternative
       namespace is used from the file namespace.
       The default PMNS is found in the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root unless
       the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT is set, in which case the value
       is assumed to be the pathname to the file containing the default
       PMNS.
       The metric names to be deleted are all those for which one of the
       metricpath arguments is a prefix in the PMNS, see pmns(5).
       All of the files defining the PMNS must be located within the
       directory that contains the root of the PMNS, and this would
       typically be $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns for the default PMNS, and this would
       typically imply running pmnsdel as root.
       Provided some initial integrity checks are satisfied, pmnsdel will
       update the necessary PMNS files.  Should an error be encountered the
       original namespace is restored.  Note that any PMNS files that are no
       longer referenced by the modified namespace will not be removed, even
       though their contents are not part of the new namespace.
