       The mkdtemp() function uses the contents of template to construct a
       unique directory name. The string provided in template shall be a
       pathname ending with six trailing 'X's.  The mkdtemp() function shall
       replace each 'X' with a character from the portable filename
       character set. The characters are chosen such that the resulting name
       does not duplicate the name of an existing file at the time of a call
       to mkdtemp().  The unique directory name is used to attempt to create
       the directory using mode 0700 as modified by the file creation mask.
       The mkstemp() function shall replace the contents of the string
       pointed to by template by a unique pathname, and return a file
       descriptor for the file open for reading and writing. The mkstemp()
       function shall create the file, and obtain a file descriptor for it,
       as if by a call to:
           open(pathname, O_RDWR|O_CREAT|O_EXCL, S_IRUSR|S_IWUSR)
       The function thus prevents any possible race condition between
       testing whether the file exists and opening it for use. The string in
       template should look like a pathname with six trailing 'X's;
       mkstemp() replaces each 'X' with a character from the portable
       filename character set. The characters are chosen such that the
       resulting name does not duplicate the name of an existing file at the
       time of a call to mkstemp().
