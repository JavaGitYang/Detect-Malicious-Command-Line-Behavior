       The function post_form displays a form to its associated subwindow.
       To trigger physical display of the subwindow, use refresh(3X) or some
       equivalent curses routine (the implicit doupdate triggered by an
       curses input request will do).
       The function unpost_form erases form from its associated subwindow.
