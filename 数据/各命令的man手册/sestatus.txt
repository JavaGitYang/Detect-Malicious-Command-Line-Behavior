       The sestatus.conf file is used by the sestatus(8) command with the -v
       option to determine what file and process security contexts should be
       displayed.
       The fully qualified path name of the configuration file is:
              /etc/sestatus.conf
       The file consists of two optional sections as described in the FILE
       FORMAT section. Whether these exist or not, the following will always
       be displayed:
              The current process context
              The init process context
              The controlling terminal file context
