       In the current Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
       (PMAPI) context, locate the description of the instance domain indom,
       and return via instlist the internal instance identifiers for all
       instances, and via namelist the full external identifiers for all
       instances.  The number of instances found is returned as the function
       value (else less than zero to indicate an error).
       The value for the instance domain indom is typically extracted from a
       pmDesc structure, following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a
       particular performance metric.
       The resulting lists of instance identifiers (instlist and namelist),
       and the names that the elements of namelist point to, will have been
       allocated by pmGetInDom with two calls to malloc(3), and it is the
       responsibility of the caller to free(instlist) and free(namelist) to
       release the space when it is no longer required.
       When the result of pmGetInDom is less than one, both instlist and
       namelist are undefined (no space will have been allocated, and so
       calling free(3) is a singularly bad idea).
