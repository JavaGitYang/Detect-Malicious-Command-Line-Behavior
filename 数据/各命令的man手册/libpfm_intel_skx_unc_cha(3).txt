       The library supports the Intel Skylake X CHA-Box (coherency and home
       agent engine) uncore PMU.  There is one CHA-box PMU per physical
       core. Therefore there are up to twenty-eight identical CHA-Box PMU
       instances numbered from 0 up to possibly 27. On dual-socket systems,
       the number refers to the CHA-Box PMU on the socket where the program
       runs. For instance, if running on CPU18, then skx_unc_cha0 refers to
       the CHA-Box for physical core 0 on socket 1. Conversely, if running
       on CPU0, then the same skx_unc_cha0 refers to the CHA-Box for
       physical core 0 but on socket 0.
       Each CHA-Box PMU implements 4 generic counters and two filter
       registers used only with certain events and umasks. The filters are
       either accessed via modifiers (see below) or umasks, such as the
       opcode or cache state filter.
