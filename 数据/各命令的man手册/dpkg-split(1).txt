       dpkg-split splits Debian binary package files into smaller parts and
       reassembles them again, to support the storage of large package files
       on small media such as floppy disks.
       It can be operated manually using the --split, --join and --info
       options.
       It also has an automatic mode, invoked using the --auto option, where
       it maintains a queue of parts seen but not yet reassembled and
       reassembles a package file when it has seen all of its parts. The
       --listq and --discard options allow the management of the queue.
       All splitting, joining and queueing operations produce informative
       messages on standard output; these may safely be ignored.
