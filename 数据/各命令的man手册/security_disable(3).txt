       security_disable() disables the SELinux kernel code, unregisters
       selinuxfs from /proc/filesystems, and then unmounts /sys/fs/selinux.
       This function can only be called at runtime and prior to the initial
       policy load. After the initial policy load, the SELinux kernel code
       cannot be disabled, but only placed in "permissive" mode by using
       security_setenforce(3).
