       The comm utility shall read file1 and file2, which should be ordered
       in the current collating sequence, and produce three text columns as
       output: lines only in file1, lines only in file2, and lines in both
       files.
       If the lines in both files are not ordered according to the collating
       sequence of the current locale, the results are unspecified.
