       These functions convert the byte encoding of integer values from the
       byte order that the current CPU (the "host") uses, to and from
       little-endian and big-endian byte order.
       The number, nn, in the name of each function indicates the size of
       integer handled by the function, either 16, 32, or 64 bits.
       The functions with names of the form "htobenn" convert from host byte
       order to big-endian order.
       The functions with names of the form "htolenn" convert from host byte
       order to little-endian order.
       The functions with names of the form "benntoh" convert from big-
       endian order to host byte order.
       The functions with names of the form "lenntoh" convert from little-
       endian order to host byte order.
