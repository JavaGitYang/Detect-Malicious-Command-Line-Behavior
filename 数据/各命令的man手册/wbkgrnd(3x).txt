   bkgrndset
       The bkgrndset and wbkgrndset routines manipulate the background of
       the named window.  The window background is a cchar_t consisting of
       any combination of attributes (i.e., rendition) and a complex
       character.  The attribute part of the background is combined (OR'ed)
       with all non-blank characters that are written into the window with
       waddch.  Both the character and attribute parts of the background are
       combined with the blank characters.  The background becomes a
       property of the character and moves with the character through any
       scrolling and insert/delete line/character operations.
       To the extent possible on a particular terminal, the attribute part
       of the background is displayed as the graphic rendition of the
       character put on the screen.
   bkgrnd
       The bkgrnd and wbkgrnd functions set the background property of the
       current or specified window and then apply this setting to every
       character position in that window:
       ·   The rendition of every character on the screen is changed to the
           new background rendition.
       ·   Wherever the former background character appears, it is changed
           to the new background character.
   getbkgrnd
       The getbkgrnd function returns the given window's current background
       character/attribute pair via the wch pointer.  If the given window
       pointer is null, the character is not updated (but no error
       returned).
