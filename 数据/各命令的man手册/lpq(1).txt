       lpq shows the current print queue status on the named printer.  Jobs
       queued on the default destination will be shown if no printer or
       class is specified on the command-line.
       The +interval option allows you to continuously report the jobs in
       the queue until the queue is empty; the list of jobs is shown once
       every interval seconds.
