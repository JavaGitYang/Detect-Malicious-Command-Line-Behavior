       These functions calculate the complex argument (also called phase
       angle) of z, with a branch cut along the negative real axis.
       A complex number can be described by two real coordinates.  One may
       use rectangular coordinates and gets
           z = x + I * y
       where x = creal(z) and y = cimag(z).
       Or one may use polar coordinates and gets
           z = r * cexp(I * a)
       where r = cabs(z) is the "radius", the "modulus", the absolute value
       of z, and a = carg(z) is the "phase angle", the argument of z.
       One has:
           tan(carg(z)) = cimag(z) / creal(z)
