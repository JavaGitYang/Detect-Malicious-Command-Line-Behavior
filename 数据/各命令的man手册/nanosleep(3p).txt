       The nanosleep() function shall cause the current thread to be
       suspended from execution until either the time interval specified by
       the rqtp argument has elapsed or a signal is delivered to the calling
       thread, and its action is to invoke a signal-catching function or to
       terminate the process. The suspension time may be longer than
       requested because the argument value is rounded up to an integer
       multiple of the sleep resolution or because of the scheduling of
       other activity by the system. But, except for the case of being
       interrupted by a signal, the suspension time shall not be less than
       the time specified by rqtp, as measured by the system clock
       CLOCK_REALTIME.
       The use of the nanosleep() function has no effect on the action or
       blockage of any signal.
