       pmdapostgresql is a Performance Co-Pilot PMDA which extracts live
       performance data from a running PostgreSQL database.
       Many of the staticstics available from a PostgreSQL server may not be
       enabled by default.  Refer to the online documentation at
       https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html 
       which describes each of the available parameters related to
       statistics collection and how to enable them.
