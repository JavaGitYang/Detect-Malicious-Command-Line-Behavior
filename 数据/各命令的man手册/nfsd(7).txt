       The nfsd filesystem is a special filesystem which provides access to
       the Linux NFS server.  The filesystem consists of a single directory
       which contains a number of files.  These files are actually gateways
       into the NFS server.  Writing to them can affect the server.  Reading
       from them can provide information about the server.
       This file system is only available in Linux 2.6 and later series
       kernels (and in the later parts of the 2.5 development series leading
       up to 2.6).  This man page does not apply to 2.4 and earlier.
       As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of files in the
       procfs filesystem (normally mounted at /proc) which are used to
       control the NFS server.  This manual page describes all of these
       files.
       The exportfs and mountd programs (part of the nfs-utils package)
       expect to find this filesystem mounted at /proc/fs/nfsd or
       /proc/fs/nfs.  If it is not mounted, they will fall-back on 2.4 style
       functionality.  This involves accessing the NFS server via a
       systemcall.  This systemcall is scheduled to be removed after the 2.6
       kernel series.
