       The nextup(), nextupf(), and nextupl() functions return the next
       representable floating-point number greater than x.
       If x is the smallest representable negative number in the
       corresponding type, these functions return -0.  If x is 0, the
       returned value is the smallest representable positive number of the
       corresponding type.
       If x is positive infinity, the returned value is positive infinity.
       If x is negative infinity, the returned value is the largest
       representable finite negative number of the corresponding type.
       If x is Nan, the returned value is NaN.
       The value returned by nextdown(x) is -nextup(-x), and similarly for
       the other types.
