       Given a performance metric type, pmTypeStr produces a terse ASCII
       equivalent, appropriate for use in error and diagnostic messages.
       The pmTypeStr_r function does the same, but stores the result in a
       user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for
       at least 20 bytes.
       The value for type is typically extracted from a pmDesc structure,
       following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
       metric.
       Examples are 32 (for type equals PM_TYPE_32), U64 (for type equals
       PM_TYPE_U64), STRING (for type equals PM_TYPE_STRING), etc.
