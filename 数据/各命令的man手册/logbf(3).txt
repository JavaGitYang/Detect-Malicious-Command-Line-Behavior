       These functions extract the exponent from the internal floating-point
       representation of x and return it as a floating-point value.  The
       integer constant FLT_RADIX, defined in <float.h>, indicates the radix
       used for the system's floating-point representation.  If FLT_RADIX is
       2, logb(x) is equal to floor(log2(x)), except that it is probably
       faster.
       If x is subnormal, logb() returns the exponent x would have if it
       were normalized.
