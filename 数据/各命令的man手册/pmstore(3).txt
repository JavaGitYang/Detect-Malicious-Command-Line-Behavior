       In some special cases it may be helpful to modify the current values
       of performance metrics, e.g. to reset a counter to zero, or to modify
       a ``metric'' which is a control variable for some agent collecting
       performance metrics.
       The routine pmStore is a lightweight inverse of pmFetch(3).
       The caller must build the pmResult data structure (of course, this
       could have been returned from an earlier pmFetch(3) call) and then
       call pmStore.
       It is an error to pass a request to pmStore in which the numval field
       within any of the pmValueSet structure has a value less than one.
       The current Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface
       (PMAPI) context must be one with a host as the source of metrics, and
       the current value of the nominated metrics will be changed, i.e.
       pmStore cannot be used to make retrospective changes to information
       in either the archive logs, or in the recent past for real-time
       sources of metrics.
       The return code from pmStore is zero for success.
