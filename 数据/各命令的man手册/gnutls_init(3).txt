       This function initializes the provided session. Every session must be
       initialized before use, and must be deinitialized after used by
       calling gnutls_deinit().
        flags can be any combination of flags from gnutls_init_flags_t.
       Note that since version 3.1.2 this function enables some common TLS
       extensions such as session tickets and OCSP certificate status
       request in client side by default. To prevent that use the
       GNUTLS_NO_EXTENSIONS flag.
