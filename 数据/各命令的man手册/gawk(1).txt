       Gawk is the GNU Project's implementation of the AWK programming
       language.  It conforms to the definition of the language in the POSIX
       1003.1 standard.  This version in turn is based on the description in
       The AWK Programming Language, by Aho, Kernighan, and Weinberger.
       Gawk provides the additional features found in the current version of
       Brian Kernighan's awk and numerous GNU-specific extensions.
       The command line consists of options to gawk itself, the AWK program
       text (if not supplied via the -f or -i options), and values to be
       made available in the ARGC and ARGV pre-defined AWK variables.
       When gawk is invoked with the --profile option, it starts gathering
       profiling statistics from the execution of the program.  Gawk runs
       more slowly in this mode, and automatically produces an execution
       profile in the file awkprof.out when done.  See the --profile option,
       below.
       Gawk also has an integrated debugger. An interactive debugging
       session can be started by supplying the --debug option to the command
       line. In this mode of execution, gawk loads the AWK source code and
       then prompts for debugging commands.  Gawk can only debug AWK program
       source provided with the -f option.  The debugger is documented in
       GAWK: Effective AWK Programming.
