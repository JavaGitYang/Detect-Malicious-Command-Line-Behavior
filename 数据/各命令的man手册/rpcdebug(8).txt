       The rpcdebug command allows an administrator to set and clear the
       Linux kernel's NFS client and server debug flags.  Setting these
       flags causes the kernel to emit messages to the system log in
       response to NFS activity; this is typically useful when debugging NFS
       problems.
       The first form in the synopsis can be used to list all available
       debug flags.  The second form shows the currently set debug flags for
       the given module.  The third form sets one or more flags, and the
       fourth form clears one or more flags.
       The value all may be used to set or clear all the flags for the given
       module.
