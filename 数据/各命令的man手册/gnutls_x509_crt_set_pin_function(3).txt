       This function will set a callback function to be used when it is
       required to access a protected object. This function overrides the
       global function set using gnutls_pkcs11_set_pin_function().
       Note that this callback is currently used only during the import of a
       PKCS 11 certificate with gnutls_x509_crt_import_url().
