       The detachstate attribute controls whether the thread is created in a
       detached state.  If the thread is created detached, then use of the
       ID of the newly created thread by the pthread_detach() or
       pthread_join() function is an error.
       The pthread_attr_getdetachstate() and pthread_attr_setdetachstate()
       functions, respectively, shall get and set the detachstate attribute
       in the attr object.
       For pthread_attr_getdetachstate(), detachstate shall be set to either
       PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
       For pthread_attr_setdetachstate(), the application shall set
       detachstate to either PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED or
       PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
       A value of PTHREAD_CREATE_DETACHED shall cause all threads created
       with attr to be in the detached state, whereas using a value of
       PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE shall cause all threads created with attr to
       be in the joinable state. The default value of the detachstate
       attribute shall be PTHREAD_CREATE_JOINABLE.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getdetachstate() or pthread_attr_setdetachstate()
       does not refer to an initialized thread attributes object.
