       dh_fixperms is a debhelper program that is responsible for setting
       the permissions of files and directories in package build directories
       to a sane state -- a state that complies with Debian policy.
       dh_fixperms makes all files in usr/share/doc in the package build
       directory (excluding files in the examples/ directory) be mode 644.
       It also changes the permissions of all man pages to mode 644. It
       removes group and other write permission from all files. It removes
       execute permissions from any libraries, headers, Perl modules, or
       desktop files that have it set. It makes all files in the standard
       bin and sbin directories, usr/games/ and etc/init.d executable (since
       v4). Finally, it removes the setuid and setgid bits from all files in
       the package.
       When the Rules-Requires-Root field has the (effective) value of
       binary-targets, dh_fixperms will also reset the ownership of all
       paths to "root:root".
