       mmroff is a simple preprocessor for groff; it is used for expanding
       cross references in mm, see groff_mm(7).  groff is executed twice,
       first with -z and -rRef=1 to collect all cross references and then to
       do the real processing when the cross reference file is up to date.
       -x     Just create the cross reference file.  This can be used to
              refresh the cross reference file; it isn't always needed to
              have accurate cross references and by using this option groff
              will only be run once.
