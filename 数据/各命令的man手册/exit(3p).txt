       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The value of status may be 0, EXIT_SUCCESS, EXIT_FAILURE, or any
       other value, though only the least significant 8 bits (that is,
       status & 0377) shall be available to a waiting parent process.
       The exit() function shall first call all functions registered by
       atexit(), in the reverse order of their registration, except that a
       function is called after any previously registered functions that had
       already been called at the time it was registered. Each function is
       called as many times as it was registered. If, during the call to any
       such function, a call to the longjmp() function is made that would
       terminate the call to the registered function, the behavior is
       undefined.
       If a function registered by a call to atexit() fails to return, the
       remaining registered functions shall not be called and the rest of
       the exit() processing shall not be completed. If exit() is called
       more than once, the behavior is undefined.
       The exit() function shall then flush all open streams with unwritten
       buffered data and close all open streams. Finally, the process shall
       be terminated with the same consequences as described in Consequences
       of Process Termination.
