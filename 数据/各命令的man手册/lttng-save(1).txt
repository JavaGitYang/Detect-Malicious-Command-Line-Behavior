       The lttng save command saves the configurations of one or more
       tracing sessions to files.
       The lttng save command is used in conjunction with the lttng-load(1)
       command to save and restore the complete configurations of tracing
       sessions. This includes the enabled channels and event rules, the
       context added to channels, the tracing activity, and more. lttng save
       does not save tracing data, only the tracing session parameters.
       If SESSION is omitted, all the existing tracing session
       configurations are saved (equivalent to using the --all option).
       Otherwise, SESSION is the name of an existing tracing session. lttng
       list outputs all the existing tracing sessions (see lttng-list(1)).
       The default output directory path is $LTTNG_HOME/.lttng/sessions
       ($LTTNG_HOME defaults to $HOME). Each tracing session configuration
       file is named SESSION.lttng, where SESSION is the original tracing
       session name. The default output directory path can be overridden
       with the --output-path option.
       By default, existing tracing session configuration files are not
       overwritten when saving; the command fails. The --force option can be
       used to allow this.
