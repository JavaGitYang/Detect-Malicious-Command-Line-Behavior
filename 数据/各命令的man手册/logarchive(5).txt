       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archives store historical values about
       arbitrary metrics recorded from a single host.  Archives are machine
       independent and self-contained - all metadata required for off-line
       or off-site analysis is stored.
       The format is stable in order to allow long-term historical storage
       and processing by PMAPI client tools.
       Archives may be read by most PCP client tools, using the -a/--archive
       NAME option, or dumped raw by pmdumplog(1).  Archives are created
       primarily by pmlogger(1), however they can also be created using the
       LOGIMPORT(3) programming interface.
       Archives may be merged, analyzed, modified and subsampled using
       pmlogreduce(1), pmlogsummary(1), pmlogrewrite(1) and pmlogextract(1).
       In addition, PCP archives may be examined in sets or grouped together
       into "archive folios", which are created and managed by the mkaf(1)
       and pmafm(1) tools.
       Archives consist of several physical files that share a common
       arbitrary prefix, e.g.  myarchive.
       myarchive.0, myarchive.1, ...
              One or more data volumes containing the metric values and any
              error codes encountered during metric sampling.  Typically the
              largest of the files and may grow very rapidly, depending on
              the pmlogger sampling interval(s) being used.
       myarchive.meta
              Information for PMAPI functions such as pmLookupDesc(3),
              pmLookupLabels(3) and pmLookupInDom(3).  The metadata file may
              grow sporadically as logged metrics, instance domains and
              labels vary over time.
       myarchive.index
              A temporal index, mapping timestamps to offsets in the other
              files.
