       The posix_trace_clear() function shall reinitialize the trace stream
       identified by the argument trid as if it were returning from the
       posix_trace_create() function, except that the same allocated
       resources shall be reused, the mapping of trace event type
       identifiers to trace event names shall be unchanged, and the trace
       stream status shall remain unchanged (that is, if it was running, it
       remains running and if it was suspended, it remains suspended).
       All trace events in the trace stream recorded before the call to
       posix_trace_clear() shall be lost. The posix_stream_full_status
       status shall be set to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL.  There is no guarantee
       that all trace events that occurred during the posix_trace_clear()
       call are recorded; the behavior with respect to trace points that may
       occur during this call is unspecified.
       If the Trace Log option is supported and the trace stream has been
       created with a log, the posix_trace_clear() function shall
       reinitialize the trace stream with the same behavior as if the trace
       stream was created without the log, plus it shall reinitialize the
       trace log associated with the trace stream identified by the argument
       trid as if it were returning from the posix_trace_create_withlog()
       function, except that the same allocated resources, for the trace
       log, may be reused and the associated trace stream status remains
       unchanged.  The first trace event recorded in the trace log after the
       call to posix_trace_clear() shall be the same as the first trace
       event recorded in the active trace stream after the call to
       posix_trace_clear().  The posix_log_full_status status shall be set
       to POSIX_TRACE_NOT_FULL. There is no guarantee that all trace events
       that occurred during the posix_trace_clear() call are recorded in the
       trace log; the behavior with respect to trace points that may occur
       during this call is unspecified. If the log full policy is
       POSIX_TRACE_APPEND, the effect of a call to this function is
       unspecified for the trace log associated with the trace stream
       identified by the trid argument.
