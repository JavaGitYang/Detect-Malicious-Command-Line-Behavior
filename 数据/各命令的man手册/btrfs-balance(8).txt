       The primary purpose of the balance feature is to spread block groups
       across all devices so they match constraints defined by the
       respective profiles. See mkfs.btrfs(8) section PROFILES for more
       details. The scope of the balancing process can be further tuned by
       use of filters that can select the block groups to process. Balance
       works only on a mounted filesystem.
       The balance operation is cancellable by the user. The on-disk state
       of the filesystem is always consistent so an unexpected interruption
       (eg. system crash, reboot) does not corrupt the filesystem. The
       progress of the balance operation is temporarily stored as an
       internal state and will be resumed upon mount, unless the mount
       option skip_balance is specified.
           Warning
           running balance without filters will take a lot of time as it
           basically rewrites the entire filesystem and needs to update all
           block pointers.
       The filters can be used to perform following actions:
       ·   convert block group profiles (filter convert)
       ·   make block group usage more compact (filter usage)
       ·   perform actions only on a given device (filters devid, drange)
       The filters can be applied to a combination of block group types
       (data, metadata, system). Note that changing system needs the force
       option.
           Note
           the balance operation needs enough work space, ie. space that is
           completely unused in the filesystem, otherwise this may lead to
           ENOSPC reports. See the section ENOSPC for more details.
