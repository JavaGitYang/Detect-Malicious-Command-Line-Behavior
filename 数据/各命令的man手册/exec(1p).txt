       The exec utility shall open, close, and/or copy file descriptors as
       specified by any redirections as part of the command.
       If exec is specified without command or arguments, and any file
       descriptors with numbers greater than 2 are opened with associated
       redirection statements, it is unspecified whether those file
       descriptors remain open when the shell invokes another utility.
       Scripts concerned that child shells could misuse open file
       descriptors can always close them explicitly, as shown in one of the
       following examples.
       If exec is specified with command, it shall replace the shell with
       command without creating a new process. If arguments are specified,
       they shall be arguments to command.  Redirection affects the current
       shell execution environment.
