       hostnamectl may be used to query and change the system hostname and
       related settings.
       This tool distinguishes three different hostnames: the high-level
       "pretty" hostname which might include all kinds of special characters
       (e.g. "Lennart's Laptop"), the static hostname which is used to
       initialize the kernel hostname at boot (e.g. "lennarts-laptop"), and
       the transient hostname which is a fallback value received from
       network configuration. If a static hostname is set, and is valid
       (something other than localhost), then the transient hostname is not
       used.
       Note that the pretty hostname has little restrictions on the
       characters and length used, while the static and transient hostnames
       are limited to the usually accepted characters of Internet domain
       names, and 64 characters at maximum (the latter being a Linux
       limitation).
       The static hostname is stored in /etc/hostname, see hostname(5) for
       more information. The pretty hostname, chassis type, and icon name
       are stored in /etc/machine-info, see machine-info(5).
       Use systemd-firstboot(1) to initialize the system host name for
       mounted (but not booted) system images.
