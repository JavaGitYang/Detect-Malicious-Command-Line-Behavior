       The seccomp_api_get() function returns an integer representing the
       functionality ("API level") provided by the current running kernel.
       It is important to note that while seccomp_api_get() can be called
       multiple times, the kernel is only probed the first time to see what
       functionality is supported, all following calls to seccomp_api_get()
       return a cached value.
       The seccomp_api_set() function allows callers to force the API level
       to the provided value; however, this is almost always a bad idea and
       use of this function is strongly discouraged.
       The different API level values are described below:
       0      Reserved value, not currently used.
       1      Base level support.
       2      The SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_TSYNC filter attribute is supported and
              libseccomp uses the seccomp(2) syscall to load the seccomp
              filter into the kernel.
       3      The SCMP_FLTATR_CTL_LOG filter attribute and the SCMP_ACT_LOG
              action are supported.
