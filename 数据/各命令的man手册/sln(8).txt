       The sln program creates symbolic links.  Unlike the ln(1) program, it
       is statically linked.  This means that if for some reason the dynamic
       linker is not working, sln can be used to make symbolic links to
       dynamic libraries.
       The command line has two forms.  In the first form, it creates dest
       as a new symbolic link to source.
       In the second form, filelist is a list of space-separated pathname
       pairs, and the effect is as if sln was executed once for each line of
       the file, with the two pathnames as the arguments.
       The sln program supports no command-line options.
