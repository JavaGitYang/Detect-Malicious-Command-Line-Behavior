       The ftok() function uses the identity of the file named by the given
       pathname (which must refer to an existing, accessible file) and the
       least significant 8 bits of proj_id (which must be nonzero) to
       generate a key_t type System V IPC key, suitable for use with
       msgget(2), semget(2), or shmget(2).
       The resulting value is the same for all pathnames that name the same
       file, when the same value of proj_id is used.  The value returned
       should be different when the (simultaneously existing) files or the
       project IDs differ.
