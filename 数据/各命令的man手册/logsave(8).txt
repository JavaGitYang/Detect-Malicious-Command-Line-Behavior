       The logsave program will execute cmd_prog with the specified
       argument(s), and save a copy of its output to logfile.  If the
       containing directory for logfile does not exist, logsave will
       accumulate the output in memory until it can be written out.  A copy
       of the output will also be written to standard output.
       If cmd_prog is a single hyphen ('-'), then instead of executing a
       program, logsave will take its input from standard input and save it
       in logfile
       logsave is useful for saving the output of initial boot scripts until
       the /var partition is mounted, so the output can be written to
       /var/log.
