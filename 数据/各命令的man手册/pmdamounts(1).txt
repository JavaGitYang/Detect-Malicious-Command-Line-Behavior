       pmdamounts is a simple Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       monitors availability of a given set of filesystem mounts.
       The mounts PMDA exports metrics that reflect whether the configured
       filesystems are mounted ("up") or not.  The list of mount points to
       monitor is specified via the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/mounts.conf file
       which simply contains one line for each mount point.
       A brief description of the pmdamounts command line options follows:
       -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
            number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is, domain
            should be different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
            domain number should be used for the same PMDA on all hosts.
       -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
            mounts.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
            pmdamounts is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log file
            cannot be created or is not writable, output is written to the
            standard error instead.
       -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is the
            unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP, but in
            older versions the superuser account ("root") was used by
            default.
