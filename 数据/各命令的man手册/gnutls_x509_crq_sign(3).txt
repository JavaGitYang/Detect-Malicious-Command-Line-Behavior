       This function is the same a gnutls_x509_crq_sign2() with no flags,
       and an appropriate hash algorithm. The hash algorithm used may vary
       between versions of GnuTLS, and it is tied to the security level of
       the issuer's public key.
       A known limitation of this function is, that a newly-signed request
       will not be fully functional (e.g., for signature verification),
       until it is exported an re-imported.
