       The replace utility program changes strings in place in files or on
       the standard input.
       Invoke replace in one of the following ways:
           shell> replace from to [from to] ... -- file_name [file_name] ...
           shell> replace from to [from to] ... < file_name
       from represents a string to look for and to represents its
       replacement. There can be one or more pairs of strings.
       Use the -- option to indicate where the string-replacement list ends
       and the file names begin. In this case, any file named on the command
       line is modified in place, so you may want to make a copy of the
       original before converting it.  replace prints a message indicating
       which of the input files it actually modifies.
       If the -- option is not given, replace reads the standard input and
       writes to the standard output.
       replace uses a finite state machine to match longer strings first. It
       can be used to swap strings. For example, the following command swaps
       a and b in the given files, file1 and file2:
           shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...
       The replace program is used by msql2mysql. See msql2mysql(1).
