       The realpath() function shall derive, from the pathname pointed to by
       file_name, an absolute pathname that resolves to the same directory
       entry, whose resolution does not involve '.', '..', or symbolic
       links. If resolved_name is a null pointer, the generated pathname
       shall be stored as a null-terminated string in a buffer allocated as
       if by a call to malloc().  Otherwise, if {PATH_MAX} is defined as a
       constant in the <limits.h> header, then the generated pathname shall
       be stored as a null-terminated string, up to a maximum of {PATH_MAX}
       bytes, in the buffer pointed to by resolved_name.
       If resolved_name is not a null pointer and {PATH_MAX} is not defined
       as a constant in the <limits.h> header, the behavior is undefined.
