       keyctl_get_keyring_ID() maps a special key or keyring ID to the
       serial number of the key actually representing that feature.  The
       serial number will be returned if that key exists.
       If the key or keyring does not yet exist, then if create is non-zero,
       the key or keyring will be created if it is appropriate to do so.
       The following special key IDs may be specified as key:
       KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's thread-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.
       KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY
              This specifies the authorisation key created by request_key()
              and passed to the process it spawns to generate a key.
       If a valid keyring ID is passed in, then this will simply be returned
       if the key exists; an error will be issued if it doesn't exist.
