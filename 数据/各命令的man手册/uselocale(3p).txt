       The uselocale() function shall set the current locale for the current
       thread to the locale represented by newloc.
       The value for the newloc argument shall be one of the following:
        1. A value returned by the newlocale() or duplocale() functions
        2. The special locale object descriptor LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE
        3. (locale_t)0
       Once the uselocale() function has been called to install a thread-
       local locale, the behavior of every interface using data from the
       current locale shall be affected for the calling thread. The current
       locale for other threads shall remain unchanged.
       If the newloc argument is (locale_t)0, the object returned is the
       current locale or LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE if there has been no previous call
       to uselocale() for the current thread.
       If the newloc argument is LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE, the thread shall use the
       global locale determined by the setlocale() function.
