       For strncpy(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The stpncpy() and strncpy() functions shall copy not more than n
       bytes (bytes that follow a NUL character are not copied) from the
       array pointed to by s2 to the array pointed to by s1.
       If the array pointed to by s2 is a string that is shorter than n
       bytes, NUL characters shall be appended to the copy in the array
       pointed to by s1, until n bytes in all are written.
       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.
