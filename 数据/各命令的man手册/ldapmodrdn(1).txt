       ldapmodrdn is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_rename(3)
       library call.
       ldapmodrdn opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and modifies
       the RDN of entries.  The entry information is read from standard
       input, from file through the use of the -f option, or from the
       command-line pair dn and rdn.
