       mkswap sets up a Linux swap area on a device or in a file.
       The device argument will usually be a disk partition (something like
       /dev/sdb7) but can also be a file.  The Linux kernel does not look at
       partition IDs, but many installation scripts will assume that
       partitions of hex type 82 (LINUX_SWAP) are meant to be swap
       partitions.  (Warning: Solaris also uses this type.  Be careful not
       to kill your Solaris partitions.)
       The size parameter is superfluous but retained for backwards
       compatibility.  (It specifies the desired size of the swap area in
       1024-byte blocks.  mkswap will use the entire partition or file if it
       is omitted.  Specifying it is unwise â€“ a typo may destroy your disk.)
       After creating the swap area, you need the swapon command to start
       using it.  Usually swap areas are listed in /etc/fstab so that they
       can be taken into use at boot time by a swapon -a command in some
       boot script.
