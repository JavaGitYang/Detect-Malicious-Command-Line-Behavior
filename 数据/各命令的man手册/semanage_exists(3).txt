       Behavior:
              The exists function will return 0 if a matching key is not
              found, and 1 otherwise.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The key identifies the object
              being checked. The result of the test will be stored in the
              address pointed by response The key is a property of the
              caller, and will not be stored or modified internally.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) )
