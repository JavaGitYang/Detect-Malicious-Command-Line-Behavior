       The library supports a pseudo PMU model to allow raw encodings of PMU
       events for the Linux perf_events kernel interface.
       With this PMU, it is possible to provide the raw hexadecimal encoding
       of any hardware event for any PMU models. The raw encoding is passed
       as is to the kernel. All events are encoded as PERF_TYPE_RAW. As
       such, perf_events generic events, such as cycles, instructions,
       cannot be encoded by this PMU.
       The syntax is very simple: rX. X is the hexadecimal 64-bit value for
       the event.  It may include event filters on some PMU models. The
       hexadecimal number is passed without the 0x prefix, e.g., r01c4.
       The library's standard perf_events attributes are supported by this
       PMU model.  They are separated with colons as is customary with the
       library.
