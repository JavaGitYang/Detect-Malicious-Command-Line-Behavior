       pmerr accepts standard Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) error codes via the
       code argument(s) and generates the corresponding error text.
       Each code may be an integer, a hexadecimal value or a hexadecimal
       value prefixed by either ``0x'' or ``0X''.
       Error codes must be less than zero, so if code is a positive number,
       a warning message is produced, and the negated value is used.
       The alternative use of the -l option causes all known error codes to
       be listed, along with their symbolic names and error text.
