       If $MANPATH is set, manpath will simply display its contents and
       issue a warning.  If not, manpath will determine a suitable manual
       page hierarchy search path and display the results.
       The colon-delimited path is determined using information gained from
       the man-db configuration file - (/usr/local/etc/man_db.conf) and the
       user's environment.
