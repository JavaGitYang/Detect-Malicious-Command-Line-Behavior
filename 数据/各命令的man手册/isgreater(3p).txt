       The isgreater() macro shall determine whether its first argument is
       greater than its second argument. The value of isgreater(x, y) shall
       be equal to (x) > (y); however, unlike (x) > (y), isgreater(x, y)
       shall not raise the invalid floating-point exception when x and y are
       unordered.
