       The getrusage() function shall provide measures of the resources used
       by the current process or its terminated and waited-for child
       processes. If the value of the who argument is RUSAGE_SELF,
       information shall be returned about resources used by the current
       process. If the value of the who argument is RUSAGE_CHILDREN,
       information shall be returned about resources used by the terminated
       and waited-for children of the current process. If the child is never
       waited for (for example, if the parent has SA_NOCLDWAIT set or sets
       SIGCHLD to SIG_IGN), the resource information for the child process
       is discarded and not included in the resource information provided by
       getrusage().
       The r_usage argument is a pointer to an object of type struct rusage
       in which the returned information is stored.
