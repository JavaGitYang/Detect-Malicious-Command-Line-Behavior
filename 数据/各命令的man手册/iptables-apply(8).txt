       iptables-apply will try to apply a new ruleset (as output by
       iptables-save/read by iptables-restore) to iptables, then prompt the
       user whether the changes are okay. If the new ruleset cut the
       existing connection, the user will not be able to answer
       affirmatively. In this case, the script rolls back to the previous
       ruleset after the timeout expired. The timeout can be set with -t.
       When called as ip6tables-apply, the script will use
       ip6tables-save/-restore instead.
