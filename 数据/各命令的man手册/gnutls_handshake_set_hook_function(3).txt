       This function will set a callback to be called after or before the
       specified handshake message has been received or generated. This is a
       generalization of gnutls_handshake_set_post_client_hello_function().
       To call the hook function prior to the message being generated or
       processed use GNUTLS_HOOK_PRE as  when parameter, GNUTLS_HOOK_POST to
       call after, and GNUTLS_HOOK_BOTH for both cases.
       This callback must return 0 on success or a gnutls error code to
       terminate the handshake.
       To hook at all handshake messages use an  htype of
       GNUTLS_HANDSHAKE_ANY.
