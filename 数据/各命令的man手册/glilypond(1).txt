       glilypond transforms sheet music written in the lilypond language
       into the groff(7) language using the .PSPIC request, such that
       groff(1) can transform it into a format that can be displayed
       directly.  .PDFPIC is available, but does on yet work with lilypond.
       Files in groff language and standard input can be provided as
       arguments.
