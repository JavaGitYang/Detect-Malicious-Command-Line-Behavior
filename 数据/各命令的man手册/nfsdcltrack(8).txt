       nfsdcltrack is the NFSv4 client tracking callout program. It is not
       necessary to install this program on machines that are not acting as
       NFSv4 servers.
       When a network partition is combined with a server reboot, there are
       edge conditions that can cause the server to grant lock reclaims when
       other clients have taken conflicting locks in the interim. A more
       detailed explanation of this issue is described in RFC 3530, section
       8.6.3 and in RFC 5661, section 8.4.3.
       In order to prevent these problems, the server must track a small
       amount of per-client information on stable storage. This program
       provides the userspace piece of that functionality. When the kernel
       needs to manipulate the database that stores this info, it will
       execute this program to handle it.
