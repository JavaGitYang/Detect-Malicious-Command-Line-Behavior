       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fgetws() function shall read characters from the stream, convert
       these to the corresponding wide-character codes, place them in the
       wchar_t array pointed to by ws, until n−1 characters are read, or a
       <newline> is read, converted, and transferred to ws, or an end-of-
       file condition is encountered. The wide-character string, ws, shall
       then be terminated with a null wide-character code.
       If an error occurs, the resulting value of the file position
       indicator for the stream is unspecified.
       The fgetws() function may mark the last data access timestamp of the
       file associated with stream for update. The last data access
       timestamp shall be marked for update by the first successful
       execution of fgetwc(), fgetws(), fwscanf(), getwc(), getwchar(),
       vfwscanf(), vwscanf(), or wscanf() using stream that returns data not
       supplied by a prior call to ungetwc().
