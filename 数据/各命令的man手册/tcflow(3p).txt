       The tcflow() function shall suspend or restart transmission or
       reception of data on the object referred to by fildes, depending on
       the value of action.  The fildes argument is an open file descriptor
       associated with a terminal.
        *  If action is TCOOFF, output shall be suspended.
        *  If action is TCOON, suspended output shall be restarted.
        *  If action is TCIOFF and fildes refers to a terminal device, the
           system shall transmit a STOP character, which is intended to
           cause the terminal device to stop transmitting data to the
           system. If fildes is associated with a pseudo-terminal, the STOP
           character need not be transmitted.
        *  If action is TCION and fildes refers to a terminal device, the
           system shall transmit a START character, which is intended to
           cause the terminal device to start transmitting data to the
           system. If fildes is associated with a pseudo-terminal, the START
           character need not be transmitted.
       The default on the opening of a terminal file is that neither its
       input nor its output are suspended.
       Attempts to use tcflow() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal, shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
       ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
       operation, and no signal is sent.
