       pcp-collectl is a system-level performance monitoring utility that
       records or displays specific operating system data for one or more
       sets of subsystems.  Any of the subsystems (such as CPU, Disks,
       Memory or Sockets) can be included or excluded from data collection.
       Data can either be displayed immediately to a terminal, or stored in
       files for retrospective analysis.
       pcp-collectl is a python(1) script providing much of the
       functionality available from the collectl(1) Linux utility (which
       happens to be written in perl(1)).
       It makes use of the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) toolkit to simplify
       its implementation, as well as provide more of the collectl
       functionality on platforms other than Linux.
       pcp-collectl has two primary modes of operation:
       1. Record Mode (-f or --filename option) which reads data from a live
          system and writes output to a file or displays it on a terminal.
       2. Playback Mode (-p or -a option) which reads data from one or more
          PCP archive files and displays output on a terminal.  Note that
          these files are not raw collectl format data, rather they are
          archives created by the pmlogger(1) utility (possibly indirectly,
          through use of the -f option to pcp-collectl).
