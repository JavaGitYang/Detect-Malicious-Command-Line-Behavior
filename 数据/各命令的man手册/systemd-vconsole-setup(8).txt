       systemd-vconsole-setup is a helper used to prepare either all virtual
       consoles, or — if the optional TTY parameter is provided — a specific
       one. When the system is booting up it's called by systemd-udevd(8)
       during vtconsole subsystem initialization.  Systemd(TM) also calls it
       internally as needed via systemd-vconsole-setup.service. The helper
       calls loadkeys(1) and setfont(8) internally.
       You may want to use this helper whenever you change vconsole.conf to
       refresh the settings on your consoles — either through the systemctl
       restart / systemctl start command or directly through the executable.
       See vconsole.conf(5) for information about the configuration files
       and kernel command line options understood by this program.
