       The umask() function shall set the file mode creation mask of the
       process to cmask and return the previous value of the mask. Only the
       file permission bits of cmask (see <sys/stat.h>) are used; the
       meaning of the other bits is implementation-defined.
       The file mode creation mask of the process is used to turn off
       permission bits in the mode argument supplied during calls to the
       following functions:
        *  open(), openat(), creat(), mkdir(), mkdirat(), mkfifo(), and
           mkfifoat()
        *  mknod(), mknodat()
        *  mq_open()
        *  sem_open()
       Bit positions that are set in cmask are cleared in the mode of the
       created file.
