       Creates an archive of the specified format containing the tree
       structure for the named tree, and writes it out to the standard
       output. If <prefix> is specified it is prepended to the filenames in
       the archive.
       git archive behaves differently when given a tree ID versus when
       given a commit ID or tag ID. In the first case the current time is
       used as the modification time of each file in the archive. In the
       latter case the commit time as recorded in the referenced commit
       object is used instead. Additionally the commit ID is stored in a
       global extended pax header if the tar format is used; it can be
       extracted using git get-tar-commit-id. In ZIP files it is stored as a
       file comment.
