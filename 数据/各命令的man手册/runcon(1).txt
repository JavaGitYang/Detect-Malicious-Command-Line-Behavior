       Run COMMAND with completely-specified CONTEXT, or with current or
       transitioned security context modified by one or more of LEVEL, ROLE,
       TYPE, and USER.
       If none of -c, -t, -u, -r, or -l, is specified, the first argument is
       used as the complete context.  Any additional arguments after COMMAND
       are interpreted as arguments to the command.
       Note that only carefully-chosen contexts are likely to successfully
       run.
       Run a program in a different SELinux security context.  With neither
       CONTEXT nor COMMAND, print the current security context.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.
