       The alphasort() function can be used as the comparison function for
       the scandir() function to sort the directory entries, d1 and d2, into
       alphabetical order. Sorting happens as if by calling the strcoll()
       function on the d_name element of the dirent structures passed as the
       two parameters. If the strcoll() function fails, the return value of
       alphasort() is unspecified.
       The alphasort() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful. Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error,
       an application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to 0, then call alphasort(), then check errno.
       The scandir() function shall scan the directory dir, calling the
       function referenced by sel on each directory entry. Entries for which
       the function referenced by sel returns non-zero shall be stored in
       strings allocated as if by a call to malloc(), and sorted as if by a
       call to qsort() with the comparison function compar, except that
       compar need not provide total ordering. The strings are collected in
       array namelist which shall be allocated as if by a call to malloc().
       If sel is a null pointer, all entries shall be selected.  If the
       comparison function compar does not provide total ordering, the order
       in which the directory entries are stored is unspecified.
