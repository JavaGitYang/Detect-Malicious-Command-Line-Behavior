       This manual page describes the setfiles program.
       This program is primarily used to initialize the security context
       fields (extended attributes) on one or more filesystems (or parts of
       them).  Usually it is initially run as part of the SELinux
       installation process (a step commonly known as labeling).
       It can also be run at any other time to correct inconsistent labels,
       to add support for newly-installed policy or, by using the -n option,
       to passively check whether the file contexts are all set as specified
       by the active policy (default behavior) or by some other policy (see
       the -c option).
       If a file object does not have a context, setfiles will write the
       default context to the file object's extended attributes. If a file
       object has a context, setfiles will only modify the type portion of
       the security context.  The -F option will force a replacement of the
       entire context.
