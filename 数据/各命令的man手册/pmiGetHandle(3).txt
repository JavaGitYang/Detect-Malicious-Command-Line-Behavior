       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), pmiGetHandle creates a handle for a given metric and
       instance.  The handle is returned as the value from the pmiGetHandle
       call and can be used in subsequent calls to pmiPutValueHandle(3).
       The metric's name should match one defined earlier in a call to
       pmiAddMetric(3).
       For singular metrics (those defined with an instance domain of
       PM_INDOM_NULL), the instance should be NULL or an empty string,
       otherwise instance should match the name of an instance defined
       earlier in a call to pmiAddInstance(3) for the metric's instance
       domain.
       When combined with pmiPutValueHandle(3), the use of handles provide a
       performance improvement over the alternative lookup for a metric name
       and an instance name for each data value that is required for
       pmiPutValue(3).
