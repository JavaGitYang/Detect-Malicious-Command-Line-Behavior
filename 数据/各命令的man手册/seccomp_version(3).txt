       The seccomp_version() and seccomp_reset() functions return a pointer
       to a scmp_version struct which contains the version information of
       the currently loaded libseccomp library.  This function can be used
       by applications that need to verify that they are linked to a
       specific libseccomp version at runtime.
       The caller should not attempt to free the returned scmp_version
       struct when finished.
