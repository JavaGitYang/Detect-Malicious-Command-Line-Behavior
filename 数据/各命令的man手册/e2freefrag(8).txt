       e2freefrag is used to report free space fragmentation on ext2/3/4
       file systems.  filesys is the filesystem device name (e.g.
       /dev/hdc1, /dev/md0).  The e2freefrag program will scan the block
       bitmap information to check how many free blocks are present as
       contiguous and aligned free space. The percentage of contiguous free
       blocks of size and of alignment chunk_kb is reported.  It also
       displays the minimum/maximum/average free chunk size in the
       filesystem, along with a histogram of all free chunks.  This
       information can be used to gauge the level of free space
       fragmentation in the filesystem.
