       This function will initialize an context that can be used to produce
       a Message Authentication Code (MAC) of data.  This will effectively
       use the current crypto backend in use by gnutls or the cryptographic
       accelerator in use.
       Note that despite the name of this function, it can be used for other
       MAC algorithms than HMAC.
