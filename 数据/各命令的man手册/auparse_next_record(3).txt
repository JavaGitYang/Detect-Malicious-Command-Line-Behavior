       auparse_next_record will move the internal library cursors to point
       to the next record of the current event. You should not call this
       function from a feed interface callback function. Doing so will
       deadlock the code. In that scenario, you should check the number of
       records in the current event with auparse_get_num_records and only
       call this if there are more records.
