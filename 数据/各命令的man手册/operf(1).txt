       Operf is the profiler tool provided with OProfile. Operf uses the
       Linux Performance Events Subsystem and, thus, does not require the
       obsolete oprofile kernel driver.
       By default, operf uses <current_dir>/oprofile_data as the session-dir
       and stores profiling data there.  You can change this by way of the
       --session-dir option. The usual post-profiling analysis tools such as
       opreport(1) and opannotate(1) can be used to generate profile
       reports. Unless a session-dir is specified, the post-processing
       analysis tools will search for samples in <current_dir>/oprofile_data
       first. If that directory does not exist, the post-processing tools
       use the standard session-dir of /var/lib/oprofile.
       Statistics, such as total samples received and lost samples, are
       written to the operf.log file that can be found in the
       <session_dir>/samples directory.
