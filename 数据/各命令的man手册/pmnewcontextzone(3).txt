       The current reporting timezone affects the timezone used by
       pmCtime(3) and pmLocaltime(3).
       If the current PMAPI context is an archive, pmNewContextZone uses the
       timezone from the archive label record to set the current reporting
       timezone.
       If the current PMAPI context corresponds to a host source of metrics,
       pmNewContextZone executes a pmFetch(3) to retrieve the value for the
       metric pmcd.timezone and uses that to set the current reporting
       timezone.
       In both cases, pmNewContextZone returns a value to identify the
       current reporting timezone that may be used in a subsequent call to
       pmUseZone(3) to restore this reporting timezone.
