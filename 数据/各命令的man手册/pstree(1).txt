       pstree shows running processes as a tree.  The tree is rooted at
       either pid or init if pid is omitted.  If a user name is specified,
       all process trees rooted at processes owned by that user are shown.
       pstree visually merges identical branches by putting them in square
       brackets and prefixing them with the repetition count, e.g.
           init-+-getty
                |-getty
                |-getty
                `-getty
       becomes
           init---4*[getty]
       Child threads of a process are found under the parent process and are
       shown with the process name in curly braces, e.g.
           icecast2---13*[{icecast2}]
       If pstree is called as pstree.x11 then it will prompt the user at the
       end of the line to press return and will not return until that has
       happened.  This is useful for when pstree is run in a xterminal.
       Certain kernel or mount parameters, such as the hidepid option for
       procfs, will hide information for some processes. In these situations
       pstree will attempt to build the tree without this information,
       showing process names as question marks.
