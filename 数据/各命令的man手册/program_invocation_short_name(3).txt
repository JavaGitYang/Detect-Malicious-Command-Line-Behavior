       program_invocation_name contains the name that was used to invoke the
       calling program.  This is the same as the value of argv[0] in main(),
       with the difference that the scope of program_invocation_name is
       global.
       program_invocation_short_name contains the basename component of name
       that was used to invoke the calling program.  That is, it is the same
       value as program_invocation_name, with all text up to and including
       the final slash (/), if any, removed.
       These variables are automatically initialized by the glibc run-time
       startup code.
