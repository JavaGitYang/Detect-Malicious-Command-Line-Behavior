       This function will extract the response type OID in and the response
       data from an OCSP response.  Normally the
        response_type_oid is always "1.3.6.1.5.5.7.48.1.1" which means the
        response should be decoded as a Basic OCSP Response, but technically
       other response types could be used.
       This function is typically only useful when you want to extract the
       response type OID of an response for diagnostic purposes.  Otherwise
       gnutls_ocsp_resp_import() will decode the basic OCSP response part
       and the caller need not worry about that aspect.
