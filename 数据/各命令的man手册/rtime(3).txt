       This function uses the Time Server Protocol as described in RFC 868
       to obtain the time from a remote machine.
       The Time Server Protocol gives the time in seconds since 00:00:00
       UTC, 1 Jan 1900, and this function subtracts the appropriate constant
       in order to convert the result to seconds since the Epoch, 1970-01-01
       00:00:00 +0000 (UTC).
       When timeout is non-NULL, the udp/time socket (port 37) is used.
       Otherwise, the tcp/time socket (port 37) is used.
