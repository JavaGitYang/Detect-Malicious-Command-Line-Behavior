       This function reads from the Authority Information Access type.
       The  seq input parameter is used to indicate which member of the
       sequence the caller is interested in.  The first member is 0, the
       second member 1 and so on.  When the  seq value is out of bounds,
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned.
       Typically  oid is GNUTLS_OID_AD_CAISSUERS or GNUTLS_OID_AD_OCSP.
