       The iswblank() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isblank(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "blank".
       The wide-character class "blank" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "space".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "space", the wide-
       character class "blank" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "graph" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses "alnum",
       "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit", "punct".
       The wide-character class "blank" always contains at least the space
       character and the control character '\t'.
