       The getgrent() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken-out fields of a record in the group database (e.g., the
       local group file /etc/group, NIS, and LDAP).  The first time
       getgrent() is called, it returns the first entry; thereafter, it
       returns successive entries.
       The setgrent() function rewinds to the beginning of the group
       database, to allow repeated scans.
       The endgrent() function is used to close the group database after all
       processing has been performed.
       The group structure is defined in <grp.h> as follows:
           struct group {
               char   *gr_name;        /* group name */
               char   *gr_passwd;      /* group password */
               gid_t   gr_gid;         /* group ID */
               char  **gr_mem;         /* NULL-terminated array of pointers
                                          to names of group members */
           };
       For more information about the fields of this structure, see
       group(5).
