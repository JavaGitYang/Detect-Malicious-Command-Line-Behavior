       The loadunimap command is obsolete - its function is now built-in
       into setfont.  However, for backwards compatibility it is still
       available as a separate command.
       The program loadunimap loads the specified map in the kernel unicode-
       to-font mapping table.  If no map is given def is assumed.  The
       default extension (that can be omitted) is .uni.
       If the -o oldmap option is given, the old map is saved in the file
       specified.
       On Linux 2.6.1 and later one can specify the console device using the
       -C option.
       Usually one does not call loadunimap directly - its function is also
       built into setfont.
