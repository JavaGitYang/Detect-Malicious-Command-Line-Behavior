       grn is a preprocessor for including gremlin pictures in groff input.
       grn writes to standard output, processing only input lines between
       two that start with .GS and .GE.  Those lines must contain grn
       commands (see below).  These commands request a gremlin file, and the
       picture in that file is converted and placed in the troff input
       stream.  The .GS request may be followed by a C, L, or R to center,
       left, or right justify the whole gremlin picture (default
       justification is center).  If no file is mentioned, the standard
       input is read.  At the end of the picture, the position on the page
       is the bottom of the gremlin picture.  If the grn entry is ended with
       .GF instead of .GE, the position is left at the top of the picture.
       Please note that currently only the -me macro package has support for
       .GS, .GE, and .GF.
       The following command-line options are understood:
       -Tdev  Prepare output for printer dev.  The default device is ps.
              See groff(1) for acceptable devices.
       -Mdir  Prepend dir to the default search path for gremlin files.  The
              default path is (in that order) the current directory, the
              home directory, /usr/local/lib/groff/site-tmac,
              /usr/local/share/groff/site-tmac, and
              /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/tmac.
       -Fdir  Search dir for subdirectories devname (name is the name of the
              device) for the DESC file before the default font directories
              /usr/local/share/groff/site-font,
              /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/font, and /usr/lib/font.
       -C     Recognize .GS and .GE (and .GF) even when followed by a
              character other than space or newline.
       -v     Print the version number.
       It is possible to have whitespace between a command-line option and
       its parameter.
