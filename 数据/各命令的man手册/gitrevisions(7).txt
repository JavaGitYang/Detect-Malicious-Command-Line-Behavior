       Many Git commands take revision parameters as arguments. Depending on
       the command, they denote a specific commit or, for commands which
       walk the revision graph (such as git-log(1)), all commits which are
       reachable from that commit. For commands that walk the revision graph
       one can also specify a range of revisions explicitly.
       In addition, some Git commands (such as git-show(1)) also take
       revision parameters which denote other objects than commits, e.g.
       blobs ("files") or trees ("directories of files").
