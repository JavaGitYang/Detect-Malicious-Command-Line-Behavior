       This manual page documents briefly the rtmon command.
       rtmon listens on netlink socket and monitors routing table changes.
       rtmon can be started before the first network configuration command
       is issued.  For example if you insert:
       rtmon file /var/log/rtmon.log
       in a startup script, you will be able to view the full history later.
       Certainly, it is possible to start rtmon at any time. It prepends the
       history with the state snapshot dumped at the moment of starting.
