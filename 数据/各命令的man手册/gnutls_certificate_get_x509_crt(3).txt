       Obtains a X.509 certificate list that has been stored in  res with
       one of gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key(),
       gnutls_certificate_set_key(), gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file(),
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_file2(),
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem(), or
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key_mem2(). Each certificate in the
       returned certificate list must be deallocated with
       gnutls_x509_crt_deinit(), and the list itself must be freed with
       gnutls_free().
       The  index matches the return value of
       gnutls_certificate_set_x509_key() and friends functions, when the
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 flag is set.
       If there is no certificate with the given index,
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned. If the certificate
       with the given index is not a X.509 certificate,
       GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST is returned. The returned certificates must
       be deinitialized after use, and the  crt_list pointer must be freed
       using gnutls_free().
