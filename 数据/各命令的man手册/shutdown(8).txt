       shutdown may be used to halt, power-off or reboot the machine.
       The first argument may be a time string (which is usually "now").
       Optionally, this may be followed by a wall message to be sent to all
       logged-in users before going down.
       The time string may either be in the format "hh:mm" for hour/minutes
       specifying the time to execute the shutdown at, specified in 24h
       clock format. Alternatively it may be in the syntax "+m" referring to
       the specified number of minutes m from now.  "now" is an alias for
       "+0", i.e. for triggering an immediate shutdown. If no time argument
       is specified, "+1" is implied.
       Note that to specify a wall message you must specify a time argument,
       too.
       If the time argument is used, 5 minutes before the system goes down
       the /run/nologin file is created to ensure that further logins shall
       not be allowed.
