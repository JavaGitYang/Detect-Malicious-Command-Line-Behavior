       Applies a command to all translations of a translation catalog.  The
       COMMAND can be any program that reads a translation from standard
       input.  It is invoked once for each translation.  Its output becomes
       msgexec's output.  msgexec's return code is the maximum return code
       across all invocations.
       A special builtin command called '0' outputs the translation,
       followed by a null byte.  The output of "msgexec 0" is suitable as
       input for "xargs -0".
   Command input:
       --newline
              add newline at the end of input
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options
       too.
   Input file location:
       -i, --input=INPUTFILE
              input PO file
       -D, --directory=DIRECTORY
              add DIRECTORY to list for input files search
       If no input file is given or if it is -, standard input is read.
   Input file syntax:
       -P, --properties-input
              input file is in Java .properties syntax
       --stringtable-input
              input file is in NeXTstep/GNUstep .strings syntax
   Informative output:
       -h, --help
              display this help and exit
       -V, --version
              output version information and exit
