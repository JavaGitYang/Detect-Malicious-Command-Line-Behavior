       write allows you to communicate with other users, by copying lines
       from your terminal to theirs.
       When you run the write command, the user you are writing to gets a
       message of the form:
              Message from yourname@yourhost on yourtty at hh:mm ...
       Any further lines you enter will be copied to the specified user's
       terminal.  If the other user wants to reply, they must run write as
       well.
       When you are done, type an end-of-file or interrupt character.  The
       other user will see the message EOF indicating that the conversation
       is over.
       You can prevent people (other than the superuser) from writing to you
       with the mesg(1) command.  Some commands, for example nroff(1) and
       pr(1), may automatically disallow writing, so that the output they
       produce isn't overwritten.
       If the user you want to write to is logged in on more than one
       terminal, you can specify which terminal to write to by giving the
       terminal name as the second operand to the write command.
       Alternatively, you can let write select one of the terminals - it
       will pick the one with the shortest idle time.  This is so that if
       the user is logged in at work and also dialed up from home, the
       message will go to the right place.
       The traditional protocol for writing to someone is that the string
       `-o', either at the end of a line or on a line by itself, means that
       it's the other person's turn to talk.  The string `oo' means that the
       person believes the conversation to be over.
