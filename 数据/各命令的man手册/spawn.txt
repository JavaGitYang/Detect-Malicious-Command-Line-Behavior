       The <spawn.h> header shall define the posix_spawnattr_t and
       posix_spawn_file_actions_t types used in performing spawn operations.
       The <spawn.h> header shall define the mode_t and pid_t types as
       described in <sys/types.h>.
       The <spawn.h> header shall define the sigset_t type as described in
       <signal.h>.
       The tag sched_param shall be declared as naming an incomplete
       structure type, the contents of which are described in the <sched.h>
       header.
       The <spawn.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants
       for use as the flags that may be set in a posix_spawnattr_t object
       using the posix_spawnattr_setflags() function:
       POSIX_SPAWN_RESETIDS
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETPGROUP
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGDEF
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSIGMASK
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

       Inclusion of the <spawn.h> header may make visible symbols defined in
       the <sched.h> and <signal.h> headers.
       The following sections are informative.
