       The booleans file, if present contains booleans to support a specific
       distribution.
       The booleans.local file, if present contains locally generated
       booleans.
       Both files contain a list of boolean names and their associated
       values.
       Generally the booleans and/or booleans.local files are not present
       (they have been deprecated). However if there is an SELinux-aware
       application that uses the libselinux functions listed below, then
       these files may be present:
              security_set_boolean_list(3)
                     Writes a booleans.local file if flag permanent = 1.
              security_load_booleans(3)
                     Looks for a booleans and/or booleans.local file at
                     selinux_booleans_path(3) unless a specific path is
                     specified as a parameter.
       booleans(8) has details on booleans and setsebool(8) describes how
       booleans can now be set persistent across reboots.
       selinux_booleans_path(3) will return the active policy path to these
       files. The default boolean files are:
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/booleans
              /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/booleans.local
       Where {SELINUXTYPE} is the entry from the selinux configuration file
       config (see selinux_config(5)).
