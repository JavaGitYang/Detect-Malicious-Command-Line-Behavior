       Each line in /etc/subuid contains a user name and a range of
       subordinate user ids that user is allowed to use. This is specified
       with three fields delimited by colons (“:”). These fields are:
       ·   login name or UID
       ·   numerical subordinate user ID
       ·   numerical subordinate user ID count
       This file specifies the user IDs that ordinary users can use, with
       the newuidmap command, to configure uid mapping in a user namespace.
       Multiple ranges may be specified per user.
       When large number of entries (10000-100000 or more) are defined in
       /etc/subuid, parsing performance penalty will become noticeable. In
       this case it is recommended to use UIDs instead of login names.
       Benchmarks have shown speed-ups up to 20x.
