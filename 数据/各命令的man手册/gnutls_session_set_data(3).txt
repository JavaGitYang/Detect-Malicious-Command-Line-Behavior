       Sets all session parameters, in order to resume a previously
       established session.  The session data given must be the one returned
       by gnutls_session_get_data().  This function should be called before
       gnutls_handshake().
       Keep in mind that session resuming is advisory. The server may choose
       not to resume the session, thus a full handshake will be performed.
