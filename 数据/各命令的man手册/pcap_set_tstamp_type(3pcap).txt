       pcap_set_tstamp_type() sets the type of time stamp desired for
       packets captured on the pcap descriptor to the type specified by
       tstamp_type.  It must be called on a pcap descriptor created by
       pcap_create() that has not yet been activated by pcap_activate().
       pcap_list_tstamp_types() will give a list of the time stamp types
       supported by a given capture device.  See pcap-tstamp(7) for a list
       of all the time stamp types.
