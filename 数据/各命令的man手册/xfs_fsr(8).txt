       xfs_fsr is applicable only to XFS filesystems.
       xfs_fsr improves the organization of mounted filesystems.  The
       reorganization algorithm operates on one file at a time, compacting
       or otherwise improving the layout of the file extents (contiguous
       blocks of file data).
       The following options are accepted by xfs_fsr.  The -m, -t, and -f
       options have no meaning if any filesystems or files are specified on
       the command line.
       -m mtab      Use this file for the list of filesystems to reorganize.
                    The default is to use /etc/mtab.
       -t seconds   How long to reorganize.  The default is 7200 seconds (2
                    hours).
       -p passes    Number of passes before terminating global re-org.  The
                    default is 10 passes.
       -f leftoff   Use this file instead of /var/tmp/.fsrlast to read the
                    state of where to start and as the file to store the
                    state of where reorganization left off.
       -v           Verbose.  Print cryptic information about each file
                    being reorganized.
       -d           Debug.  Print even more cryptic information.
       -g           Print to syslog (default if stdout not a tty).
       -V           Prints the version number and exits.
       When invoked with no arguments xfs_fsr reorganizes all regular files
       in all mounted filesystems.  xfs_fsr makes many cycles over /etc/mtab
       each time making a single pass over each XFS filesystem.  Each pass
       goes through and selects files that have the largest number of
       extents.  It attempts to defragment the top 10% of these files on
       each pass.
       It runs for up to two hours after which it records the filesystem
       where it left off, so it can start there the next time.  This
       information is stored in the file /var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs.  If the
       information found here is somehow inconsistent or out of date it is
       ignored and reorganization starts at the beginning of the first
       filesystem found in /etc/mtab.
       xfs_fsr can be called with one or more arguments naming filesystems
       (block device name), and files to reorganize.  In this mode xfs_fsr
       does not read or write /var/tmp/.fsrlast_xfs nor does it run for a
       fixed time interval.  It makes one pass through each specified
       regular file and all regular files in each specified filesystem.  A
       command line name referring to a symbolic link (except to a file
       system device), FIFO, or UNIX domain socket generates a warning
       message, but is otherwise ignored.  While traversing the filesystem
       these types of files are silently skipped.
