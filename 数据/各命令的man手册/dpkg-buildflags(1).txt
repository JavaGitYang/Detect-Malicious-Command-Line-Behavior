       dpkg-buildflags is a tool to retrieve compilation flags to use during
       build of Debian packages.  The default flags are defined by the
       vendor but they can be extended/overridden in several ways:
       1.     system-wide with /usr/local/etc/dpkg/buildflags.conf;
       2.     for the current user with
              $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dpkg/buildflags.conf where $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
              defaults to $HOME/.config;
       3.     temporarily by the user with environment variables (see
              section ENVIRONMENT);
       4.     dynamically by the package maintainer with environment
              variables set via debian/rules (see section ENVIRONMENT).
       The configuration files can contain four types of directives:
       SET flag value
              Override the flag named flag to have the value value.
       STRIP flag value
              Strip from the flag named flag all the build flags listed in
              value.
       APPEND flag value
              Extend the flag named flag by appending the options given in
              value.  A space is prepended to the appended value if the
              flag's current value is non-empty.
       PREPEND flag value
              Extend the flag named flag by prepending the options given in
              value.  A space is appended to the prepended value if the
              flag's current value is non-empty.
       The configuration files can contain comments on lines starting with a
       hash (#). Empty lines are also ignored.
