       This function will read the certificate and return the appropriate
       digest algorithm to use for signing with this certificate. Some
       certificates (i.e.  DSA might not be able to sign without the
       preferred algorithm).
       To get the signature algorithm instead of just the hash use
       gnutls_pk_to_sign() with the algorithm of the certificate/key and the
       provided  hash .
