       pam_selinux is a PAM module that sets up the default SELinux security
       context for the next executed process.
       When a new session is started, the open_session part of the module
       computes and sets up the execution security context used for the next
       execve(2) call, the file security context for the controlling
       terminal, and the security context used for creating a new kernel
       keyring.
       When the session is ended, the close_session part of the module
       restores old security contexts that were in effect before the change
       made by the open_session part of the module.
       Adding pam_selinux into the PAM stack might disrupt behavior of other
       PAM modules which execute applications. To avoid that, pam_selinux.so
       open should be placed after such modules in the PAM stack, and
       pam_selinux.so close should be placed before them. When such a
       placement is not feasible, pam_selinux.so restore could be used to
       temporary restore original security contexts.
