       btrfs-image is used to create an image of a btrfs filesystem. All
       data will be zeroed, but metadata and the like is preserved. Mainly
       used for debugging purposes.
       In the dump mode, source is the btrfs device/file and target is the
       output file (use - for stdout).
       In the restore mode (option -r), source is the dumped image and
       target is the btrfs device/file.
