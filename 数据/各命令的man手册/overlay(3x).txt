   overlay, overwrite
       The overlay and overwrite routines overlay srcwin on top of dstwin.
       scrwin and dstwin are not required to be the same size; only text
       where the two windows overlap is copied.  The difference is that
       overlay is non-destructive (blanks are not copied) whereas overwrite
       is destructive.
   copywin
       The copywin routine provides a finer granularity of control over the
       overlay and overwrite routines.  As in the prefresh routine, a
       rectangle is specified in the destination window, (dminrow, dmincol)
       and (dmaxrow, dmaxcol), and the upper-left-corner coordinates of the
       source window, (sminrow, smincol).  If the argument overlay is true,
       then copying is non-destructive, as in overlay.
