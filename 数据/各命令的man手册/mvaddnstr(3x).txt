       These functions write the (null-terminated) character string str on
       the given window.  It is similar to calling waddch once for each
       character in the string.
       The mv functions perform cursor movement once, before writing any
       characters.  Thereafter, the cursor is advanced as a side-effect of
       writing to the window.
       The four functions with n as the last argument write at most n
       characters, or until a terminating null is reached.  If n is -1, then
       the entire string will be added.
