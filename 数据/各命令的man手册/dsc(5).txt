       Each Debian source package is composed of a .dsc control file, which
       contains a number of fields.  Each field begins with a tag, such as
       Source or Binary (case insensitive), followed by a colon, and the
       body of the field.  Fields are delimited only by field tags.  In
       other words, field text may be multiple lines in length, but the
       installation tools will generally join lines when processing the body
       of the field (except in case of the multiline fields Package-List,
       Files, Checksums-Sha1 and Checksums-Sha256, see below).
       The control data might be enclosed in an OpenPGP ASCII Armored
       signature, as specified in RFC4880.
