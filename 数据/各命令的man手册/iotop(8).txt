       iotop watches I/O usage information output by the Linux kernel
       (requires 2.6.20 or later) and displays a table of current I/O usage
       by processes or threads on the system. At least the
       CONFIG_TASK_DELAY_ACCT, CONFIG_TASK_IO_ACCOUNTING, CONFIG_TASKSTATS
       and CONFIG_VM_EVENT_COUNTERS options need to be enabled in your Linux
       kernel build configuration.
       iotop displays columns for the I/O bandwidth read and written by each
       process/thread during the sampling period. It also displays the
       percentage of time the thread/process spent while swapping in and
       while waiting on I/O. For each process, its I/O priority
       (class/level) is shown.
       In addition, the total I/O bandwidth read and written during the
       sampling period is displayed at the top of the interface.  Total DISK
       READ and Total DISK WRITE values represent total read and write
       bandwidth between processes and kernel threads on the one side and
       kernel block device subsystem on the other. While Current DISK READ
       and Current DISK WRITE values represent corresponding bandwidths for
       current disk I/O between kernel block device subsystem and underlying
       hardware (HDD, SSD, etc.).  Thus Total and Current values may not be
       equal at any given moment of time due to data caching and I/O
       operations reordering that take place inside Linux kernel.
       Use the left and right arrows to change the sorting, r to reverse the
       sorting order, o to toggle the --only option, p to toggle the
       --processes option, a to toggle the --accumulated option, q to quit
       or i to change the priority of a thread or a process' thread(s). Any
       other key will force a refresh.
