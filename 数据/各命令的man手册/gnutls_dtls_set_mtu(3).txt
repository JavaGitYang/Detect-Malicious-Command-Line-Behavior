       This function will set the maximum transfer unit of the transport
       that DTLS packets are sent over. Note that this should exclude the IP
       (or IPv6) and UDP headers. So for DTLS over IPv6 on an Ethernet
       device with MTU 1500, the DTLS MTU set with this function would be
       1500 - 40 (IPV6 header) - 8 (UDP header) = 1452.
