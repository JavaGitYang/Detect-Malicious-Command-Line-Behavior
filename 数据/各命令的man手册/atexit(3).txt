       The atexit() function registers the given function to be called at
       normal process termination, either via exit(3) or via return from the
       program's main().  Functions so registered are called in the reverse
       order of their registration; no arguments are passed.
       The same function may be registered multiple times: it is called once
       for each registration.
       POSIX.1 requires that an implementation allow at least ATEXIT_MAX
       (32) such functions to be registered.  The actual limit supported by
       an implementation can be obtained using sysconf(3).
       When a child process is created via fork(2), it inherits copies of
       its parent's registrations.  Upon a successful call to one of the
       exec(3) functions, all registrations are removed.
