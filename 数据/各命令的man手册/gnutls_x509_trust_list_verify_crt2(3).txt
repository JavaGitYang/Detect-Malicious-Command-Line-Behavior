       This function will attempt to verify the given certificate chain and
       return its status. The  voutput parameter will hold an OR'ed sequence
       of gnutls_certificate_status_t flags.
       When a certificate chain of  cert_list_size with more than one
       certificates is provided, the verification status will apply to the
       first certificate in the chain that failed verification. The
       verification process starts from the end of the chain (from CA to end
       certificate). The first certificate in the chain must be the
       end-certificate while the rest of the members may be sorted or not.
       Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified from
       the ones in gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t by ORing the
       result of GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS() to the verification flags.
       Additional verification parameters are possible via the  data types;
       the acceptable types are GNUTLS_DT_DNS_HOSTNAME, GNUTLS_DT_IP_ADDRESS
       and GNUTLS_DT_KEY_PURPOSE_OID.  The former accepts as data a
       null-terminated hostname, and the latter a null-terminated object
       identifier (e.g., GNUTLS_KP_TLS_WWW_SERVER).  If a DNS hostname is
       provided then this function will compare the hostname in the end
       certificate against the given. If names do not match the
       GNUTLS_CERT_UNEXPECTED_OWNER status flag will be set. In addition it
       will consider certificates provided with
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt().
       If a key purpose OID is provided and the end-certificate contains the
       extended key usage PKIX extension, it will be required to match the
       provided OID or be marked for any purpose, otherwise verification
       will fail with GNUTLS_CERT_PURPOSE_MISMATCH status.
