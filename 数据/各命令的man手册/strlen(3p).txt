       The strlen() function shall compute the number of bytes in the string
       to which s points, not including the terminating NUL character.
       The strnlen() function shall compute the smaller of the number of
       bytes in the array to which s points, not including the terminating
       NUL character, or the value of the maxlen argument. The strnlen()
       function shall never examine more than maxlen bytes of the array
       pointed to by s.
