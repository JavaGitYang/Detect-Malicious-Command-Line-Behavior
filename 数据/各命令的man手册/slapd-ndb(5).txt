       The ndb backend to slapd(8) uses the MySQL Cluster package to store
       data, through its NDB API.  It provides fault tolerance with extreme
       scalability, along with a degree of SQL compatibility.
       This backend is designed to store LDAP information using tables that
       are also visible from SQL. It uses a higher level SQL API for
       creating these tables, while using the low level NDB API for storing
       and retrieving the data within these tables. The NDB Cluster engine
       allows data to be partitioned across multiple data nodes, and this
       backend allows multiple slapd instances to operate against a given
       database concurrently.
       The general approach is to use distinct tables for each LDAP object
       class.  Entries comprised of multiple object classes will have their
       data spread across multiple tables. The data tables use a 64 bit
       entryID as their primary key. The DIT hierarchy is maintained in a
       separate table, which maps DNs to entryIDs.
       This backend is experimental. While intended to be a general-purpose
       backend, it is currently missing a number of common LDAP features.
       See the TODO file in the source directory for details.
