       This function will return the certificate with the given DN, if it is
       stored in the token. By default only marked as trusted issuers are
       retuned. If any issuer should be returned specify
       GNUTLS_PKCS11_OBJ_FLAG_RETRIEVE_ANY in  flags .
       The name of the function includes issuer because it can be used to
       discover issuers of certificates.
