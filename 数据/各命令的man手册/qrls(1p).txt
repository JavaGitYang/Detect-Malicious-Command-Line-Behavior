       A batch job might have one or more holds, which prevent the batch job
       from executing. A batch job from which all the holds have been
       removed becomes eligible for execution and is said to have been
       released. A batch job hold is removed by sending a request to the
       batch server that manages the batch job. The qrls utility is a user-
       accessible client of batch services that requests holds be removed
       from one or more batch jobs.
       The qrls utility shall remove one or more holds from those batch jobs
       for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the utility.
       The qrls utility shall remove holds from batch jobs in the order in
       which their batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.
       If the qrls utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
       successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
       batch job_identifiers, if any.
       The qrls utility shall remove holds on each batch job by sending a
       Release Job Request to the batch server that manages the batch job.
       The qrls utility shall not exit until the holds have been removed
       from the batch job corresponding to each successfully processed batch
       job_identifier.
