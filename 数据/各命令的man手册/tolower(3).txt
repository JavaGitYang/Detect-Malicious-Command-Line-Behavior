       These functions convert lowercase letters to uppercase, and vice
       versa.
       If c is a lowercase letter, toupper() returns its uppercase
       equivalent, if an uppercase representation exists in the current
       locale.  Otherwise, it returns c.  The toupper_l() function performs
       the same task, but uses the locale referred to by the locale handle
       locale.
       If c is an uppercase letter, tolower() returns its lowercase
       equivalent, if a lowercase representation exists in the current
       locale.  Otherwise, it returns c.  The tolower_l() function performs
       the same task, but uses the locale referred to by the locale handle
       locale.
       If c is neither an unsigned char value nor EOF, the behavior of these
       functions is undefined.
       The behavior of toupper_l() and tolower_l() is undefined if locale is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE (see duplocale(3)) or is
       not a valid locale object handle.
