       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The fwide() function shall determine the orientation of the stream
       pointed to by stream.  If mode is greater than zero, the function
       first attempts to make the stream wide-oriented. If mode is less than
       zero, the function first attempts to make the stream byte-oriented.
       Otherwise, mode is zero and the function does not alter the
       orientation of the stream.
       If the orientation of the stream has already been determined, fwide()
       shall not change it.
       The fwide() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call fwide(), then check errno, and if it is non-zero, assume
       an error has occurred.
