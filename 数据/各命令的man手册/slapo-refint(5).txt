       The Referential Integrity overlay can be used with a backend database
       such as slapd-bdb(5) to maintain the cohesiveness of a schema which
       utilizes reference attributes.
       Integrity is maintained by updating database records which contain
       the named attributes to match the results of a modrdn or delete
       operation. For example, if the integrity attribute were configured as
       manager, deletion of the record
       "uid=robert,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would trigger a search for
       all other records which have a manager attribute containing that DN.
       Entries matching that search would have their manager attribute
       removed.  Or, renaming the same record into
       "uid=george,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com" would trigger a search for
       all other records which have a manager attribute containing that DN.
       Entries matching that search would have their manager attribute
       deleted and replaced by the new DN.
       rootdn must be set for the database.  refint runs as the rootdn to
       gain access to make its updates.  rootpw is not needed.
