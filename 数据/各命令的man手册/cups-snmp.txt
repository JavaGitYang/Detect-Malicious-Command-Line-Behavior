       The snmp.conf file configures how the standard CUPS network backends
       (http, https, ipp, ipps, lpd, snmp, and socket) access printer
       information using SNMPv1 and is normally located in the /etc/cups
       directory.  Each line in the file can be a configuration directive, a
       blank line, or a comment. Comment lines start with the # character.
       The Community and DebugLevel directives are used by all backends. The
       remainder apply only to the SNMP backend - cups-snmp(8).
