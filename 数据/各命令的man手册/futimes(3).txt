       futimes() changes the access and modification times of a file in the
       same way as utimes(2), with the difference that the file whose
       timestamps are to be changed is specified via a file descriptor, fd,
       rather than via a pathname.
       lutimes() changes the access and modification times of a file in the
       same way as utimes(2), with the difference that if filename refers to
       a symbolic link, then the link is not dereferenced: instead, the
       timestamps of the symbolic link are changed.
