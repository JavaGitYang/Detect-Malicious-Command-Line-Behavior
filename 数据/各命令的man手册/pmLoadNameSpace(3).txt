       If the application wants to force using a local Performance Metrics
       Name Space (PMNS) instead of a distributed PMNS then it must load the
       PMNS using pmLoadNameSpace or pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3).  If the
       application is to use a distributed PMNS, then it should NOT make a
       call to load the PMNS explicitly.
       Most applications using a Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) context (of any type, so PM_CONTEXT_HOST or
       PM_CONTEXT_ARCHIVE or PM_CONTEXT_LOCAL) should not need to call
       pmLoadNameSpace.
       The filename argument designates the PMNS of interest.  For
       applications not requiring a tailored PMNS, the special value
       PM_NS_DEFAULT may be used for filename, to force the default local
       PMNS to be loaded.
       The default local PMNS is found in the file $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/root
       unless the environment variable PMNS_DEFAULT is set, in which case
       the value is assumed to be the pathname to the file containing the
       default local PMNS.
       Externally a PMNS is stored in an ASCII format as described in
       pmns(5).  However, note that pmLoadNameSpace assumes filename does
       not contain any C-style comments, pre-processor directives or macros;
       if this is not the case, pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) should be used
       instead.
       As of Version 3.10.3 of PCP, by default, multiple names in the PMNS
       are allowed to be associated with a single Performance Metrics
       Identifier (PMID) and this is unconditionally allowed by
       pmLoadNameSpace.  pmLoadASCIINameSpace(3) provides an alternative
       interface with user-defined control over the handling of duplicate
       names for the same PMID in the PMNS.
       pmLoadNameSpace returns zero on success.
