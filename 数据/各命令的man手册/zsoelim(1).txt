       zsoelim parses file arguments, or if none are specified, its standard
       input for lines of the form:
       .so <filename>
       These requests are replaced by the contents of the filename
       specified.  If the request cannot be met, zsoelim looks for
       filename.ext where .ext can be one of .gz, .Z or .z.  Other extension
       types may be supported depending upon compile time options.  If the
       request can be met by a compressed file, this file is decompressed
       using an appropriate decompressor and its output is used to satisfy
       the request.
       Traditionally, soelim programs were used to allow roff preprocessors
       to be able to preprocess the files referred to by the requests.  This
       particular version was written to circumvent problems created by
       support for compressed manual pages.
