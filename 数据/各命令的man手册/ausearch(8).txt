       ausearch is a tool that can query the audit daemon logs based for
       events based on different search criteria. The ausearch utility can
       also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data.
       Each commandline option given forms an "and" statement. For example,
       searching with -m and -ui means return events that have both the
       requested type and match the user id given. An exception is the -m
       and -n options; multiple record types and nodes are allowed in a
       search which will return any matching node and record.
       It should also be noted that each syscall excursion from user space
       into the kernel and back into user space has one event ID that is
       unique. Any auditable event that is triggered during this trip share
       this ID so that they may be correlated.
       Different parts of the kernel may add supplemental records. For
       example, an audit event on the syscall "open" will also cause the
       kernel to emit a PATH record with the file name. The ausearch utility
       will present all records that make up one event together. This could
       mean that even though you search for a specific kind of record, the
       resulting events may contain SYSCALL records.
       Also be aware that not all record types have the requested
       information. For example, a PATH record does not have a hostname or a
       loginuid.
