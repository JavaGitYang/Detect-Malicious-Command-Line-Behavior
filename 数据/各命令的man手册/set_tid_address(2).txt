       For each thread, the kernel maintains two attributes (addresses)
       called set_child_tid and clear_child_tid.  These two attributes
       contain the value NULL by default.
       set_child_tid
              If a thread is started using clone(2) with the
              CLONE_CHILD_SETTID flag, set_child_tid is set to the value
              passed in the ctid argument of that system call.
              When set_child_tid is set, the very first thing the new thread
              does is to write its thread ID at this address.
       clear_child_tid
              If a thread is started using clone(2) with the
              CLONE_CHILD_CLEARTID flag, clear_child_tid is set to the value
              passed in the ctid argument of that system call.
       The system call set_tid_address() sets the clear_child_tid value for
       the calling thread to tidptr.
       When a thread whose clear_child_tid is not NULL terminates, then, if
       the thread is sharing memory with other threads, then 0 is written at
       the address specified in clear_child_tid and the kernel performs the
       following operation:
           futex(clear_child_tid, FUTEX_WAKE, 1, NULL, NULL, 0);
       The effect of this operation is to wake a single thread that is
       performing a futex wait on the memory location.  Errors from the
       futex wake operation are ignored.
