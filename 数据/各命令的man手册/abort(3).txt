       The abort() first unblocks the SIGABRT signal, and then raises that
       signal for the calling process (as though raise(3) was called).  This
       results in the abnormal termination of the process unless the SIGABRT
       signal is caught and the signal handler does not return (see
       longjmp(3)).
       If the SIGABRT signal is ignored, or caught by a handler that
       returns, the abort() function will still terminate the process.  It
       does this by restoring the default disposition for SIGABRT and then
       raising the signal for a second time.
