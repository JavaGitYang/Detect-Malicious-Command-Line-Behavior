       If the terminal is using asynchronous serial data transmission,
       tcsendbreak() shall cause transmission of a continuous stream of
       zero-valued bits for a specific duration. If duration is 0, it shall
       cause transmission of zero-valued bits for at least 0.25 seconds, and
       not more than 0.5 seconds. If duration is not 0, it shall send zero-
       valued bits for an implementation-defined period of time.
       The fildes argument is an open file descriptor associated with a
       terminal.
       If the terminal is not using asynchronous serial data transmission,
       it is implementation-defined whether tcsendbreak() sends data to
       generate a break condition or returns without taking any action.
       Attempts to use tcsendbreak() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
       ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
       operation, and no signal is sent.
