       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The atexit() function shall register the function pointed to by func,
       to be called without arguments at normal program termination. At
       normal program termination, all functions registered by the atexit()
       function shall be called, in the reverse order of their registration,
       except that a function is called after any previously registered
       functions that had already been called at the time it was registered.
       Normal termination occurs either by a call to exit() or a return from
       main().
       At least 32 functions can be registered with atexit().
       After a successful call to any of the exec functions, any functions
       previously registered by atexit() shall no longer be registered.
