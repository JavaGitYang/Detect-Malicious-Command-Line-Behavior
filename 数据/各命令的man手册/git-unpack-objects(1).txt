       Read a packed archive (.pack) from the standard input, expanding the
       objects contained within and writing them into the repository in
       "loose" (one object per file) format.
       Objects that already exist in the repository will not be unpacked
       from the packfile. Therefore, nothing will be unpacked if you use
       this command on a packfile that exists within the target repository.
       See git-repack(1) for options to generate new packs and replace
       existing ones.
