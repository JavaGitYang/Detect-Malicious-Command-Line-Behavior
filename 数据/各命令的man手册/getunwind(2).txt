       Note: this function is obsolete.
       The IA-64-specific getunwind() system call copies the kernel's call
       frame unwind data into the buffer pointed to by buf and returns the
       size of the unwind data; this data describes the gate page (kernel
       code that is mapped into user space).
       The size of the buffer buf is specified in buf_size.  The data is
       copied only if buf_size is greater than or equal to the size of the
       unwind data and buf is not NULL; otherwise, no data is copied, and
       the call succeeds, returning the size that would be needed to store
       the unwind data.
       The first part of the unwind data contains an unwind table.  The rest
       contains the associated unwind information, in no particular order.
       The unwind table contains entries of the following form:
           u64 start;      (64-bit address of start of function)
           u64 end;        (64-bit address of end of function)
           u64 info;       (BUF-relative offset to unwind info)
       An entry whose start value is zero indicates the end of the table.
       For more information about the format, see the IA-64 Software Conven‚Äê
       tions and Runtime Architecture manual.
