       The pam_sm_chauthtok function is the service module's implementation
       of the pam_chauthtok(3) interface.
       This function is used to (re-)set the authentication token of the
       user.
       Valid flags, which may be logically OR'd with PAM_SILENT, are:
       PAM_SILENT
           Do not emit any messages.
       PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK
           This argument indicates to the module that the user's
           authentication token (password) should only be changed if it has
           expired. This flag is optional and must be combined with one of
           the following two flags. Note, however, the following two options
           are mutually exclusive.
       PAM_PRELIM_CHECK
           This indicates that the modules are being probed as to their
           ready status for altering the user's authentication token. If the
           module requires access to another system over some network it
           should attempt to verify it can connect to this system on
           receiving this flag. If a module cannot establish it is ready to
           update the user's authentication token it should return
           PAM_TRY_AGAIN, this information will be passed back to the
           application.
           If the control value sufficient is used in the password stack,
           the PAM_PRELIM_CHECK section of the modules following that
           control value is not always executed.
       PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK
           This informs the module that this is the call it should change
           the authorization tokens. If the flag is logically OR'd with
           PAM_CHANGE_EXPIRED_AUTHTOK, the token is only changed if it has
           actually expired.
       The PAM library calls this function twice in succession. The first
       time with PAM_PRELIM_CHECK and then, if the module does not return
       PAM_TRY_AGAIN, subsequently with PAM_UPDATE_AUTHTOK. It is only on
       the second call that the authorization token is (possibly) changed.
