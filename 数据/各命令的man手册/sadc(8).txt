       The sadc command samples system data a specified number of times
       (count) at a specified interval measured in seconds (interval). It
       writes in binary format to the specified outfile or to standard
       output. If outfile is set to -, then sadc uses the standard system
       activity daily data file (see below).  In this case, if the file
       already exists, sadc will overwrite it if it is from a previous
       month.  By default sadc collects most of the data available from the
       kernel.  But there are also optional metrics, for which the relevant
       options must be explicitly passed to sadc to be collected (see option
       -S below).
       The standard system activity daily data file is named saDD unless
       option -D is used, in which case its name is saYYYYMMDD, where YYYY
       stands for the current year, MM for the current month and DD for the
       current day.  By default it is located in the /var/log/sa directory.
       Yet it is possible to specify an alternate location for it: If
       outfile is a directory (instead of a plain file) then it will be
       considered as the directory where the standard system activity daily
       data file will be saved.
       When the count parameter is not specified, sadc writes its data
       endlessly.  When both interval and count are not specified, and
       option -C is not used, a dummy record, which is used at system
       startup to mark the time when the counter restarts from 0, will be
       written.  For example, one of the system startup script may write the
       restart mark to the daily data file by the command entry:
       /usr/local/lib64/sa/sadc -
       The sadc command is intended to be used as a backend to the sar
       command.
       Note: The sadc command only reports on local activities.
