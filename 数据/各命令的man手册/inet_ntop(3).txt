       This function converts the network address structure src in the af
       address family into a character string.  The resulting string is
       copied to the buffer pointed to by dst, which must be a non-null
       pointer.  The caller specifies the number of bytes available in this
       buffer in the argument size.
       inet_ntop() extends the inet_ntoa(3) function to support multiple
       address families, inet_ntoa(3) is now considered to be deprecated in
       favor of inet_ntop().  The following address families are currently
       supported:
       AF_INET
              src points to a struct in_addr (in network byte order) which
              is converted to an IPv4 network address in the dotted-decimal
              format, "ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd".  The buffer dst must be at least
              INET_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.
       AF_INET6
              src points to a struct in6_addr (in network byte order) which
              is converted to a representation of this address in the most
              appropriate IPv6 network address format for this address.  The
              buffer dst must be at least INET6_ADDRSTRLEN bytes long.
