       If the tty service has been configured and is available for the
       container specified as parameter, this command will launch a console
       allowing to log on the container.
       The available tty are free slots taken by this command. That means if
       the container has four ttys available and the command has been
       launched four times each taking a different tty, the fifth command
       will fail because no console will be available.
       The command will connect to a tty. If the connection is lost or
       broken, the command can be launched again and regain the tty at the
       state it was before the disconnection.
       A ttynum of 0 may be given to attach to the container's /dev/console
       instead of its dev/tty<ttynum>.
       A keyboard escape sequence may be used to disconnect from the tty and
       quit lxc-console. The default escape sequence is <Ctrl+a q>.
