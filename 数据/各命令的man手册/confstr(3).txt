       confstr() gets the value of configuration-dependent string variables.
       The name argument is the system variable to be queried.  The
       following variables are supported:
       _CS_GNU_LIBC_VERSION (GNU C library only; since glibc 2.3.2)
              A string which identifies the GNU C library version on this
              system (e.g., "glibc 2.3.4").
       _CS_GNU_LIBPTHREAD_VERSION (GNU C library only; since glibc 2.3.2)
              A string which identifies the POSIX implementation supplied by
              this C library (e.g., "NPTL 2.3.4" or "linuxthreads-0.10").
       _CS_PATH
              A value for the PATH variable which indicates where all the
              POSIX.2 standard utilities can be found.
       If buf is not NULL and len is not zero, confstr() copies the value of
       the string to buf truncated to len - 1 bytes if necessary, with a
       null byte ('\0') as terminator.  This can be detected by comparing
       the return value of confstr() against len.
       If len is zero and buf is NULL, confstr() just returns the value as
       defined below.
