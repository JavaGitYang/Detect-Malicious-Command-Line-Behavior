       These routines delete the character under the cursor; all characters
       to the right of the cursor on the same line are moved to the left one
       position and the last character on the line is filled with a blank.
       The cursor position does not change (after moving to y, x, if
       specified).  (This does not imply use of the hardware delete
       character feature.)
