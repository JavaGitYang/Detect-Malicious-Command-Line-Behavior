       For wcscpy(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcpcpy() and wcscpy() functions shall copy the wide-character
       string pointed to by ws2 (including the terminating null wide-
       character code) into the array pointed to by ws1.
       The application shall ensure that there is room for at least
       wcslen(ws2)+1 wide characters in the ws1 array, and that the ws2 and
       ws1 arrays do not overlap.
       If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the behavior is
       undefined.
