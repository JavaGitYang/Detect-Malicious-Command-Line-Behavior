       The strcasecmp() function performs a byte-by-byte comparison of the
       strings s1 and s2, ignoring the case of the characters.  It returns
       an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is found,
       respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than s2.
       The strncasecmp() function is similar, except that it compares no
       more than n bytes of s1 and s2.
