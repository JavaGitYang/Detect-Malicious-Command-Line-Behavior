       The pam_getenvlist function returns a complete copy of the PAM
       environment as associated with the handle pamh. The PAM environment
       variables represent the contents of the regular environment variables
       of the authenticated user when service is granted.
       The format of the memory is a malloc()'d array of char pointers, the
       last element of which is set to NULL. Each of the non-NULL entries in
       this array point to a NUL terminated and malloc()'d char string of
       the form: "name=value".
       It should be noted that this memory will never be free()'d by libpam.
       Once obtained by a call to pam_getenvlist, it is the responsibility
       of the calling application to free() this memory.
       It is by design, and not a coincidence, that the format and contents
       of the returned array matches that required for the third argument of
       the execle(3) function call.
