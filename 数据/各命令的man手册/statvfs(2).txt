       The function statvfs() returns information about a mounted
       filesystem.  path is the pathname of any file within the mounted
       filesystem.  buf is a pointer to a statvfs structure defined
       approximately as follows:
           struct statvfs {
               unsigned long  f_bsize;    /* Filesystem block size */
               unsigned long  f_frsize;   /* Fragment size */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_blocks;   /* Size of fs in f_frsize units */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_bfree;    /* Number of free blocks */
               fsblkcnt_t     f_bavail;   /* Number of free blocks for
                                             unprivileged users */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_files;    /* Number of inodes */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_ffree;    /* Number of free inodes */
               fsfilcnt_t     f_favail;   /* Number of free inodes for
                                             unprivileged users */
               unsigned long  f_fsid;     /* Filesystem ID */
               unsigned long  f_flag;     /* Mount flags */
               unsigned long  f_namemax;  /* Maximum filename length */
           };
       Here the types fsblkcnt_t and fsfilcnt_t are defined in
       <sys/types.h>.  Both used to be unsigned long.
       The field f_flag is a bit mask indicating various options that were
       employed when mounting this filesystem.  It contains zero or more of
       the following flags:
       ST_MANDLOCK
              Mandatory locking is permitted on the filesystem (see
              fcntl(2)).
       ST_NOATIME
              Do not update access times; see mount(2).
       ST_NODEV
              Disallow access to device special files on this filesystem.
       ST_NODIRATIME
              Do not update directory access times; see mount(2).
       ST_NOEXEC
              Execution of programs is disallowed on this filesystem.
       ST_NOSUID
              The set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits are ignored by exec(3)
              for executable files on this filesystem
       ST_RDONLY
              This filesystem is mounted read-only.
       ST_RELATIME
              Update atime relative to mtime/ctime; see mount(2).
       ST_SYNCHRONOUS
              Writes are synched to the filesystem immediately (see the
              description of O_SYNC in open(2)).
       It is unspecified whether all members of the returned struct have
       meaningful values on all filesystems.
       fstatvfs() returns the same information about an open file referenced
       by descriptor fd.
