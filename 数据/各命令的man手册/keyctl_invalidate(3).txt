       keyctl_invalidate() invalidates a key.  The key is scheduled for
       immediate removal from all the keyrings that point to it, after which
       it will be deleted.  The key will be ignored by all searches once
       this function is called even if it is not yet fully dealt with.
       The caller must have search permission on a key to be able to
       invalidate it.
