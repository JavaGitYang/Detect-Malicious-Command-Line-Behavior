       The iswupper() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isupper(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "upper".
       The wide-character class "upper" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alpha", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "alnum", of the wide-character class "graph" and of the wide-
       character class "print".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
       character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alnum", the wide-
       character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "punct".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "alpha", the wide-
       character class "upper" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "digit".
       The wide-character class "upper" contains at least those characters
       wc which are equal to towupper(wc) and different from towlower(wc).
       The wide-character class "upper" always contains at least the letters
       'A' to 'Z'.
