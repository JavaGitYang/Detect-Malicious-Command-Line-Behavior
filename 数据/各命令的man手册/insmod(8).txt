       insmod is a trivial program to insert a module into the kernel. Most
       users will want to use modprobe(8) instead, which is more clever and
       can handle module dependencies.
       Only the most general of error messages are reported: as the work of
       trying to link the module is now done inside the kernel, the dmesg
       usually gives more information about errors.
