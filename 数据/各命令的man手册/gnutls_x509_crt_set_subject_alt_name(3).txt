       This function will set the subject alternative name certificate
       extension. It can set the following types: GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME as a
       text string, GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME as a text string, GNUTLS_SAN_URI
       as a text string, GNUTLS_SAN_IPADDRESS as a binary IP address (4 or
       16 bytes), GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP as a UTF8 string (since 3.5.0).
       Since version 3.5.7 the GNUTLS_SAN_RFC822NAME, GNUTLS_SAN_DNSNAME,
       and GNUTLS_SAN_OTHERNAME_XMPP are converted to ACE format when
       necessary.
