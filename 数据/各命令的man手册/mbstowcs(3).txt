       If dest is not NULL, the mbstowcs() function converts the multibyte
       string src to a wide-character string starting at dest.  At most n
       wide characters are written to dest.  The sequence of characters in
       the string src shall begin in the initial shift state.  The
       conversion can stop for three reasons:
       1. An invalid multibyte sequence has been encountered.  In this case,
          (size_t) -1 is returned.
       2. n non-L'\0' wide characters have been stored at dest.  In this
          case, the number of wide characters written to dest is returned,
          but the shift state at this point is lost.
       3. The multibyte string has been completely converted, including the
          terminating null character ('\0').  In this case, the number of
          wide characters written to dest, excluding the terminating null
          wide character, is returned.
       The programmer must ensure that there is room for at least n wide
       characters at dest.
       If dest is NULL, n is ignored, and the conversion proceeds as above,
       except that the converted wide characters are not written out to
       memory, and that no length limit exists.
       In order to avoid the case 2 above, the programmer should make sure n
       is greater than or equal to mbstowcs(NULL,src,0)+1.
