       The dlerror() function returns a human-readable, null-terminated
       string describing the most recent error that occurred from a call to
       one of the functions in the dlopen API since the last call to
       dlerror().  The returned string does not include a trailing newline.
       dlerror() returns NULL if no errors have occurred since
       initialization or since it was last called.
