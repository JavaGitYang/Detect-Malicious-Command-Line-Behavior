       A QmcIndom object represents a PMAPI(3) instance domain.  This
       includes a description of all the instances in the instance domain.
       A QmcInstance is a structure used to describe each instance in the
       instance domain.  This includes:
          - internal identifier. If this is less than zero, the instance is
          treated as a NULL entry in the instance table.
          - external name
          - reference count, ie. the number of QmcMetric objects referring
          to this instance.
          - the likely position of the instance in the pmResult from a
          pmFetch(3).  This is also used to indicate the position of the
          next NULL instance in the instance table, if this entry is also
          NULL.
          - a flag indicating if the instance was in the last pmGetInDom(3).
       The QmcIndom object has a list of QmcInstance structures, and various
       flags and counters to support dynamic instance domains where
       instances may come and go with each fetch and efficient profile
       generation.
