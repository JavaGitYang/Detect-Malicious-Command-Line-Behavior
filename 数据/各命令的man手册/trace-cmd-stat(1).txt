       The trace-cmd(1) stat displays the various status of the tracing
       (ftrace) system. The status that it shows is:
       Tracer: if one of the tracers (like function_graph) is active.
       Otherwise nothing is displayed.
       Events: Lists the events that are enable.
       Event filters: Shows any filters that are set for any events
       Function filters: Shows any filters for the function tracers
       Graph functions: Shows any functions that the function graph tracer
       should graph
       Buffers: Shows the trace buffer size if they have been expanded. By
       default, tracing buffers are in a compressed format until they are
       used. If they are compressed, the buffer display will not be shown.
       Trace clock: If the tracing clock is anything other than the default
       "local" it will be displayed.
       Trace CPU mask: If not all available CPUs are in the tracing CPU
       mask, then the tracing CPU mask will be displayed.
       Trace max latency: Shows the value of the trace max latency if it is
       other than zero.
       Kprobes: Shows any kprobes that are defined for tracing.
       Uprobes: Shows any uprobes that are defined for tracing.
