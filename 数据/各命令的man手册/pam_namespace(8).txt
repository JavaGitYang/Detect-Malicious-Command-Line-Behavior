       The pam_namespace PAM module sets up a private namespace for a
       session with polyinstantiated directories. A polyinstantiated
       directory provides a different instance of itself based on user name,
       or when using SELinux, user name, security context or both. If an
       executable script /etc/security/namespace.init exists, it is used to
       initialize the instance directory after it is set up and mounted on
       the polyinstantiated directory. The script receives the
       polyinstantiated directory path, the instance directory path, flag
       whether the instance directory was newly created (0 for no, 1 for
       yes), and the user name as its arguments.
       The pam_namespace module disassociates the session namespace from the
       parent namespace. Any mounts/unmounts performed in the parent
       namespace, such as mounting of devices, are not reflected in the
       session namespace. To propagate selected mount/unmount events from
       the parent namespace into the disassociated session namespace, an
       administrator may use the special shared-subtree feature. For
       additional information on shared-subtree feature, please refer to the
       mount(8) man page and the shared-subtree description at
       http://lwn.net/Articles/159077 and http://lwn.net/Articles/159092.
