       The pthread_attr_setaffinity_np() function sets the CPU affinity mask
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in cpuset.  This attribute determines the CPU
       affinity mask of a thread created using the thread attributes object
       attr.
       The pthread_attr_getaffinity_np() function returns the CPU affinity
       mask attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in
       the buffer pointed to by cpuset.
       The argument cpusetsize is the length (in bytes) of the buffer
       pointed to by cpuset.  Typically, this argument would be specified as
       sizeof(cpu_set_t).
       For more details on CPU affinity masks, see sched_setaffinity(2).
       For a description of a set of macros that can be used to manipulate
       and inspect CPU sets, see CPU_SET(3).
