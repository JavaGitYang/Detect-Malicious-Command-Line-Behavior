       The media contexts backend maps from media device names such as
       "cdrom" or "floppy" into security contexts. It is used to find the
       appropriate context for establishing context mounts on these devices.
       The returned context must be freed using freecon(3).
       selabel_lookup(3) describes the function with its return and error
       codes.
       The integer lookup argument is currently unused and should be set to
       zero.
       Any messages generated by selabel_lookup(3) are sent to stderr by
       default, although this can be changed by selinux_set_callback(3).
       selabel_lookup_raw(3) behaves identically to selabel_lookup(3) but
       does not perform context translation.
       The FILES section details the configuration files used to determine
       the media context.
