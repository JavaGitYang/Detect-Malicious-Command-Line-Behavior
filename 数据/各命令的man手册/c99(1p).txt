       The c99 utility is an interface to the standard C compilation system;
       it shall accept source code conforming to the ISO C standard. The
       system conceptually consists of a compiler and link editor. The input
       files referenced by pathname operands and −l option-arguments shall
       be compiled and linked to produce an executable file. (It is
       unspecified whether the linking occurs entirely within the operation
       of c99; some implementations may produce objects that are not fully
       resolved until the file is executed.)
       If the −c option is specified, for all pathname operands of the form
       file.c, the files:
           $(basename pathname .c).o
       shall be created as the result of successful compilation. If the −c
       option is not specified, it is unspecified whether such .o files are
       created or deleted for the file.c operands.
       If there are no options that prevent link editing (such as −c or −E),
       and all input files compile and link without error, the resulting
       executable file shall be written according to the −o outfile option
       (if present) or to the file a.out.
       The executable file shall be created as specified in Section 1.1.1.4,
       File Read, Write, and Creation, except that the file permission bits
       shall be set to: S_IRWXO | S_IRWXG | S_IRWXU
       and the bits specified by the umask of the process shall be cleared.
