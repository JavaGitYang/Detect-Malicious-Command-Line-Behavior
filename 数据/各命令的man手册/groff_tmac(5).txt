       The roff(7) type-setting system provides a set of macro packages
       suitable for special kinds of documents.  Each macro package stores
       its macros and definitions in a file called the package's tmac file.
       The name is deduced from ‘TroffMACros’.
       The tmac files are normal roff source documents, except that they
       usually contain only definitions and setup commands, but no text.
       All tmac files are kept in a single or a small number of directories,
       the tmac directories.
