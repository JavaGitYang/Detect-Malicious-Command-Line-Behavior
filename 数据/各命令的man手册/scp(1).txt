     scp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data
     transfer, and uses the same authentication and provides the same secu‐
     rity as ssh(1).  scp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are
     needed for authentication.
     The source and target may be specified as a local pathname, a remote
     host with optional path in the form [user@]host:[path], or a URI in the
     form scp://[user@]host[:port][/path].  Local file names can be made
     explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid scp treating
     file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.
     When copying between two remote hosts, if the URI format is used, a
     port may only be specified on the target if the -3 option is used.
     The options are as follows:
     -3      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the
             local host.  Without this option the data is copied directly
             between the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables
             the progress meter.
     -4      Forces scp to use IPv4 addresses only.
     -6      Forces scp to use IPv6 addresses only.
     -B      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or
             passphrases).
     -C      Compression enable.  Passes the -C flag to ssh(1) to enable
             compression.
     -c cipher
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).
     -F ssh_config
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for ssh.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).
     -i identity_file
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for pub‐
             lic key authentication is read.  This option is directly passed
             to ssh(1).
     -l limit
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.
     -o ssh_option
             Can be used to pass options to ssh in the format used in
             ssh_config(5).  This is useful for specifying options for which
             there is no separate scp command-line flag.  For full details
             of the options listed below, and their possible values, see
             ssh_config(5).

     -P port
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that
             this option is written with a capital ‘P’, because -p is
             already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the
             file.
     -p      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the
             original file.
     -q      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and
             diagnostic messages from ssh(1).
     -r      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that scp follows
             symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal.
     -S program
             Name of program to use for the encrypted connection.  The pro‐
             gram must understand ssh(1) options.
     -v      Verbose mode.  Causes scp and ssh(1) to print debugging mes‐
             sages about their progress.  This is helpful in debugging con‐
             nection, authentication, and configuration problems.
