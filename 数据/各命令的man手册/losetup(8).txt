       losetup is used to associate loop devices with regular files or block
       devices, to detach loop devices, and to query the status of a loop
       device.  If only the loopdev argument is given, the status of the
       corresponding loop device is shown.  If no option is given, all loop
       devices are shown.
       Note that the old output format (i.e., losetup -a) with comma-
       delimited strings is deprecated in favour of the --list output
       format.
       It's possible to create more independent loop devices for the same
       backing file.  This setup may be dangerous, can cause data loss,
       corruption and overwrites.  Use --nooverlap with --find during setup
       to avoid this problem.
