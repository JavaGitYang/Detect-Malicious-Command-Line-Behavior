       Section 8 of the manual describes commands which either can be or are
       used only by the superuser, like system-administration commands,
       daemons, and hardware-related commands.
       As with the commands described in Section 1, the commands described
       in this section terminate with an exit status that indicates whether
       the command succeeded or failed.  See intro(1) for more information.
