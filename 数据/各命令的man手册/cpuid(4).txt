       CPUID provides an interface for querying information about the x86
       CPU.
       This device is accessed by lseek(2) or pread(2) to the appropriate
       CPUID level and reading in chunks of 16 bytes.  A larger read size
       means multiple reads of consecutive levels.
       The lower 32 bits of the file position is used as the incoming %eax,
       and the upper 32 bits of the file position as the incoming %ecx, the
       latter intended for "counting" eax levels like eax=4.
       This driver uses /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/cpuid, where CPUNUM is the minor
       number, and on an SMP box will direct the access to CPU CPUNUM as
       listed in /proc/cpuinfo.
       This file is protected so that it can be read only by the user root,
       or members of the group root.
