       modinfo extracts information from the Linux Kernel modules given on
       the command line. If the module name is not a filename, then the
       /lib/modules/version directory is searched, as is also done by
       modprobe(8) when loading kernel modules.
       modinfo by default lists each attribute of the module in form
       fieldname : value, for easy reading. The filename is listed the same
       way (although it's not really an attribute).
       This version of modinfo can understand modules of any Linux Kernel
       architecture.
