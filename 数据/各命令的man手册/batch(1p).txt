       The batch utility shall read commands from standard input and
       schedule them for execution in a batch queue. It shall be the
       equivalent of the command:
           at −q b −m now
       where queue b is a special at queue, specifically for batch jobs.
       Batch jobs shall be submitted to the batch queue with no time
       constraints and shall be run by the system using algorithms, based on
       unspecified factors, that may vary with each invocation of batch.
       Users shall be permitted to use batch if their name appears in the
       file at.allow which is located in an implementation-defined
       directory.  If that file does not exist, the file at.deny, which is
       located in an implementation-defined directory, shall be checked to
       determine whether the user shall be denied access to batch.  If
       neither file exists, only a process with appropriate privileges shall
       be allowed to submit a job. If only at.deny exists and is empty,
       global usage shall be permitted. The at.allow and at.deny files shall
       consist of one user name per line.
