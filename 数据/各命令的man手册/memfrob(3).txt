       The memfrob() function encrypts the first n bytes of the memory area
       s by exclusive-ORing each character with the number 42.  The effect
       can be reversed by using memfrob() on the encrypted memory area.
       Note that this function is not a proper encryption routine as the XOR
       constant is fixed, and is suitable only for hiding strings.
