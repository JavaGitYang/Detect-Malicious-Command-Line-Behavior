       This routine provides a means to find out in what areas your program
       spends most of its time.  The argument buf points to bufsiz bytes of
       core.  Every virtual 10 milliseconds, the user's program counter (PC)
       is examined: offset is subtracted and the result is multiplied by
       scale and divided by 65536.  If the resulting value is less than
       bufsiz, then the corresponding entry in buf is incremented.  If buf
       is NULL, profiling is disabled.
