       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The setvbuf() function may be used after the stream pointed to by
       stream is associated with an open file but before any other operation
       (other than an unsuccessful call to setvbuf()) is performed on the
       stream. The argument type determines how stream shall be buffered, as
       follows:
        *  {_IOFBF} shall cause input/output to be fully buffered.
        *  {_IOLBF} shall cause input/output to be line buffered.
        *  {_IONBF} shall cause input/output to be unbuffered.
       If buf is not a null pointer, the array it points to may be used
       instead of a buffer allocated by setvbuf() and the argument size
       specifies the size of the array; otherwise, size may determine the
       size of a buffer allocated by the setvbuf() function. The contents of
       the array at any time are unspecified.
       For information about streams, see Section 2.5, Standard I/O Streams.
