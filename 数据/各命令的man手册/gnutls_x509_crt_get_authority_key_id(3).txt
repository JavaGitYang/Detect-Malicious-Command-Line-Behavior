       This function will return the X.509v3 certificate authority's key
       identifier.  This is obtained by the X.509 Authority Key identifier
       extension field (2.5.29.35). Note that this function only returns the
       keyIdentifier field of the extension and
       GNUTLS_E_X509_UNSUPPORTED_EXTENSION, if the extension contains the
       name and serial number of the certificate. In that case
       gnutls_x509_crt_get_authority_key_gn_serial() may be used.
