       semodule is the tool used to manage SELinux policy modules, including
       installing, upgrading, listing and removing modules.  semodule may
       also be used to force a rebuild of policy from the module store
       and/or to force a reload of policy without performing any other
       transaction.  semodule acts on module packages created by
       semodule_package.  Conventionally, these files have a .pp suffix
       (policy package), although this is not mandated in any way.
