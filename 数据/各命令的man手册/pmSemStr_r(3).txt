       Given a performance metric semantic, pmSemStr produces a terse ASCII
       equivalent, appropriate for use in error and diagnostic messages.
       The pmSemStr_r function does the same, but stores the result in a
       user-supplied buffer buf of length buflen, which should have room for
       at least 20 bytes.
       The value for sem is typically extracted from a pmDesc structure,
       following a call to pmLookupDesc(3) for a particular performance
       metric.
       Examples are counter (for sem equals PM_SEM_COUNTER), discrete (for
       sem equals PM_SEM_DISCRETE), instant (for sem equals PM_SEM_INSTANT),
       etc.
