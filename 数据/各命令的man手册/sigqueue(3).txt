       sigqueue() sends the signal specified in sig to the process whose PID
       is given in pid.  The permissions required to send a signal are the
       same as for kill(2).  As with kill(2), the null signal (0) can be
       used to check if a process with a given PID exists.
       The value argument is used to specify an accompanying item of data
       (either an integer or a pointer value) to be sent with the signal,
       and has the following type:
           union sigval {
               int   sival_int;
               void *sival_ptr;
           };
       If the receiving process has installed a handler for this signal
       using the SA_SIGINFO flag to sigaction(2), then it can obtain this
       data via the si_value field of the siginfo_t structure passed as the
       second argument to the handler.  Furthermore, the si_code field of
       that structure will be set to SI_QUEUE.
