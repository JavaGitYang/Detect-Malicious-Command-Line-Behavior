       Updates remote refs using local refs, while sending objects necessary
       to complete the given refs.
       You can make interesting things happen to a repository every time you
       push into it, by setting up hooks there. See documentation for
       git-receive-pack(1).
       When the command line does not specify where to push with the
       <repository> argument, branch.*.remote configuration for the current
       branch is consulted to determine where to push. If the configuration
       is missing, it defaults to origin.
       When the command line does not specify what to push with <refspec>...
       arguments or --all, --mirror, --tags options, the command finds the
       default <refspec> by consulting remote.*.push configuration, and if
       it is not found, honors push.default configuration to decide what to
       push (See git-config(1) for the meaning of push.default).
       When neither the command-line nor the configuration specify what to
       push, the default behavior is used, which corresponds to the simple
       value for push.default: the current branch is pushed to the
       corresponding upstream branch, but as a safety measure, the push is
       aborted if the upstream branch does not have the same name as the
       local one.
