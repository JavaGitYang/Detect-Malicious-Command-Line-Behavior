       The remove() function shall cause the file named by the pathname
       pointed to by path to be no longer accessible by that name. A
       subsequent attempt to open that file using that name shall fail,
       unless it is created anew.
       If path does not name a directory, remove(path) shall be equivalent
       to unlink(path).
       If path names a directory, remove(path) shall be equivalent to
       rmdir(path).
