       The macro offsetof() returns the offset of the field member from the
       start of the structure type.
       This macro is useful because the sizes of the fields that compose a
       structure can vary across implementations, and compilers may insert
       different numbers of padding bytes between fields.  Consequently, an
       element's offset is not necessarily given by the sum of the sizes of
       the previous elements.
       A compiler error will result if member is not aligned to a byte
       boundary (i.e., it is a bit field).
