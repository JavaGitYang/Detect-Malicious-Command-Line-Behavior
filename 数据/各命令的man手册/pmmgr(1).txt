       pmmgr manages a collection of PCP daemons for a set of discovered
       local and remote hosts running the Performance Metrics Collection
       Daemon (PMCD), according to zero or more configuration directories.
       It keeps a matching set of pmie, pmlogger, pmrep and other daemons
       running, and their archives/logs merged/rotated.  It provides an
       alternative to the default pmlogger_daily and pmie_daily scripts that
       administer pmlogger and pmie ``farms'' using cron(3).
       pmmgr is largely self-configuring and perseveres despite most run-
       time errors.  pmmgr runs in the foreground until interrupted.  When
       signaled, it will stop its running daemons before exiting.
