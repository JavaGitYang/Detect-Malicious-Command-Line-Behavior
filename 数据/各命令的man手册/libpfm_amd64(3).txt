       The library supports all AMD64 processors in both 32 and 64-bit
       modes.
       The support is broken down in three groups:
       AMD K7 processors (family 6)
       AMD K8 processors (family 15)
       AMD Family 10h processors (family 16)
       Each group has a distinct man page. See links below.
