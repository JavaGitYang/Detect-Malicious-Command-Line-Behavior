       systemd-socket-activate may be used to launch a socket-activated
       service binary from the command line for testing purposes. It may
       also be used to launch individual instances of the service binary per
       connection.
       The daemon to launch and its options should be specified after
       options intended for systemd-socket-activate.
       If the --inetd option is given, the socket file descriptor will be
       used as the standard input and output of the launched process.
       Otherwise, standard input and output will be inherited, and sockets
       will be passed through file descriptors 3 and higher. Sockets passed
       through $LISTEN_FDS to systemd-socket-activate will be passed through
       to the daemon, in the original positions. Other sockets specified
       with --listen= will use consecutive descriptors. By default,
       systemd-socket-activate listens on a stream socket, use --datagram
       and --seqpacket to listen on datagram or sequential packet sockets
       instead (see below).
