       The fc utility shall list, or shall edit and re-execute, commands
       previously entered to an interactive sh.
       The command history list shall reference commands by number. The
       first number in the list is selected arbitrarily. The relationship of
       a number to its command shall not change except when the user logs in
       and no other process is accessing the list, at which time the system
       may reset the numbering to start the oldest retained command at
       another number (usually 1). When the number reaches an
       implementation-defined upper limit, which shall be no smaller than
       the value in HISTSIZE or 32767 (whichever is greater), the shell may
       wrap the numbers, starting the next command with a lower number
       (usually 1). However, despite this optional wrapping of numbers, fc
       shall maintain the time-ordering sequence of the commands. For
       example, if four commands in sequence are given the numbers 32766,
       32767, 1 (wrapped), and 2 as they are executed, command 32767 is
       considered the command previous to 1, even though its number is
       higher.
       When commands are edited (when the −l option is not specified), the
       resulting lines shall be entered at the end of the history list and
       then re-executed by sh.  The fc command that caused the editing shall
       not be entered into the history list. If the editor returns a non-
       zero exit status, this shall suppress the entry into the history list
       and the command re-execution.  Any command line variable assignments
       or redirection operators used with fc shall affect both the fc
       command itself as well as the command that results; for example:
           fc −s −− −1 2>/dev/null
       reinvokes the previous command, suppressing standard error for both
       fc and the previous command.
