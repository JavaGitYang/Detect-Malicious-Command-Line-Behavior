       An application using the Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface (PMAPI) may manipulate several concurrent contexts, each
       associated with a source of performance metrics, e.g. pmcd(1) on some
       host, or a set of archive logs of performance metrics as created by
       pmlogger(1).
       Calling pmDupContext will replicate the current PMAPI context,
       returning a handle for the new context that may be used with
       subsequent calls to pmUseContext(3).
       Once created, the duplicated context and the original context have
       independent existence, and so their instance profiles and collection
       time (relevant only for archive contexts) may be independently
       varied.
       The newly replicated context becomes the current context.
