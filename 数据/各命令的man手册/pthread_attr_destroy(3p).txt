       The pthread_attr_destroy() function shall destroy a thread attributes
       object. An implementation may cause pthread_attr_destroy() to set
       attr to an implementation-defined invalid value. A destroyed attr
       attributes object can be reinitialized using pthread_attr_init(); the
       results of otherwise referencing the object after it has been
       destroyed are undefined.
       The pthread_attr_init() function shall initialize a thread attributes
       object attr with the default value for all of the individual
       attributes used by a given implementation.
       The resulting attributes object (possibly modified by setting
       individual attribute values) when used by pthread_create() defines
       the attributes of the thread created. A single attributes object can
       be used in multiple simultaneous calls to pthread_create().  Results
       are undefined if pthread_attr_init() is called specifying an already
       initialized attr attributes object.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_destroy() does not refer to an initialized thread
       attributes object.
