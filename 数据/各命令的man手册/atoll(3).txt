       The atoi() function converts the initial portion of the string
       pointed to by nptr to int.  The behavior is the same as
           strtol(nptr, NULL, 10);
       except that atoi() does not detect errors.
       The atol() and atoll() functions behave the same as atoi(), except
       that they convert the initial portion of the string to their return
       type of long or long long.
