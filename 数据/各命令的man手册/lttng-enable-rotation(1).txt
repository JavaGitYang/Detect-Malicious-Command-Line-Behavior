       The lttng enable-rotation command sets an automatic rotation schedule
       for the current tracing session, or for the tracing session named
       SESSION if provided. See lttng-rotate(1) for more information about
       the concepts of a tracing session rotation and a trace chunk.
       With the --timer option, the rotation schedule is set so that an
       automatic rotation occurs at least every PERIOD (microseconds without
       a unit suffix).
       With the --size option, the rotation schedule is set so that an
       automatic rotation occurs every time the total size of the flushed
       part of the current trace chunk is at least SIZE (bytes without a
       unit suffix).
       With both the --timer and --size options, LTTng checks the schedule
       condition periodically using the monitor timers of the tracing
       sessionâ€™s channels. This means that, with the --timer option, the
       automatic rotation can occur when the elapsed time since the last
       automatic rotation is greater than PERIOD, and with the --size
       option, the automatic rotation can occur when the size of the flushed
       part of the current trace chunk is greater than SIZE. See the
       --monitor-timer option in lttng-enable-channel(1) for more
       information about the monitor timer.
       The naming convention of a trace chunk archive which an automatic
       rotation creates is the same as with the manual rotation command,
       lttng-rotate(1).
       For a given tracing session, you cannot set multiple automatic
       rotation schedules with the --timer or the --size option.
       You can unset an automatic rotation schedule with the
       lttng-disable-rotation(1) command.
       See LIMITATIONS for important limitations regarding this command.
