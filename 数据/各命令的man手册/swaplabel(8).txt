       swaplabel will display or change the label or UUID of a swap
       partition located on device (or regular file).
       If the optional arguments -L and -U are not given, swaplabel will
       simply display the current swap-area label and UUID of device.
       If an optional argument is present, then swaplabel will change the
       appropriate value on device.  These values can also be set during
       swap creation using mkswap(8).  The swaplabel utility allows to
       change the label or UUID on an actively used swap device.
