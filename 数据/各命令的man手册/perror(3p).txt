       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The perror() function shall map the error number accessed through the
       symbol errno to a language-dependent error message, which shall be
       written to the standard error stream as follows:
        *  First (if s is not a null pointer and the character pointed to by
           s is not the null byte), the string pointed to by s followed by a
           <colon> and a <space>.
        *  Then an error message string followed by a <newline>.
       The contents of the error message strings shall be the same as those
       returned by strerror() with argument errno.
       The perror() function shall mark for update the last data
       modification and last file status change timestamps of the file
       associated with the standard error stream at some time between its
       successful completion and exit(), abort(), or the completion of
       fflush() or fclose() on stderr.
       The perror() function shall not change the orientation of the
       standard error stream.
       On error, perror() shall set the error indicator for the stream to
       which stderr points, and shall set errno to indicate the error.
       Since no value is returned, an application wishing to check for error
       situations should call clearerr(stderr) before calling perror(), then
       if ferror(stderr) returns non-zero, the value of errno indicates
       which error occurred.
