       Note: if you are looking for information about the sysfs filesystem
       that is normally mounted at /sys, see sysfs(5).
       The (obsolete) sysfs() system call returns information about the
       filesystem types currently present in the kernel.  The specific form
       of the sysfs() call and the information returned depends on the
       option in effect:
       1  Translate the filesystem identifier string fsname into a
          filesystem type index.
       2  Translate the filesystem type index fs_index into a null-
          terminated filesystem identifier string.  This string will be
          written to the buffer pointed to by buf.  Make sure that buf has
          enough space to accept the string.
       3  Return the total number of filesystem types currently present in
          the kernel.
       The numbering of the filesystem type indexes begins with zero.
