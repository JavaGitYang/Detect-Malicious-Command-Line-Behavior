       This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring
       into a given buffer. The arguments are:
         subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
         ovector       Offset vector that pcre[16|32]_exec() used
         stringcount   Value returned by pcre[16|32]_exec()
         stringnumber  Number of the required substring
         buffer        Buffer to receive the string
         buffersize    Size of buffer
       The yield is the length of the string, PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if the
       buffer was too small, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the string number
       is invalid.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
