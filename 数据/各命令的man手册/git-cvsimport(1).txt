       WARNING: git cvsimport uses cvsps version 2, which is considered
       deprecated; it does not work with cvsps version 3 and later. If you
       are performing a one-shot import of a CVS repository consider using
       cvs2git[1] or cvs-fast-export[2].
       Imports a CVS repository into Git. It will either create a new
       repository, or incrementally import into an existing one.
       Splitting the CVS log into patch sets is done by cvsps. At least
       version 2.1 is required.
       WARNING: for certain situations the import leads to incorrect
       results. Please see the section ISSUES for further reference.
       You should never do any work of your own on the branches that are
       created by git cvsimport. By default initial import will create and
       populate a "master" branch from the CVS repository’s main branch
       which you’re free to work with; after that, you need to git merge
       incremental imports, or any CVS branches, yourself. It is advisable
       to specify a named remote via -r to separate and protect the incoming
       branches.
       If you intend to set up a shared public repository that all
       developers can read/write, or if you want to use git-cvsserver(1),
       then you probably want to make a bare clone of the imported
       repository, and use the clone as the shared repository. See
       gitcvs-migration(7).
