       These functions operate in the same way as pthread_join(3), except
       for the differences described on this page.
       The pthread_tryjoin_np() function performs a nonblocking join with
       the thread thread, returning the exit status of the thread in
       *retval.  If thread has not yet terminated, then instead of blocking,
       as is done by pthread_join(3), the call returns an error.
       The pthread_timedjoin_np() function performs a join-with-timeout.  If
       thread has not yet terminated, then the call blocks until a maximum
       time, specified in abstime.  If the timeout expires before thread
       terminates, the call returns an error.  The abstime argument is a
       structure of the following form, specifying an absolute time measured
       since the Epoch (see time(2)):
           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;     /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;    /* nanoseconds */
           };
