       pmdagluster is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
       exports metric values about mounted gluster filesystems using the
       gluster(8) command.  This PMDA exports metrics about volumes and
       bricks both local and remote to the node where pmdagluster is
       running.
       The gluster filesystem supports fine-grained control over enabling
       statistics on individual volumes, so that the values are optionally
       enabled or disabled on systems where they are not desired to be
       monitored.
       The pmstore(1) command can be used to enable and disable profiling of
       volumes.  Using the individual instances of the
       gluster.volume.profile metric, one can set their values (and
       associated profiling) either on (1) or off (0).  Additionally,
       pminfo(1) can report on the current status of profiling of each
       volume.
            # pminfo ‐f gluster.volume.profile
            gluster.volume.profile
                inst [0 or "gv0"] value 0
                inst [1 or "gv1"] value 1
            # pmstore ‐i "gv0" gluster.volume.profile 1
            gluster.volume.profile inst [0 or "gv0"] old value=0 new value=1
