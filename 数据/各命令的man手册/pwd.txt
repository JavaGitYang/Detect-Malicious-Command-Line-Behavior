           char    *pw_shell  Program to use as shell.
       The <pwd.h> header shall define the gid_t, uid_t, and size_t types as
       described in <sys/types.h>.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           void           endpwent(void);
           struct passwd *getpwent(void);
           struct passwd *getpwnam(const char *);
           int            getpwnam_r(const char *, struct passwd *, char *,
                              size_t, struct passwd **);
           struct passwd *getpwuid(uid_t);
           int            getpwuid_r(uid_t, struct passwd *, char *,
                              size_t, struct passwd **);
           void           setpwent(void);
