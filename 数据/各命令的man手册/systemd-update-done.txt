       systemd-update-done.service is a service that is invoked as part of
       the first boot after the vendor operating system resources in /usr
       have been updated. This is useful to implement offline updates of
       /usr which might require updates to /etc or /var on the following
       boot.
       systemd-update-done.service updates the file modification time
       (mtime) of the stamp files /etc/.updated and /var/.updated to the
       modification time of the /usr directory, unless the stamp files are
       already newer.
       Services that shall run after offline upgrades of /usr should order
       themselves before systemd-update-done.service, and use the
       ConditionNeedsUpdate= (see systemd.unit(5)) condition to make sure to
       run when /etc or /var are older than /usr according to the
       modification times of the files described above. This requires that
       updates to /usr are always followed by an update of the modification
       time of /usr, for example by invoking touch(1) on it.
