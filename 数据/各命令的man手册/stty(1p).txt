       The stty utility shall set or report on terminal I/O characteristics
       for the device that is its standard input. Without options or
       operands specified, it shall report the settings of certain
       characteristics, usually those that differ from implementation-
       defined defaults.  Otherwise, it shall modify the terminal state
       according to the specified operands. Detailed information about the
       modes listed in the first five groups below are described in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, Chapter 11, General Terminal
       Interface.  Operands in the Combination Modes group (see Combination
       Modes) are implemented using operands in the previous groups. Some
       combinations of operands are mutually-exclusive on some terminal
       types; the results of using such combinations are unspecified.
       Typical implementations of this utility require a communications line
       configured to use the termios interface defined in the System
       Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2008. On systems where none of these
       lines are available, and on lines not currently configured to support
       the termios interface, some of the operands need not affect terminal
       characteristics.
