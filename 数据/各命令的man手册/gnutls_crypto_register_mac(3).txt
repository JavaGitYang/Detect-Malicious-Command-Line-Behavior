       This function will register a MAC algorithm to be used by gnutls.
       Any algorithm registered will override the included algorithms and by
       convention kernel implemented algorithms have priority of 90 and
       CPU-assisted of 80.  The algorithm with the lowest priority will be
       used by gnutls.
