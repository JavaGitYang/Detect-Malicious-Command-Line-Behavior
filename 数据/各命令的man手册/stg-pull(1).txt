       Pull the latest changes from the given remote repository (defaulting
       to branch.<name>.remote, or origin if not set). This command works by
       popping all the patches from the stack, pulling the changes in the
       parent repository, setting the base of the stack to the latest parent
       HEAD and pushing the patches back (unless --nopush is specified). The
       push operation can fail if there are conflicts. They need to be
       resolved and the patch pushed again.
       Check the git fetch documentation for the <repository> format.
