       These routine have been deprecated and may be removed in a future
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) release.  Please refer to pmSetDebug(3)
       and pmClearDebug(3) for replacement functionality.
       __pmParseDebug parses spec assuming it to be a comma separated list
       of PCP debug flags.
       Each flag may be specified as an integer or the trailing portion of
       the symbolic name of the corresponding flag as reported by pmdbg(1).
       Symbolic names are stripped of the ``DBG_TRACE_'' prefix and may
       appear in either case.
       As a special case, the values ``-1'' and ``ALL'' are treated as
       synonyms for turning on all bits except the sign bit in the result,
       i.e. INT_MAX from <limits.h>.
       For example the debug option fetch is defined in the output from
       pmdbg(3) with the -L option and may be specified in spec as 2, FETCH
       or fetch.
       __pmSetDebugBits may be used to set the bit-fields directly using the
       encoding in value.  The effect is additive, so consecutive calls to
       __pmSetDebugBits will set the conjunction of the bits in the value
       arguments.  To clear the bit-fields, see pmClearDebug(3).
