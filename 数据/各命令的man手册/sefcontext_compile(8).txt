       sefcontext_compile is used to compile file context regular
       expressions into pcre(3) format.
       The compiled file is used by libselinux file labeling functions.
       By default sefcontext_compile writes the compiled pcre file with the
       .bin suffix appended (e.g. inputfile.bin).
