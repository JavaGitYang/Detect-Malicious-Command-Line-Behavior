       pcap_open_live() is used to obtain a packet capture handle to look at
       packets on the network.  device is a string that specifies the
       network device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a
       device argument of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from
       all interfaces.
       snaplen specifies the snapshot length to be set on the handle.
       promisc specifies if the interface is to be put into promiscuous
       mode.
       to_ms specifies the packet buffer timeout, as a non-negative value,
       in milliseconds.  (See pcap(3PCAP) for an explanation of the packet
       buffer timeout.)
