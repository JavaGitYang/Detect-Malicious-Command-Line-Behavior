       __pmParseCtime reverses the asctime(3) function.  It accepts a string
       specifying a time, and fills in the given tm structure.
       Either a fully specified asctime(3) string like "Mon Mar  4 13:07:47
       1996" or a partially specified time like '1996", "Mar 1996", "Mar 4
       1996", "Mar", "13:07:47", "13:07", "Mar 4 13:07:47",... is accepted.
       In addition, the seconds component may be a floating point number,
       for example "13:07:47.5".  The 12 hour clock is also supported, so
       "13:07" and "1:07 pm" are equivalent.
       __pmParseCtime returns 0 if successful.  It returns -1 and a
       dynamically allocated error message string in errmsg, if the given
       string does not parse.  Be sure to free(3) the error message string.
       The tm structure returned in rslt should only be used as an argument
       to the __pmConvertTime function, as it contains encoded information
       that will only be correctly interpreted by __pmConvertTime.
