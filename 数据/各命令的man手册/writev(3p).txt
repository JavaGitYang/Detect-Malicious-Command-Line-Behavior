       The writev() function shall be equivalent to write(), except as
       described below. The writev() function shall gather output data from
       the iovcnt buffers specified by the members of the iov array: iov[0],
       iov[1], ..., iov[iovcntâˆ’1].  The iovcnt argument is valid if greater
       than 0 and less than or equal to {IOV_MAX}, as defined in <limits.h>.
       Each iovec entry specifies the base address and length of an area in
       memory from which data should be written. The writev() function shall
       always write a complete area before proceeding to the next.
       If fildes refers to a regular file and all of the iov_len members in
       the array pointed to by iov are 0, writev() shall return 0 and have
       no other effect. For other file types, the behavior is unspecified.
       If the sum of the iov_len values is greater than {SSIZE_MAX}, the
       operation shall fail and no data shall be transferred.
