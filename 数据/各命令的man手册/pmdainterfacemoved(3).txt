       After a call to either pmdaDaemon(3) or pmdaDSO(3) to initialize the
       pmdaInterface structure, if the caller needs to relocate or move the
       structure for any reason then pmdaInterfaceMoved needs to be called
       with the new base address of the pmdaInterface routine as specified
       by dispatch.
       pmdaInterfaceMoved will re-establish the internal integrity of the
       pmdaInterface structure at the new location before any other routine
       in libpcp_pmda called.
