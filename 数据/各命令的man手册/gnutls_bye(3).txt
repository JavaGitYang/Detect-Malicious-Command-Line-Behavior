       Terminates the current TLS/SSL connection. The connection should have
       been initiated using gnutls_handshake().   how should be one of
       GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR, GNUTLS_SHUT_WR.
       In case of GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR the TLS session gets terminated and
       further receives and sends will be disallowed.  If the return value
       is zero you may continue using the underlying transport layer.
       GNUTLS_SHUT_RDWR sends an alert containing a close request and waits
       for the peer to reply with the same message.
       In case of GNUTLS_SHUT_WR the TLS session gets terminated and further
       sends will be disallowed. In order to reuse the connection you should
       wait for an EOF from the peer.  GNUTLS_SHUT_WR sends an alert
       containing a close request.
       Note that not all implementations will properly terminate a TLS
       connection.  Some of them, usually for performance reasons, will
       terminate only the underlying transport layer, and thus not
       distinguishing between a malicious party prematurely terminating the
       connection and normal termination.
       This function may also return GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED;
       cf.  gnutls_record_get_direction().
