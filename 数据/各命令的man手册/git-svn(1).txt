       git svn is a simple conduit for changesets between Subversion and
       Git. It provides a bidirectional flow of changes between a Subversion
       and a Git repository.
       git svn can track a standard Subversion repository, following the
       common "trunk/branches/tags" layout, with the --stdlayout option. It
       can also follow branches and tags in any layout with the -T/-t/-b
       options (see options to init below, and also the clone command).
       Once tracking a Subversion repository (with any of the above
       methods), the Git repository can be updated from Subversion by the
       fetch command and Subversion updated from Git by the dcommit command.
