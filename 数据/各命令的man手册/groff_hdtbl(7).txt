       The hdtbl macros consist of four base and three optional macros,
       controlled by about twenty arguments.  The syntax is simple and
       similar to the HTML table model and nearly as flexible: You can write
       sequences of tokens (macro calls with their arguments and content
       data), separated by blanks and beginning with a macro call, into the
       same line to get compact and cleanly arrranged input.  An advantage
       of hdtbl is that the tables are constructed without calling a
       preprocessor; this means that groff's full macro capabilities are
       available.  On the other hand, table processing with hdtbl is much
       slower than using the tbl(1) preprocessor.  A further advantage is
       that the HTML-like syntax of hdtbl will be easily converted to HTML;
       this is not implemented yet.
