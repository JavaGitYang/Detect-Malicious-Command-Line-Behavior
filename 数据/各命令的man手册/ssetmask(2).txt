       These system calls are obsolete.  Do not use them; use sigprocmask(2)
       instead.
       sgetmask() returns the signal mask of the calling process.
       ssetmask() sets the signal mask of the calling process to the value
       given in newmask.  The previous signal mask is returned.
       The signal masks dealt with by these two system calls are plain bit
       masks (unlike the sigset_t used by sigprocmask(2)); use sigmask(3) to
       create and inspect these masks.
