       An ACL is a list of permissions associated with a file or directory
       and consists of one or more Access Control Entries (ACEs).  NFSv4
       ACLs provide finer granularity than typical POSIX read/write/execute
       permissions and are similar to CIFS ACLs.
       A sample NFSv4 file ACL might look like the following (see the ACL
       FORMAT section for detailed information):
              A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy
              A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
              A::bob@nfsdomain.org:rwadtTnNcCy
              A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
              D:g:GROUP@:waxTC
              A::EVERYONE@:rtncy
              D::EVERYONE@:waxTC
       Some observations:
       -  In the example output above, the user `alice@nfsdomain.org' has
          the equivalent of "read" and "execute" permissions,
          `bob@nfsdomain.org' has "read" and "write", and both `GROUP@' and
          `EVERYONE@' have "read".
       -  NFSv4 ACLs are "default-deny"; that is, if a permission is not
          explicitly granted by an Allow ACE, it is denied.  Because of
          this, the two Deny ACEs above are superfluous and could be
          excluded by the server.  See the A WARNING ABOUT DENY ACES section
          for more information.
       -  NFSv4 servers may return an ACL slightly different than one you
          set.  For example, a server that always allows reading the
          attributes of a file may silently turn on the read-attributes
          permission, and a server that does not support separate write-data
          and append-data permissions, e.g., may choose to turn off both if
          you set only one.  In extreme cases the server may also reorder or
          combine ACEs.  As a general rule, however, servers will attempt to
          ensure that the ACLs they return are no more permissive than the
          ones you set.
