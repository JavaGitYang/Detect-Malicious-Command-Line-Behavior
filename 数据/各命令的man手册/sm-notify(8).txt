       File locks are not part of persistent file system state.  Lock state
       is thus lost when a host reboots.
       Network file systems must also detect when lock state is lost because
       a remote host has rebooted.  After an NFS client reboots, an NFS
       server must release all file locks held by applications that were
       running on that client.  After a server reboots, a client must remind
       the server of file locks held by applications running on that client.
       For NFS version 2 and version 3, the Network Status Monitor protocol
       (or NSM for short) is used to notify NFS peers of reboots.  On Linux,
       two separate user-space components constitute the NSM service:
       sm-notify
              A helper program that notifies NFS peers after the local
              system reboots
       rpc.statd
              A daemon that listens for reboot notifications from other
              hosts, and manages the list of hosts to be notified when the
              local system reboots
       The local NFS lock manager alerts its local rpc.statd of each remote
       peer that should be monitored.  When the local system reboots, the
       sm-notify command notifies the NSM service on monitored peers of the
       reboot.  When a remote reboots, that peer notifies the local
       rpc.statd, which in turn passes the reboot notification back to the
       local NFS lock manager.
