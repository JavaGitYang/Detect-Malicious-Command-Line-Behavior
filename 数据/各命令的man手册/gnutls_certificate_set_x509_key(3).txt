       This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called
       more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.  For clients that wants to send more than their own end
       entity certificate (e.g., also an intermediate CA cert) then put the
       certificate chain in  cert_list .
       Note that the certificates and keys provided, can be safely
       deinitialized after this function is called.
       If that function fails to load the  res type is at an undefined
       state, it must not be reused to load other keys or certificates.
       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
       negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags()
       it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be
       used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.
