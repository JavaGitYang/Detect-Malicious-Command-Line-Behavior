       This function will allocate buffer and copy the name of issuer of the
       Certificate.  The name will be in the form "C=xxxx,O=yyyy,CN=zzzz" as
       described in RFC4514. The output string will be ASCII or UTF-8
       encoded, depending on the certificate data.
       When the flag GNUTLS_X509_DN_FLAG_COMPAT is specified, the output
       format will match the format output by previous to 3.5.6 versions of
       GnuTLS which was not not fully RFC4514-compliant.
