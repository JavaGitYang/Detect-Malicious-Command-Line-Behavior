       The vipw and vigr commands edits the files /etc/passwd and
       /etc/group, respectively. With the -s flag, they will edit the shadow
       versions of those files, /etc/shadow and /etc/gshadow, respectively.
       The programs will set the appropriate locks to prevent file
       corruption. When looking for an editor, the programs will first try
       the environment variable $VISUAL, then the environment variable
       $EDITOR, and finally the default editor, vi(1).
