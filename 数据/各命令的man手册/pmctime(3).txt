       pmCtime is very similar to ctime(3), except the timezone used is the
       current ``reporting timezone'' (rather than the default TZ
       environment variable scheme), and the result is returned into a
       caller-declared buffer (rather than a private buffer).
       Like ctime(3) the time to be converted is passed via clock, and the
       result in buf is fixed width fields in the format:
                 Fri Sep 13 00:00:00 1986\n\0
       The result buffer buf must be at least 26 bytes long, and no attempt
       is made to check this.  pmCtime returns buf as the value of the
       function.
       The default current reporting timezone is as defined by the TZ
       environment variable, so pmCtime and ctime(3) will initially produce
       similar encoding of the date and time.
       Use pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or pmUseZone(3) to establish a
       new current reporting timezone that will effect pmCtime but not
       ctime(3).
