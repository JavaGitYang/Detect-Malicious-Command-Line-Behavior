       setfilecon() sets the security context of the file system object.
       lsetfilecon() is identical to setfilecon, except in the case of a
       symbolic link, where the link itself has it's context set, not the
       file that it refers to.
       fsetfilecon() is identical to setfilecon, only the open file pointed
       to by filedes (as returned by open(2)) has it's context set in place
       of path.
       setfilecon_raw(), lsetfilecon_raw(), and fsetfilecon_raw() behave
       identically to their non-raw counterparts but do not perform context
       translation.
