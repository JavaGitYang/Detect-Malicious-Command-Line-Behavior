       Arp manipulates or displays the kernel's IPv4 network neighbour
       cache. It can add entries to the table, delete one or display the
       current content.
       ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol, which is used to find the
       media access control address of a network neighbour for a given IPv4
       Address.
