       The Motorola DSP56001 is a fully programmable 24-bit digital signal
       processor found in Atari Falcon030-compatible computers.  The dsp56k
       special file is used to control the DSP56001, and to send and receive
       data using the bidirectional handshaked host port.
       To send a data stream to the signal processor, use write(2) to the
       device, and read(2) to receive processed data.  The data can be sent
       or received in 8, 16, 24, or 32-bit quantities on the host side, but
       will always be seen as 24-bit quantities in the DSP56001.
       The following ioctl(2) calls are used to control the dsp56k device:
       DSP56K_UPLOAD
              resets the DSP56001 and uploads a program.  The third ioctl(2)
              argument must be a pointer to a struct dsp56k_binary with
              members bin pointing to a DSP56001 binary program, and len set
              to the length of the program, counted in 24-bit words.
       DSP56K_SET_TX_WSIZE
              sets the transmit word size.  Allowed values are in the range
              1 to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be sent at a time
              to the DSP56001.  These data quantities will either be padded
              with zero bytes, or truncated to fit the native 24-bit data
              format of the DSP56001.
       DSP56K_SET_RX_WSIZE
              sets the receive word size.  Allowed values are in the range 1
              to 4, and is the number of bytes that will be received at a
              time from the DSP56001.  These data quantities will either
              truncated, or padded with a null byte ('\0') to fit the native
              24-bit data format of the DSP56001.
       DSP56K_HOST_FLAGS
              read and write the host flags.  The host flags are four
              general-purpose bits that can be read by both the hosting
              computer and the DSP56001.  Bits 0 and 1 can be written by the
              host, and bits 2 and 3 can be written by the DSP56001.
              To access the host flags, the third ioctl(2) argument must be
              a pointer to a struct dsp56k_host_flags.  If bit 0 or 1 is set
              in the dir member, the corresponding bit in out will be
              written to the host flags.  The state of all host flags will
              be returned in the lower four bits of the status member.
       DSP56K_HOST_CMD
              sends a host command.  Allowed values are in the range 0 to
              31, and is a user-defined command handled by the program
              running in the DSP56001.
