       pmdate displays the current date and/or time, with an optional
       offset.
       An offset is specified with a leading sign (``+'' or ``-''), followed
       by an integer value, followed by one of the following ``scale''
       specifiers;
       S      seconds
       M      minutes
       H      hours
       d      days
       m      months
       y      years
       The output format follows the same rules as for date(1) and
       strftime(3).
       For example, the following will display the date a week ago as
       DDMMYYYY;
               pmdate -7d %d%m%Y
