       cryptsetup is used to conveniently setup dm-crypt managed device-
       mapper mappings. These include plain dm-crypt volumes and LUKS
       volumes. The difference is that LUKS uses a metadata header and can
       hence offer more features than plain dm-crypt. On the other hand, the
       header is visible and vulnerable to damage.
       In addition, cryptsetup provides limited support for the use of loop-
       AES volumes and for TrueCrypt compatible volumes.
