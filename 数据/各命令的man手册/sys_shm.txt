       The <sys/shm.h> header shall define the following symbolic constants:
       SHM_RDONLY  Attach read-only (else read-write).
       SHM_RND     Round attach address to SHMLBA.
       SHMLBA      Segment low boundary address multiple.
       The <sys/shm.h> header shall define the following data types through
       typedef:
       shmatt_t    Unsigned integer used for the number of current attaches
                   that must be able to store values at least as large as a
                   type unsigned short.
       The <sys/shm.h> header shall define the shmid_ds structure, which
       shall include the following members:
           struct ipc_perm shm_perm   Operation permission structure.
           size_t          shm_segsz  Size of segment in bytes.
           pid_t           shm_lpid   Process ID of last shared memory operation.
           pid_t           shm_cpid   Process ID of creator.
           shmatt_t        shm_nattch Number of current attaches.
           time_t          shm_atime  Time of last shmat().
           time_t          shm_dtime  Time of last shmdt().
           time_t          shm_ctime  Time of last change by shmctl().
       The <sys/shm.h> header shall define the pid_t, size_t, and time_t
       types as described in <sys/types.h>.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           void *shmat(int, const void *, int);
           int   shmctl(int, int, struct shmid_ds *);
           int   shmdt(const void *);
           int   shmget(key_t, size_t, int);
       In addition, the <sys/shm.h> header shall include the <sys/ipc.h>
       header.
