       This mkfs frontend is deprecated in favour of filesystem specific
       mkfs.<type> utils.
       mkfs is used to build a Linux filesystem on a device, usually a hard
       disk partition.  The device argument is either the device name (e.g.
       /dev/hda1, /dev/sdb2), or a regular file that shall contain the
       filesystem.  The size argument is the number of blocks to be used for
       the filesystem.
       The exit code returned by mkfs is 0 on success and 1 on failure.
       In actuality, mkfs is simply a front-end for the various filesystem
       builders (mkfs.fstype) available under Linux.  The filesystem-
       specific builder is searched for via your PATH environment setting
       only.  Please see the filesystem-specific builder manual pages for
       further details.
