       The iswprint() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       isprint(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "print".
       The wide-character class "print" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "cntrl".
       The wide-character class "print" contains the wide-character class
       "graph".
