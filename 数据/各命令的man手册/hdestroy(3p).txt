       The hcreate(), hdestroy(), and hsearch() functions shall manage hash
       search tables.
       The hcreate() function shall allocate sufficient space for the table,
       and the application shall ensure it is called before hsearch() is
       used. The nel argument is an estimate of the maximum number of
       entries that the table shall contain. This number may be adjusted
       upward by the algorithm in order to obtain certain mathematically
       favorable circumstances.
       The hdestroy() function shall dispose of the search table, and may be
       followed by another call to hcreate().  After the call to hdestroy(),
       the data can no longer be considered accessible.
       The hsearch() function is a hash-table search routine. It shall
       return a pointer into a hash table indicating the location at which
       an entry can be found. The item argument is a structure of type ENTRY
       (defined in the <search.h> header) containing two pointers: item.key
       points to the comparison key (a char *), and item.data (a void *)
       points to any other data to be associated with that key. The
       comparison function used by hsearch() is strcmp().  The action
       argument is a member of an enumeration type ACTION indicating the
       disposition of the entry if it cannot be found in the table. ENTER
       indicates that the item should be inserted in the table at an
       appropriate point. FIND indicates that no entry should be made.
       Unsuccessful resolution is indicated by the return of a null pointer.
       These functions need not be thread-safe.
