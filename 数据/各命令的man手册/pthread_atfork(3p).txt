       The pthread_atfork() function shall declare fork handlers to be
       called before and after fork(), in the context of the thread that
       called fork().  The prepare fork handler shall be called before
       fork() processing commences. The parent fork handle shall be called
       after fork() processing completes in the parent process. The child
       fork handler shall be called after fork() processing completes in the
       child process. If no handling is desired at one or more of these
       three points, the corresponding fork handler address(es) may be set
       to NULL.
       The order of calls to pthread_atfork() is significant. The parent and
       child fork handlers shall be called in the order in which they were
       established by calls to pthread_atfork().  The prepare fork handlers
       shall be called in the opposite order.
