       sctp_send is a wrapper library function that can be used to send a
       message from a socket without the use of the CMSG header structures.
       sd is the socket descriptor from which the message pointed to by msg
       of length len is sent.  sinfo is a pointer to a sctp_sndrcvinfo
       structure.  flags parameter is composed of a bitwise OR of the flags
       that can be be passed as the 3rd argument of a standard sendmsg()
       call.
