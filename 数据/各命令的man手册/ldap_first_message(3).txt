       These routines are used to step through the messages in a result
       chain received from ldap_result(3).  For search operations, the
       result chain can contain referral, entry and result messages. The
       ldap_msgtype(3) function can be used to distinguish between the
       different message types.
       The ldap_first_message() routine is used to retrieve the first
       message in a result chain.  It takes the result as returned by a call
       to ldap_result(3), ldap_search_s(3) or ldap_search_st(3) and returns
       a pointer to the first message in the result chain.
       This pointer should be supplied on a subsequent call to
       ldap_next_message() to get the next message, the result of which
       should be supplied to the next call to ldap_next_message(), etc.
       ldap_next_message() will return NULL when there are no more messages.
       These functions are useful when using routines like
       ldap_parse_result(3) that only operate on the first result in the
       chain.
       A count of the number of messages in the result chain can be obtained
       by calling ldap_count_messages().  It can also be used to count the
       number of remaining messages in a chain if called with a message,
       entry or reference returned by ldap_first_message() ,
       ldap_next_message() , ldap_first_entry(3), ldap_next_entry(3),
       ldap_first_reference(3), ldap_next_reference(3).
