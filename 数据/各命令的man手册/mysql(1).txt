       mysql is a simple SQL shell (with GNU readline capabilities). It
       supports interactive and non-interactive use. When used
       interactively, query results are presented in an ASCII-table format.
       When used non-interactively (for example, as a filter), the result is
       presented in tab-separated format. The output format can be changed
       using command options.
       If you have problems due to insufficient memory for large result
       sets, use the --quick option. This forces mysql to retrieve results
       from the server a row at a time rather than retrieving the entire
       result set and buffering it in memory before displaying it. This is
       done by returning the result set using the mysql_use_result() C API
       function in the client/server library rather than
       mysql_store_result().
       Using mysql is very easy. Invoke it from the prompt of your command
       interpreter as follows:
           shell> mysql db_name
       Or:
           shell> mysql --user=user_name --password=your_password db_name
       Then type an SQL statement, end it with “;”, \g, or \G and press
       Enter.
       Typing Control-C causes mysql to attempt to kill the current
       statement. If this cannot be done, or Control-C is typed again before
       the statement is killed, mysql exits.
       You can execute SQL statements in a script file (batch file) like
       this:
           shell> mysql db_name < script.sql > output.tab
