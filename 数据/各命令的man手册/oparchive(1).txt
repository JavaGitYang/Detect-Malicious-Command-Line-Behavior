       The oparchive utility is commonly used for collecting profile data on
       a "target" system for future offline analysis on a different ("host")
       machine.  oparchive creates a directory populated with executables,
       libraries, debuginfo files, and oprofile sample files. This directory
       can be tar'ed up and moved to another machine to be analyzed without
       further use of the target machine. Using opreport and other post-
       profiling tools against archived data requires the use of the
       archive:<archived-dir> specification. See oprofile(1) for how to
       write profile specifications.  A complete description of offline
       analysis can be found in the chapter titled Analyzing profile data on
       another system (oparchive) of the OProfile user manual. (See the user
       manual URL in the "SEE ALSO" section below.)
