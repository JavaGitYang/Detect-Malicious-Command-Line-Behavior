       selinux_file_context_verify() compares the context of the specified
       path that is held on disk (in the extended attribute), to the system
       default entry held in the file contexts series of files.
       The mode may be zero.
       Note that the two contexts are compared for "significant" differences
       (i.e. the user component of the contexts are ignored) as shown in the
       EXAMPLE section.
