       This function will inform about known DN OIDs. This is useful since
       functions like gnutls_x509_crt_set_dn_by_oid() use the information on
       known OIDs to properly encode their input. Object Identifiers that
       are not known are not encoded by these functions, and their input is
       stored directly into the ASN.1 structure. In that case of unknown
       OIDs, you have the responsibility of DER encoding your data.
