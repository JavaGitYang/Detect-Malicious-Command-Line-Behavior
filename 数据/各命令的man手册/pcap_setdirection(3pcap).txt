       pcap_setdirection() is used to specify a direction that packets will
       be captured.  d is one of the constants PCAP_D_IN, PCAP_D_OUT or
       PCAP_D_INOUT.  PCAP_D_IN will only capture packets received by the
       device, PCAP_D_OUT will only capture packets sent by the device and
       PCAP_D_INOUT will capture packets received by or sent by the device.
       PCAP_D_INOUT is the default setting if this function is not called.
       pcap_setdirection() isn't necessarily fully supported on all
       platforms; some platforms might return an error for all values, and
       some other platforms might not support PCAP_D_OUT.
       This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being read.
