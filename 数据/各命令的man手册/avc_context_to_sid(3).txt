       Security ID's (SID's) are opaque representations of security
       contexts, managed by the userspace AVC.
       avc_context_to_sid() returns a SID for the given context in the
       memory referenced by sid.
       avc_sid_to_context() returns a copy of the context represented by sid
       in the memory referenced by ctx.  The user must free the copy with
       freecon(3).
       avc_get_initial_sid() returns a SID for the kernel initial security
       identifier specified by name.
