       dpkg-shlibdeps calculates shared library dependencies for executables
       named in its arguments. The dependencies are added to the
       substitution variables file debian/substvars as variable names
       shlibs:dependency-field where dependency-field is a dependency field
       name. Any other variables starting with shlibs: are removed from the
       file.
       dpkg-shlibdeps has two possible sources of information to generate
       dependency information. Either symbols files or shlibs files. For
       each binary that dpkg-shlibdeps analyzes, it finds out the list of
       libraries that it's linked with.  Then, for each library, it looks up
       either the symbols file, or the shlibs file (if the former doesn't
       exist or if debian/shlibs.local contains the relevant dependency).
       Both files are supposed to be provided by the library package and
       should thus be available as
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/package.symbols or
       /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/info/package.shlibs. The package name is
       identified in two steps: find the library file on the system (looking
       in the same directories that ld.so would use), then use dpkg -S
       library-file to lookup the package providing the library.
   Symbols files
       Symbols files contain finer-grained dependency information by
       providing the minimum dependency for each symbol that the library
       exports. The script tries to find a symbols file associated to a
       library package in the following places (first match is used):
       debian/*/DEBIAN/symbols
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked dpkg-shlibdeps.  They are generated
              by dpkg-gensymbols(1).  They are only used if the library is
              found in a package's build tree. The symbols file in that
              build tree takes precedence over symbols files from other
              binary packages.
       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/package.symbols.arch
       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/symbols/package.symbols
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
              arch is the architecture of the current system (obtained by
              dpkg-architecture -qDEB_HOST_ARCH).
       Output from “dpkg-query --control-path package symbols”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by --admindir, those files are located in
              /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.
       While scanning the symbols used by all binaries, dpkg-shlibdeps
       remembers the (biggest) minimal version needed for each library. At
       the end of the process, it is able to write out the minimal
       dependency for every library used (provided that the information of
       the symbols files are accurate).
       As a safe-guard measure, a symbols file can provide a
       Build-Depends-Package meta-information field and dpkg-shlibdeps will
       extract the minimal version required by the corresponding package in
       the Build-Depends field and use this version if it's higher than the
       minimal version computed by scanning symbols.
   Shlibs files
       Shlibs files associate directly a library to a dependency (without
       looking at the symbols). It's thus often stronger than really needed
       but very safe and easy to handle.
       The dependencies for a library are looked up in several places. The
       first file providing information for the library of interest is used:
       debian/shlibs.local
              Package-local overriding shared library dependency
              information.
       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.override
              Per-system overriding shared library dependency information.
       debian/*/DEBIAN/shlibs
              Shared library information generated by the current build
              process that also invoked dpkg-shlibdeps.  They are only used
              if the library is found in a package's build tree. The shlibs
              file in that build tree takes precedence over shlibs files
              from other binary packages.
       Output from “dpkg-query --control-path package shlibs”
              Package-provided shared library dependency information.
              Unless overridden by --admindir, those files are located in
              /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.
       /usr/local/etc/dpkg/shlibs.default
              Per-system default shared library dependency information.
       The extracted dependencies are then directly used (except if they are
       filtered out because they have been identified as duplicate, or as
       weaker than another dependency).
