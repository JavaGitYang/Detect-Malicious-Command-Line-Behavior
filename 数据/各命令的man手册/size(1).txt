       The GNU size utility lists the section sizes---and the total
       size---for each of the object or archive files objfile in its
       argument list.  By default, one line of output is generated for each
       object file or each module in an archive.
       objfile... are the object files to be examined.  If none are
       specified, the file "a.out" will be used.
