       Reads a PIC program as input; produces an image file (by default in
       Portable Network Graphics format) suitable for the Web as output.
       Also translates eqn(1) constructs, so it can be used for generating
       images of mathematical formulae.
       PIC is a rather expressive graphics minilanguage suitable for
       producing box-and-arrow diagrams of the kind frequently used in
       technical papers and textbooks.  The language is sufficiently
       flexible to be quite useful for state charts, Petri-net diagrams,
       flow charts, simple circuit schematics, jumper layouts, and other
       kinds of illustration involving repetitive uses of simple geometric
       forms and splines.  Because PIC descriptions are procedural and
       object-based, they are both compact and easy to modify.
       The PIC language is fully documented in Making Pictures With GNU PIC,
       a document which is part of the groff(1) distribution.
       Your input PIC code should not be wrapped with the .PS and .PE macros
       that normally guard it within groff(1) macros.
       The output image will be clipped to the smallest possible bounding
       box that contains all the black pixels.  Older versions of convert(1)
       will produce a black-on-white graphic; newer ones may produce a
       black-on-transparent graphic.  By specifying command-line options to
       be passed to convert(1) you can give it a border, force the
       background transparent, set the image's pixel density, or perform
       other useful transformations.
       This program uses pic(1), eqn(1), groff(1), gs(1), and the
       ImageMagick convert(1) program.  These programs must be installed on
       your system and accessible on your $PATH for pic2graph to work.
