       These functions shall return the floating-point remainder r=x−ny when
       y is non-zero. The value n is the integral value nearest the exact
       value x/y.  When |n−x/y|=½, the value n is chosen to be even.
       The behavior of remainder() shall be independent of the rounding
       mode.
