       pmlogsize prints information about the size of the index, metadata
       and data sections of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive.  The
       output is intended to guide improvements in archive encoding format
       for PCP developers and to help trim pmlogger(1) configuration files
       to remove metrics that are bloating the PCP archives with low-value
       data in production environments.
       The archive arguments can be any mixture of the names of the physical
       files of a PCP archive or the basename that is common to all the
       component physical files in a single archive.  In the latter case
       archive is replaced by a list of all of the matching component file
       names.
       Note the semantics is a little different to other PCP tools in that
       foo.meta means just the file foo.meta, not foo.index, foo.meta,
       foo.0, etc.
       The -d flag requests more detailed reporting.  This means space per
       instance domain in a metadata file and space per metric (for values)
       in a data file.
       The -r flag requests additional information about possible replicated
       values in the data file and replicated instances in the metadata
       file.  It implies -d.
       When the -d (or -r) flag is specified, the -x flag may be used to cut
       off the report after at least thres percent of the associated space
       (metric values or instance domains) has been reported.  The default
       behaviour is equivalent to thres being set to 100.
       Additional verbosity can be enabled with one or more -v flags.
