       The locale utility shall write information about the current locale
       environment, or all public locales, to the standard output. For the
       purposes of this section, a public locale is one provided by the
       implementation that is accessible to the application.
       When locale is invoked without any arguments, it shall summarize the
       current locale environment for each locale category as determined by
       the settings of the environment variables defined in the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Chapter 7, Locale.
       When invoked with operands, it shall write values that have been
       assigned to the keywords in the locale categories, as follows:
        *  Specifying a keyword name shall select the named keyword and the
           category containing that keyword.
        *  Specifying a category name shall select the named category and
           all keywords in that category.
