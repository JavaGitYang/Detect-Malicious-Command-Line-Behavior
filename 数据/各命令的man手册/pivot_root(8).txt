       pivot_root moves the root file system of the current process to the
       directory put_old and makes new_root the new root file system.  Since
       pivot_root(8) simply calls pivot_root(2), we refer to the man page of
       the latter for further details.
       Note that, depending on the implementation of pivot_root, root and
       cwd of the caller may or may not change. The following is a sequence
       for invoking pivot_root that works in either case, assuming that
       pivot_root and chroot are in the current PATH:
       cd new_root
       pivot_root . put_old
       exec chroot . command
       Note that chroot must be available under the old root and under the
       new root, because pivot_root may or may not have implicitly changed
       the root directory of the shell.
       Note that exec chroot changes the running executable, which is
       necessary if the old root directory should be unmounted afterwards.
       Also note that standard input, output, and error may still point to a
       device on the old root file system, keeping it busy. They can easily
       be changed when invoking chroot (see below; note the absence of
       leading slashes to make it work whether pivot_root has changed the
       shell's root or not).
