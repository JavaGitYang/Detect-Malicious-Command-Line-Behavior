       lxc-monitor monitors the state of containers. The name argument may
       be used to specify which containers to monitor. It is a regular
       expression, conforming with posix2, so it is possible to monitor all
       the containers, several of them or just one. If not specified, name
       will default to '.*' which will monitor all containers in lxcpath.
       The -P, --lxcpath=PATH option may be specified multiple times to
       monitor more than one container path. Note however that containers
       with the same name in multiple paths will be indistinguishable in the
       output.
