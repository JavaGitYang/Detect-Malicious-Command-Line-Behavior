       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wctomb() function shall determine the number of bytes needed to
       represent the character corresponding to the wide-character code
       whose value is wchar (including any change in the shift state). It
       shall store the character representation (possibly multiple bytes and
       any special bytes to change shift state) in the array object pointed
       to by s (if s is not a null pointer). At most {MB_CUR_MAX} bytes
       shall be stored. If wchar is 0, a null byte shall be stored, preceded
       by any shift sequence needed to restore the initial shift state, and
       wctomb() shall be left in the initial shift state.
       The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of
       the current locale. For a state-dependent encoding, this function
       shall be placed into its initial state by a call for which its
       character pointer argument, s, is a null pointer. Subsequent calls
       with s as other than a null pointer shall cause the internal state of
       the function to be altered as necessary. A call with s as a null
       pointer shall cause this function to return a non-zero value if
       encodings have state dependency, and 0 otherwise. Changing the
       LC_CTYPE category causes the shift state of this function to be
       unspecified.
       The wctomb() function need not be thread-safe.
       The implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008 calls wctomb().
