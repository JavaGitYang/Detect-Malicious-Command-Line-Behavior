       The posix_mem_offset() function shall return in the variable pointed
       to by off a value that identifies the offset (or location), within a
       memory object, of the memory block currently mapped at addr.  The
       function shall return in the variable pointed to by fildes, the
       descriptor used (via mmap()) to establish the mapping which contains
       addr.  If that descriptor was closed since the mapping was
       established, the returned value of fildes shall be âˆ’1. The len
       argument specifies the length of the block of the memory object the
       user wishes the offset for; upon return, the value pointed to by
       contig_len shall equal either len, or the length of the largest
       contiguous block of the memory object that is currently mapped to the
       calling process starting at addr, whichever is smaller.
       If the memory object mapped at addr is a typed memory object, then if
       the off and contig_len values obtained by calling posix_mem_offset()
       are used in a call to mmap() with a file descriptor that refers to
       the same memory pool as fildes (either through the same port or
       through a different port), and that was opened with neither the
       POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE nor the POSIX_TYPED_MEM_ALLOCATE_CONTIG
       flag, the typed memory area that is mapped shall be exactly the same
       area that was mapped at addr in the address space of the process that
       called posix_mem_offset().
       If the memory object specified by fildes is not a typed memory
       object, then the behavior of this function is implementation-defined.
