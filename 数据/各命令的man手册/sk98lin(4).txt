       Note: This obsolete driver was removed from the kernel in version
       2.6.26.
       sk98lin is the Gigabit Ethernet driver for Marvell and SysKonnect
       network adapter cards.  It supports SysKonnect SK-98xx/SK-95xx
       compliant Gigabit Ethernet Adapter and any Yukon compliant chipset.
       When loading the driver using insmod, parameters for the network
       adapter cards might be stated as a sequence of comma separated
       commands.  If for instance two network adapters are installed and
       AutoNegotiation on Port A of the first adapter should be ON, but on
       the Port A of the second adapter switched OFF, one must enter:
          insmod sk98lin.o AutoNeg_A=On,Off
       After sk98lin is bound to one or more adapter cards and the /proc
       filesystem is mounted on your system, a dedicated statistics file
       will be created in the folder /proc/net/sk98lin for all ports of the
       installed network adapter cards.  Those files are named eth[x], where
       x is the number of the interface that has been assigned to a
       dedicated port by the system.
       If loading is finished, any desired IP address can be assigned to the
       respective eth[x] interface using the ifconfig(8) command.  This
       causes the adapter to connect to the Ethernet and to display a status
       message on the console saying "ethx: network connection up using port
       y" followed by the configured or detected connection parameters.
       The sk98lin also supports large frames (also called jumbo frames).
       Using jumbo frames can improve throughput tremendously when
       transferring large amounts of data.  To enable large frames, the MTU
       (maximum transfer unit) size for an interface is to be set to a high
       value.  The default MTU size is 1500 and can be changed up to 9000
       (bytes).  Setting the MTU size can be done when assigning the IP
       address to the interface or later by using the ifconfig(8) command
       with the mtu parameter.  If for instance eth0 needs an IP address and
       a large frame MTU size, the following two commands might be used:
           ifconfig eth0 10.1.1.1
           ifconfig eth0 mtu 9000
       Those two commands might even be combined into one:
           ifconfig eth0 10.1.1.1 mtu 9000
       Note that large frames can be used only if permitted by your network
       infrastructure.  This means, that any switch being used in your
       Ethernet must also support large frames.  Quite some switches support
       large frames, but need to be configured to do so.  Most of the times,
       their default setting is to support only standard frames with an MTU
       size of 1500 (bytes).  In addition to the switches inside the
       network, all network adapters that are to be used must also be
       enabled regarding jumbo frames.  If an adapter is not set to receive
       large frames, it will simply drop them.
       Switching back to the standard Ethernet frame size can be done by
       using the ifconfig(8) command again:
           ifconfig eth0 mtu 1500
       The Marvell/SysKonnect Gigabit Ethernet driver for Linux is able to
       support VLAN and Link Aggregation according to IEEE standards 802.1,
       802.1q, and 802.3ad.  Those features are available only after
       installation of open source modules which can be found on the
       Internet:
       VLAN: ⟨http://www.candelatech.com/~greear/vlan.html⟩
       Link Aggregation: ⟨http://www.st.rim.or.jp/~yumo⟩
       Note that Marvell/SysKonnect does not offer any support for these
       open source modules and does not take the responsibility for any kind
       of failures or problems arising when using these modules.
   Parameters
       Speed_A=i,j,...
              This parameter is used to set the speed capabilities of port A
              of an adapter card.  It is valid only for Yukon copper
              adapters.  Possible values are: 10, 100, 1000, or Auto; Auto
              is the default.  Usually, the speed is negotiated between the
              two ports during link establishment.  If this fails, a port
              can be forced to a specific setting with this parameter.
       Speed_B=i,j,...
              This parameter is used to set the speed capabilities of port B
              of an adapter card.  It is valid only for Yukon copper
              adapters.  Possible values are: 10, 100, 1000, or Auto; Auto
              is the default.  Usually, the speed is negotiated between the
              two ports during link establishment.  If this fails, a port
              can be forced to a specific setting with this parameter.
       AutoNeg_A=i,j,...
              Enables or disables the use of autonegotiation of port A of an
              adapter card.  Possible values are: On, Off, or Sense; On is
              the default.  The Sense mode automatically detects whether the
              link partner supports auto-negotiation or not.
       AutoNeg_B=i,j,...
              Enables or disables the use of autonegotiation of port B of an
              adapter card.  Possible values are: On, Off, or Sense; On is
              the default.  The Sense mode automatically detects whether the
              link partner supports auto-negotiation or not.
       DupCap_A=i,j,...
              This parameter indicates the duplex mode to be used for port A
              of an adapter card.  Possible values are: Half, Full, or Both;
              Both is the default.  This parameter is relevant only if
              AutoNeg_A of port A is not set to Sense.  If AutoNeg_A is set
              to On, all three values of DupCap_A ( Half, Full or Both)
              might be stated.  If AutoNeg_A is set to Off, only DupCap_A
              values Full and Half are allowed.  This DupCap_A parameter is
              useful if your link partner does not support all possible
              duplex combinations.
       DupCap_B=i,j,...
              This parameter indicates the duplex mode to be used for port B
              of an adapter card.  Possible values are: Half, Full, or Both;
              Both is the default.  This parameter is relevant only if
              AutoNeg_B of port B is not set to Sense.  If AutoNeg_B is set
              to On, all three values of DupCap_B ( Half, Full or Both)
              might be stated.  If AutoNeg_B is set to Off, only DupCap_B
              values Full and Half are allowed.  This DupCap_B parameter is
              useful if your link partner does not support all possible
              duplex combinations.
       FlowCtrl_A=i,j,...
              This parameter can be used to set the flow control capabili‐
              ties the port reports during auto-negotiation.  Possible val‐
              ues are: Sym, SymOrRem, LocSend, or None; SymOrRem is the
              default.  The different modes have the following meaning:
              Sym = Symmetric
               both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames
              SymOrRem = SymmetricOrRemote
               both or only remote partner are allowed to send PAUSE frames
              LocSend = LocalSend
               only local link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
              None = None
               no link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
              Note that this parameter is ignored if AutoNeg_A is set to
              Off.
       FlowCtrl_B=i,j,...
              This parameter can be used to set the flow control capabili‐
              ties the port reports during auto-negotiation.  Possible val‐
              ues are: Sym, SymOrRem, LocSend, or None; SymOrRem is the
              default.  The different modes have the following meaning:
              Sym = Symmetric
               both link partners are allowed to send PAUSE frames
              SymOrRem = SymmetricOrRemote
               both or only remote partner are allowed to send PAUSE frames
              LocSend = LocalSend
               only local link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
              None = None
               no link partner is allowed to send PAUSE frames
              Note that this parameter is ignored if AutoNeg_B is set to
              Off.
       Role_A=i,j,...
              This parameter is valid only for 1000Base-T adapter cards.
              For two 1000Base-T ports to communicate, one must take the
              role of the master (providing timing information), while the
              other must be the slave.  Possible values are: Auto, Master,
              or Slave; Auto is the default.  Usually, the role of a port is
              negotiated between two ports during link establishment, but if
              that fails the port A of an adapter card can be forced to a
              specific setting with this parameter.
       Role_B=i,j,...
              This parameter is valid only for 1000Base-T adapter cards.
              For two 1000Base-T ports to communicate, one must take the
              role of the master (providing timing information), while the
              other must be the slave.  Possible values are: Auto, Master,
              or Slave; Auto is the default.  Usually, the role of a port is
              negotiated between two ports during link establishment, but if
              that fails the port B of an adapter card can be forced to a
              specific setting with this parameter.
       ConType=i,j,...
              This parameter is a combination of all five per-port parame‐
              ters within one single parameter.  This simplifies the config‐
              uration of both ports of an adapter card.  The different val‐
              ues of this variable reflect the most meaningful combinations
              of port parameters.  Possible values and their corresponding
              combination of per-port parameters:
              ConType | DupCap   AutoNeg   FlowCtrl   Role   Speed
              --------+-------------------------------------------
              Auto    |  Both      On      SymOrRem   Auto   Auto
              100FD   |  Full      Off       None     Auto   100
              100HD   |  Half      Off       None     Auto   100
              10FD    |  Full      Off       None     Auto   10
              10HD    |  Half      Off       None     Auto   10
              Stating any other port parameter together with this ConType
              parameter will result in a merged configuration of those set‐
              tings.  This is due to the fact, that the per-port parameters
              (e.g., Speed_A) have a higher priority than the combined vari‐
              able ConType.
       Moderation=i,j,...
              Interrupt moderation is employed to limit the maximum number
              of interrupts the driver has to serve.  That is, one or more
              interrupts (which indicate any transmit or receive packet to
              be processed) are queued until the driver processes them.
              When queued interrupts are to be served, is determined by the
              IntsPerSec parameter, which is explained later below.  Possi‐
              ble moderation modes are: None, Static, or Dynamic; None is
              the default.  The different modes have the following meaning:
              None No interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter card.
              Therefore, each transmit or receive interrupt is served imme‐
              diately as soon as it appears on the interrupt line of the
              adapter card.
              Static Interrupt moderation is applied on the adapter card.
              All transmit and receive interrupts are queued until a com‐
              plete moderation interval ends.  If such a moderation interval
              ends, all queued interrupts are processed in one big bunch
              without any delay.  The term Static reflects the fact, that
              interrupt moderation is always enabled, regardless how much
              network load is currently passing via a particular interface.
              In addition, the duration of the moderation interval has a
              fixed length that never changes while the driver is opera‐
              tional.
              Dynamic Interrupt moderation might be applied on the adapter
              card, depending on the load of the system.  If the driver
              detects that the system load is too high, the driver tries to
              shield the system against too much network load by enabling
              interrupt moderation.  If—at a later time—the CPU utilization
              decreases again (or if the network load is negligible), the
              interrupt moderation will automatically be disabled.
              Interrupt moderation should be used when the driver has to
              handle one or more interfaces with a high network load, which—
              as a consequence—leads also to a high CPU utilization.  When
              moderation is applied in such high network load situations,
              CPU load might be reduced by 20–30% on slow computers.
              Note that the drawback of using interrupt moderation is an
              increase of the round-trip-time (RTT), due to the queuing and
              serving of interrupts at dedicated moderation times.
       IntsPerSec=i,j,...
              This parameter determines the length of any interrupt modera‐
              tion interval.  Assuming that static interrupt moderation is
              to be used, an IntsPerSec parameter value of 2000 will lead to
              an interrupt moderation interval of 500 microseconds.  Possi‐
              ble values for this parameter are in the range of 30...40000
              (interrupts per second).  The default value is 2000.
              This parameter is used only if either static or dynamic inter‐
              rupt moderation is enabled on a network adapter card.  This
              parameter is ignored if no moderation is applied.
              Note that the duration of the moderation interval is to be
              chosen with care.  At first glance, selecting a very long
              duration (e.g., only 100 interrupts per second) seems to be
              meaningful, but the increase of packet-processing delay is
              tremendous.  On the other hand, selecting a very short modera‐
              tion time might compensate the use of any moderation being
              applied.
       PrefPort=i,j,...
              This parameter is used to force the preferred port to A or B
              (on dual-port network adapters).  The preferred port is the
              one that is used if both ports A and B are detected as fully
              functional.  Possible values are: A or B; A is the default.
       RlmtMode=i,j,...
              RLMT monitors the status of the port.  If the link of the
              active port fails, RLMT switches immediately to the standby
              link.  The virtual link is maintained as long as at least one
              "physical" link is up.  This parameters states how RLMT should
              monitor both ports.  Possible values are: CheckLinkState,
              CheckLocalPort, CheckSeg, or DualNet; CheckLinkState is the
              default.  The different modes have the following meaning:
              CheckLinkState Check link state only: RLMT uses the link state
              reported by the adapter hardware for each individual port to
              determine whether a port can be used for all network traffic
              or not.
              CheckLocalPort In this mode, RLMT monitors the network path
              between the two ports of an adapter by regularly exchanging
              packets between them.  This mode requires a network configura‐
              tion in which the two ports are able to "see" each other
              (i.e., there must not be any router between the ports).
              CheckSeg Check local port and segmentation: This mode supports
              the same functions as the CheckLocalPort mode and additionally
              checks network segmentation between the ports.  Therefore,
              this mode is to be used only if Gigabit Ethernet switches are
              installed on the network that have been configured to use the
              Spanning Tree protocol.
              DualNet In this mode, ports A and B are used as separate
              devices.  If you have a dual port adapter, port A will be con‐
              figured as eth[x] and port B as eth[x+1].  Both ports can be
              used independently with distinct IP addresses.  The preferred
              port setting is not used.  RLMT is turned off.
              Note that RLMT modes CheckLocalPort and CheckLinkState are
              designed to operate in configurations where a network path
              between the ports on one adapter exists.  Moreover, they are
              not designed to work where adapters are connected back-to-
              back.
