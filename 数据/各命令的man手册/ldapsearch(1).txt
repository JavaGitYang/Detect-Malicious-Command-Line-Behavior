       ldapsearch is a shell-accessible interface to the ldap_search_ext(3)
       library call.
       ldapsearch opens a connection to an LDAP server, binds, and performs
       a search using specified parameters.   The filter should conform to
       the string representation for search filters as defined in RFC 4515.
       If not provided, the default filter, (objectClass=*), is used.
       If ldapsearch finds one or more entries, the attributes specified by
       attrs are returned.  If * is listed, all user attributes are
       returned.  If + is listed, all operational attributes are returned.
       If no attrs are listed, all user attributes are returned.  If only
       1.1 is listed, no attributes will be returned.
       The search results are displayed using an extended version of LDIF.
       Option -L controls the format of the output.
