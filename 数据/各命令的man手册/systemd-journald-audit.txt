       systemd-journald is a system service that collects and stores logging
       data. It creates and maintains structured, indexed journals based on
       logging information that is received from a variety of sources:
       ·   Kernel log messages, via kmsg
       ·   Simple system log messages, via the libc syslog(3) call
       ·   Structured system log messages via the native Journal API, see
           sd_journal_print(4)
       ·   Standard output and standard error of system services
       ·   Audit records, via the audit subsystem
       The daemon will implicitly collect numerous metadata fields for each
       log messages in a secure and unfakeable way. See
       systemd.journal-fields(7) for more information about the collected
       metadata.
       Log data collected by the journal is primarily text-based but can
       also include binary data where necessary. All objects stored in the
       journal can be up to 2^64-1 bytes in size.
       By default, the journal stores log data in /run/log/journal/. Since
       /run/ is volatile, log data is lost at reboot. To make the data
       persistent, it is sufficient to create /var/log/journal/ where
       systemd-journald will then store the data:
           mkdir -p /var/log/journal
           systemd-tmpfiles --create --prefix /var/log/journal
       See journald.conf(5) for information about the configuration of this
       service.
