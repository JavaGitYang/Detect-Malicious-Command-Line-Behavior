       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish

       The git-mergetool--lib scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .)
       by other shell scripts to set up functions for working with Git merge
       tools.
       Before sourcing git-mergetool--lib, your script must set TOOL_MODE to
       define the operation mode for the functions listed below. diff and
       merge are valid values.
