       The posix_madvise() function allows an application to advise the
       system about its expected patterns of usage of memory in the address
       range starting at addr and continuing for len bytes.  The system is
       free to use this advice in order to improve the performance of memory
       accesses (or to ignore the advice altogether), but calling
       posix_madvise() shall not affect the semantics of access to memory in
       the specified range.
       The advice argument is one of the following:
       POSIX_MADV_NORMAL
              The application has no special advice regarding its memory
              usage patterns for the specified address range.  This is the
              default behavior.
       POSIX_MADV_SEQUENTIAL
              The application expects to access the specified address range
              sequentially, running from lower addresses to higher
              addresses.  Hence, pages in this region can be aggressively
              read ahead, and may be freed soon after they are accessed.
       POSIX_MADV_RANDOM
              The application expects to access the specified address range
              randomly.  Thus, read ahead may be less useful than normally.
       POSIX_MADV_WILLNEED
              The application expects to access the specified address range
              in the near future.  Thus, read ahead may be beneficial.
       POSIX_MADV_DONTNEED
              The application expects that it will not access the specified
              address range in the near future.
