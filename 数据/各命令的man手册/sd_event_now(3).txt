       sd_event_now() returns the time when the most recent event loop
       iteration began. A timestamp is taken right after returning from the
       event sleep, and before dispatching any event sources. The event
       parameter specifies the event loop object to retrieve the timestamp
       from. The clock parameter specifies the clock to retrieve the
       timestamp for, and is one of CLOCK_REALTIME (or equivalently
       CLOCK_REALTIME_ALARM), CLOCK_MONOTONIC, or CLOCK_BOOTTIME (or
       equivalently CLOCK_BOOTTIME_ALARM), see clock_gettime(2) for more
       information on the various clocks. The retrieved timestamp is stored
       in the usec parameter, in Âµs since the clock's epoch. If this
       function is invoked before the first event loop iteration, the
       current time is returned, as reported by clock_gettime(). To
       distinguish this case from a regular invocation the return value will
       be positive, and zero when the returned timestamp refers to an actual
       event loop iteration.
