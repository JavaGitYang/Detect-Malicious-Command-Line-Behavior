       The Dynamic Group overlay allows clients to use LDAP Compare
       operations to test the membership of a dynamic group the same way
       they would check against a static group. Compare operations targeting
       a group's static member attribute will be intercepted and tested
       against the configured dynamic group's URL attribute.
       Note that this intercept only happens if the actual Compare operation
       does not return a LDAP_COMPARE_TRUE result. So if a group has both
       static and dynamic members, the static member list will be checked
       first.
