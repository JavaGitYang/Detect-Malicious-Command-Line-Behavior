       These functions shall return the exponent part of their argument x.
       Formally, the return value is the integral part of $log sub{r}|x|$ as
       a signed integral value, for non-zero x, where r is the radix of the
       machine's floating-point arithmetic, which is the value of FLT_RADIX
       defined in <float.h>.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before calling these
       functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or fetestexcept(FE_INVALID
       | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW | FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error
       has occurred.
