       The iconv_open() function allocates a conversion descriptor suitable
       for converting byte sequences from character encoding fromcode to
       character encoding tocode.
       The values permitted for fromcode and tocode and the supported
       combinations are system-dependent.  For the GNU C library, the
       permitted values are listed by the iconv --list command, and all
       combinations of the listed values are supported.  Furthermore the GNU
       C library and the GNU libiconv library support the following two
       suffixes:
       //TRANSLIT
              When the string "//TRANSLIT" is appended to tocode,
              transliteration is activated.  This means that when a
              character cannot be represented in the target character set,
              it can be approximated through one or several similarly
              looking characters.
       //IGNORE
              When the string "//IGNORE" is appended to tocode, characters
              that cannot be represented in the target character set will be
              silently discarded.
       The resulting conversion descriptor can be used with iconv(3) any
       number of times.  It remains valid until deallocated using
       iconv_close(3).
       A conversion descriptor contains a conversion state.  After creation
       using iconv_open(), the state is in the initial state.  Using
       iconv(3) modifies the descriptor's conversion state.  To bring the
       state back to the initial state, use iconv(3) with NULL as inbuf
       argument.
