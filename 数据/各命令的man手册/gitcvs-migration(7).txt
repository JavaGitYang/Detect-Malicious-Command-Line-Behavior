       Git differs from CVS in that every working tree contains a repository
       with a full copy of the project history, and no repository is
       inherently more important than any other. However, you can emulate
       the CVS model by designating a single shared repository which people
       can synchronize with; this document explains how to do that.
       Some basic familiarity with Git is required. Having gone through
       gittutorial(7) and gitglossary(7) should be sufficient.
