       Store  err in the session-specific errno variable.  Useful values for
       err are EINTR, EAGAIN and EMSGSIZE, other values are treated will be
       treated as real errors in the push/pull function.
       This function is useful in replacement push and pull functions set by
       gnutls_transport_set_push_function() and
       gnutls_transport_set_pull_function() under Windows, where the
       replacements may not have access to the same  errno variable that is
       used by GnuTLS (e.g., the application is linked to msvcr71.dll and
       gnutls is linked to msvcrt.dll).
