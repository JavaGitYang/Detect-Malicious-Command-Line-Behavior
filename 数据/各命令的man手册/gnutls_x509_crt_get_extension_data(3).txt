       This function will return the requested extension data in the
       certificate.  The extension data will be stored in the provided
       buffer.
       Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_info() to extract the OID and
       critical flag.  Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_extension_by_oid() instead,
       if you want to get data indexed by the extension OID rather than
       sequence.
