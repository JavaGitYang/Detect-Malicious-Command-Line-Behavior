       Usually you would want to use git fetch, which is a higher level
       wrapper of this command, instead.
       Invokes git-upload-pack on a possibly remote repository and asks it
       to send objects missing from this repository, to update the named
       heads. The list of commits available locally is found out by scanning
       the local refs/ hierarchy and sent to git-upload-pack running on the
       other end.
       This command degenerates to download everything to complete the asked
       refs from the remote side when the local side does not have a common
       ancestor commit.
