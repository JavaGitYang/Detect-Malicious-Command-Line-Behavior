       Slapd is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP connections
       on any number of ports (default 389), responding to the LDAP
       operations it receives over these connections.  slapd is typically
       invoked at boot time, usually out of /etc/rc.local.  Upon startup,
       slapd normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
       If configured in the config file (or config directory), the slapd
       process will print its process ID (see getpid(2)) to a .pid file, as
       well as the command line options during invocation to an .args file
       (see slapd.conf(5)).  If the -d flag is given, even with a zero
       argument, slapd will not fork and disassociate from the invoking tty.
       See the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on slapd.
