       ipptool sends IPP requests to the specified printer-uri and tests
       and/or displays the results.  Each named testfile defines one or more
       requests, including the expected response status, attributes, and
       values.  Output is either a plain text, formatted text, CSV, or XML
       report on the standard output, with a non-zero exit status indicating
       that one or more tests have failed.  The testfile format is described
       in ipptoolfile(5).
