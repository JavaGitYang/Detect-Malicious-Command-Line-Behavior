       sulogin is invoked by init when the system goes into single-user
       mode.
       The user is prompted:
            Give root password for system maintenance
            (or type Control-D for normal startup):
       If the root account is locked and --force is specified, no password
       is required.
       sulogin will be connected to the current terminal, or to the optional
       tty device that can be specified on the command line (typically
       /dev/console).
       When the user exits from the single-user shell, or presses control-D
       at the prompt, the system will continue to boot.
