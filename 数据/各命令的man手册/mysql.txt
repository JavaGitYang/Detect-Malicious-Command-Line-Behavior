       MariaDB distributions on Unix include a script named mysql.server. It
       can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris that use System
       V-style run directories to start and stop system services. It is also
       used by the Mac OS X Startup Item for MariaDB.
       mysql.server can be found in the support-files directory under your
       MariaDB installation directory or in a MariaDB source distribution.
       If you use the Linux server RPM package (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm),
       the mysql.server script will be installed in the /etc/init.d
       directory with the name mysql. You need not install it manually.
       Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script under
       a different name such as mysqld.
       If you install MariaDB from a source distribution or using a binary
       distribution format that does not install mysql.server automatically,
       you can install it manually.
       mysql.server reads options from the [mysql.server] and [mysqld]
       sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also reads
       [mysql_server] sections, although you should rename such sections to
       [mysql.server]&.
       mysql.server supports the following options.
       ·   --basedir=path
           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.
       ·   --datadir=path
           The path to the MariaDB data directory.
       ·   --pid-file=file_name
           The path name of the file in which the server should write its
           process ID. If not provided, the default, "host_name.pid" is
           used.
       ·   --service-startup-timeout=file_name
           How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server startup.
           If the server does not start within this time, mysql.server exits
           with an error. The default value is 900. A value of 0 means not
           to wait at all for startup. Negative values mean to wait forever
           (no timeout).
       ·   --use-mysqld_safe
           Use mysqld_safe to start the server. This is the default.
       ·   --use-manager
           Use Instance Manager to start the server.
       ·   --user=user_name
           The login user name to use for running mysqld.
