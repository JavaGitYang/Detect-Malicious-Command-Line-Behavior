       The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream.  The new position, measured in bytes, is
       obtained by adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence.
       If whence is set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is
       relative to the start of the file, the current position indicator, or
       end-of-file, respectively.  A successful call to the fseek() function
       clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any
       effects of the ungetc(3) function on the same stream.
       The ftell() function obtains the current value of the file position
       indicator for the stream pointed to by stream.
       The rewind() function sets the file position indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream to the beginning of the file.  It is equivalent
       to:
              (void) fseek(stream, 0L, SEEK_SET)
       except that the error indicator for the stream is also cleared (see
       clearerr(3)).
       The fgetpos() and fsetpos() functions are alternate interfaces
       equivalent to ftell() and fseek() (with whence set to SEEK_SET),
       setting and storing the current value of the file offset into or from
       the object referenced by pos.  On some non-UNIX systems, an fpos_t
       object may be a complex object and these routines may be the only way
       to portably reposition a text stream.
