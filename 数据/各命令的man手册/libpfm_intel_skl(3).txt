       The library supports the Intel SkyLake core PMU. It should be noted
       that this PMU model only covers each core's PMU and not the socket
       level PMU.
       On SkyLake, the number of generic counters depends on the
       Hyperthreading (HT) mode.
       counters are available. The pfm_get_pmu_info() function returns the
       maximum number of generic counters in num_cntrs.
