       This remote helper uses the specified <command> to connect to a
       remote Git server.
       Data written to stdin of the specified <command> is assumed to be
       sent to a git:// server, git-upload-pack, git-receive-pack or
       git-upload-archive (depending on situation), and data read from
       stdout of <command> is assumed to be received from the same service.
       Command and arguments are separated by an unescaped space.
       The following sequences have a special meaning:
       '% '
           Literal space in command or argument.
       %%
           Literal percent sign.
       %s
           Replaced with name (receive-pack, upload-pack, or upload-archive)
           of the service Git wants to invoke.
       %S
           Replaced with long name (git-receive-pack, git-upload-pack, or
           git-upload-archive) of the service Git wants to invoke.
       %G (must be the first characters in an argument)
           This argument will not be passed to <command>. Instead, it will
           cause the helper to start by sending git:// service requests to
           the remote side with the service field set to an appropriate
           value and the repository field set to rest of the argument.
           Default is not to send such a request.
           This is useful if remote side is git:// server accessed over some
           tunnel.
       %V (must be first characters in argument)
           This argument will not be passed to <command>. Instead it sets
           the vhost field in the git:// service request (to rest of the
           argument). Default is not to send vhost in such request (if
           sent).
