       The trace-cmd(1) record command will set up the Ftrace Linux kernel
       tracer to record the specified plugins or events that happen while
       the command executes. If no command is given, then it will record
       until the user hits Ctrl-C.
       The record command of trace-cmd will set up the Ftrace tracer to
       start tracing the various events or plugins that are given on the
       command line. It will then create a number of tracing processes (one
       per CPU) that will start recording from the kernel ring buffer
       straight into temporary files. When the command is complete (or
       Ctrl-C is hit) all the files will be combined into a trace.dat file
       that can later be read (see trace-cmd-report(1)).
