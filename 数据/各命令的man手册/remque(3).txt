       The insque() and remque() functions manipulate doubly-linked lists.
       Each element in the list is a structure of which the first two
       elements are a forward and a backward pointer.  The linked list may
       be linear (i.e., NULL forward pointer at the end of the list and NULL
       backward pointer at the start of the list) or circular.
       The insque() function inserts the element pointed to by elem
       immediately after the element pointed to by prev.
       If the list is linear, then the call insque(elem, NULL) can be used
       to insert the initial list element, and the call sets the forward and
       backward pointers of elem to NULL.
       If the list is circular, the caller should ensure that the forward
       and backward pointers of the first element are initialized to point
       to that element, and the prev argument of the insque() call should
       also point to the element.
       The remque() function removes the element pointed to by elem from the
       doubly-linked list.
