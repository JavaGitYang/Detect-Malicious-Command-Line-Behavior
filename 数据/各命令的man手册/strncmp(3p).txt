       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described

       The strncmp() function shall compare not more than n bytes (bytes
       that follow a NUL character are not compared) from the array pointed
       to by s1 to the array pointed to by s2.
       The sign of a non-zero return value is determined by the sign of the
       difference between the values of the first pair of bytes (both
       interpreted as type unsigned char) that differ in the strings being
       compared.
