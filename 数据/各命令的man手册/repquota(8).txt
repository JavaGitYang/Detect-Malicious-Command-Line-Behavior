       repquota prints a summary of the disc usage and quotas for the
       specified file systems.  For each user the current number of files
       and amount of space (in kilobytes) is printed, along with any quota
       limits set with edquota(8) or setquota(8).  In the second column
       repquota prints two characters marking which limits are exceeded. If
       user is over his space softlimit or reaches his space hardlimit in
       case softlimit is unset, the first character is '+'. Otherwise the
       character printed is '-'. The second character denotes the state of
       inode usage analogously.
       repquota has to translate ids of all users/groups/projects to names
       (unless option -n was specified) so it may take a while to print all
       the information. To make translating as fast as possible repquota
       tries to detect (by reading /etc/nsswitch.conf) whether entries are
       stored in standard plain text file or in a database and either
       translates chunks of 1024 names or each name individually. You can
       override this autodetection by -c or -C options.
