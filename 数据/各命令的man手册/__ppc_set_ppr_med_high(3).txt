       These functions provide access to the Program Priority Register (PPR)
       on the Power architecture.
       The PPR is a 64-bit register that controls the program's priority.
       By adjusting the PPR value the programmer may improve system
       throughput by causing system resources to be used more efficiently,
       especially in contention situations.  The available unprivileged
       states are covered by the following functions:
       *  __ppc_set_ppr_med() sets the Program Priority Register value to
          medium (default).
       *  __ppc_set_ppr_very_low() sets the Program Priority Register value
          to very low.
       *  __ppc_set_ppr_low() sets the Program Priority Register value to
          low.
       *  __ppc_set_ppr_med_low() sets the Program Priority Register value
          to medium low.
       The privileged state medium high may also be set during certain time
       intervals by problem-state (unprivileged) programs, with the
       following function:
       *  __ppc_set_ppr_med_high() sets the Program Priority to medium high.
       If the program priority is medium high when the time interval expires
       or if an attempt is made to set the priority to medium high when it
       is not allowed, the priority is set to medium.
