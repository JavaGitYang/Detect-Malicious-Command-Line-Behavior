       The pthread_setschedprio() function shall set the scheduling priority
       for the thread whose thread ID is given by thread to the value given
       by prio.  See Scheduling Policies for a description on how this
       function call affects the ordering of the thread in the thread list
       for its new priority.
       If the pthread_setschedprio() function fails, the scheduling priority
       of the target thread shall not be changed.
