       start-stop-daemon is used to control the creation and termination of
       system-level processes.  Using one of the matching options,
       start-stop-daemon can be configured to find existing instances of a
       running process.
       Note: unless --pid or --pidfile are specified, start-stop-daemon
       behaves similar to killall(1).  start-stop-daemon will scan the
       process table looking for any processes which match the process name,
       parent pid, uid, and/or gid (if specified). Any matching process will
       prevent --start from starting the daemon. All matching processes will
       be sent the TERM signal (or the one specified via --signal or
       --retry) if --stop is specified. For daemons which have long-lived
       children which need to live through a --stop, you must specify a
       pidfile.
