       The Linux Trace Toolkit: next generation <http://lttng.org/> is an
       open source software package used for correlated tracing of the Linux
       kernel, user applications, and user libraries.
       LTTng consists of Linux kernel modules (for Linux kernel tracing) and
       dynamically loaded libraries (for user application and library
       tracing).
       The LTTng relay daemon is responsible for receiving trace data from
       possibly remote LTTng session/consumer daemons and for writing it to
       the local file system. The relay daemon also accepts LTTng live
       connections from compatible viewers; this is the official approach to
       viewing LTTng events as they are emitted.
       The relay daemon listens by default on all network interfaces to
       gather trace data, but only on localhost for LTTng live connections.
       The relay daemon does not require any particular permissions, as long
       as it can write to the output directory and listen on the configured
       ports. If a user is within a secured network and/or has proper
       firewall settings, lttng-relayd can listen to LTTng live connections
       from all network interfaces by specifying --live-
       port=tcp://localhost:5344.
       Once a trace has been streamed completely, the trace can be processed
       by any tool that can process an LTTng trace located on the local file
       system.
   Output directory
       By default, the relay daemon writes the traces to:
           $LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces/HOSTNAME/SESSION/DOMAIN
       with:
       HOSTNAME
           Remote hostname.
       SESSION
           Full session name.
       DOMAIN
           Tracing domain.
       You can override the default output directory prefix
       ($LTTNG_HOME/lttng-traces) with the --output option. The other parts
       depend on the remote configuration.
   URL format
       The --control-port, --data-port, and --live-port options specify
       URLs.
       The format of those URLs is:
           tcp://(HOST | IPADDR):PORT
       with:
       (HOST | IPADDR)
           Binding hostname or IP address (IPv6 address must be enclosed in
           brackets ([ and ]); see RFC 2732
           <https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt>).
       PORT
           TCP port.
