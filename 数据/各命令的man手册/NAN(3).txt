       These functions return a representation (determined by tagp) of a
       quiet NaN.  If the implementation does not support quiet NaNs, these
       functions return zero.
       The call nan("char-sequence") is equivalent to:
           strtod("NAN(char-sequence)", NULL);
       Similarly, calls to nanf() and nanl() are equivalent to analogous
       calls to strtof(3) and strtold(3).
       The argument tagp is used in an unspecified manner.  On IEEE 754 sys‚Äê
       tems, there are many representations of NaN, and tagp selects one.
       On other systems it may do nothing.
