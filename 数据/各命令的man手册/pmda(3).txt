       To assist in the development of Performance Metric Domain Agents
       (PMDAs) for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP), a procedural interface is
       provided that extends the Performance Metrics Application Programming
       Interface ( PMAPI(3)) library.  These procedures are designed to
       enable a programmer to quickly build a PMDA which can then be tested
       and refined.  However, this also implies that a PMDA has a particular
       structure which may not be suitable for all PMDA implementations.
       Once you are familiar with the PCP and PMDA frameworks, you can
       quickly implement a new PMDA with only a few data structures and
       functions.  This is covered in far greater detail in the Performance
       Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide.
       A PMDA is responsible for a set of performance metrics, in the sense
       that it must respond to requests from pmcd(1) for information about
       performance metrics, instance domains, and instantiated values.
       This man page contains sections of the simple PMDA which is located
       at $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/simple.
