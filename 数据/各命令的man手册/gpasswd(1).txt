       The gpasswd command is used to administer /etc/group, and
       /etc/gshadow. Every group can have administrators, members and a
       password.
       System administrators can use the -A option to define group
       administrator(s) and the -M option to define members. They have all
       rights of group administrators and members.
       gpasswd called by a group administrator with a group name only
       prompts for the new password of the group.
       If a password is set the members can still use newgrp(1) without a
       password, and non-members must supply the password.
   Notes about group passwords
       Group passwords are an inherent security problem since more than one
       person is permitted to know the password. However, groups are a
       useful tool for permitting co-operation between different users.
