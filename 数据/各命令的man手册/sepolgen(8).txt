       Use sepolicy generate to generate an SELinux policy Module.
       sepolicy generate will create 5 files.
       When specifying a confined application you must specify a path.
       sepolicy generate will use the rpm payload of the application along
       with nm -D APPLICATION to help it generate types and policy rules for
       your policy files.
       Type Enforcing File NAME.te
       This file can be used to define all the types rules for a particular
       domain.
       Note: Policy generated by sepolicy generate will automatically add a
       permissive DOMAIN to your te file.  When you are satisfied that your
       policy works, you need to remove the permissive line from the te file
       to run your domain in enforcing mode.
       Interface File NAME.if
       This file defines the interfaces for the types generated in the te
       file, which can be used by other policy domains.
       File Context NAME.fc
       This file defines the default file context for the system, it takes
       the file types created in the te file and associates file paths to
       the types.  Tools like restorecon and RPM will use these paths to put
       down labels.
       RPM Spec File NAME_selinux.spec
       This file is an RPM SPEC file that can be used to install the SELinux
       policy on to machines and setup the labeling. The spec file also
       installs the interface file and a man page describing the policy.
       You can use sepolicy manpage -d NAME to generate the man page.
       Shell File NAME.sh
       This is a helper shell script to compile, install and fix the
       labeling on your test system.  It will also generate a man page based
       on the installed policy, and compile and build an RPM suitable to be
       installed on other machines
       If a generate is possible, this tool will print out all generate
       paths from the source domain to the target domain
