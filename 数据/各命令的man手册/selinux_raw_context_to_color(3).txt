       selinux_raw_context_to_color() returns a color_str associated to the
       raw context raw provided that the mcstransd(8) daemon is running, the
       policy is an MLS type policy (MCS or MLS) and there is a color
       configuration file secolor.conf(5) (see the FILES section).
       The color_str string is a space separated list of eight hexadecimal
       RGB triples, each prefixed by a hash character (#). These represent
       the user:role:type:range components of the foreground and background
       colors. An example string is shown in the EXAMPLE section.
       The returned color_str string must be freed with free(3).
       If a color has not been configured for a specific user, role, type
       and/or range component of context raw, then
       selinux_raw_context_to_color() will select the color returned in
       color_str in order of precedence as follows:
              role, type, range
              user, type, range
              user, role, range
              user, role, type
       If there are no entries in the secolor.conf(5) file for any of the
       components of context raw (or the file is not present), then the
       default string returned in color_str is:
              ----- user ---- ---- role ----  ---- type ----  ---- range
              ----
              #000000 #ffffff #000000 #ffffff #000000 #ffffff #000000
              #ffffff
