       The ptsname() function returns the name of the slave pseudoterminal
       device corresponding to the master referred to by fd.
       The ptsname_r() function is the reentrant equivalent of ptsname().
       It returns the name of the slave pseudoterminal device as a null-
       terminated string in the buffer pointed to by buf.  The buflen
       argument specifies the number of bytes available in buf.
