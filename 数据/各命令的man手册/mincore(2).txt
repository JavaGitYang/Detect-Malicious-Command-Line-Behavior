       mincore() returns a vector that indicates whether pages of the
       calling process's virtual memory are resident in core (RAM), and so
       will not cause a disk access (page fault) if referenced.  The kernel
       returns residency information about the pages starting at the address
       addr, and continuing for length bytes.
       The addr argument must be a multiple of the system page size.  The
       length argument need not be a multiple of the page size, but since
       residency information is returned for whole pages, length is
       effectively rounded up to the next multiple of the page size.  One
       may obtain the page size (PAGE_SIZE) using sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE).
       The vec argument must point to an array containing at least
       (length+PAGE_SIZE-1) / PAGE_SIZE bytes.  On return, the least
       significant bit of each byte will be set if the corresponding page is
       currently resident in memory, and be clear otherwise.  (The settings
       of the other bits in each byte are undefined; these bits are reserved
       for possible later use.)  Of course the information returned in vec
       is only a snapshot: pages that are not locked in memory can come and
       go at any moment, and the contents of vec may already be stale by the
       time this call returns.
