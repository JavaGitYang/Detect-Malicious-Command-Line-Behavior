       auditd is the userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It's
       responsible for writing audit records to the disk. Viewing the logs
       is done with the ausearch or aureport utilities. Configuring the
       audit system or loading rules is done with the auditctl utility.
       During startup, the rules in /etc/audit/audit.rules are read by
       auditctl and loaded into the kernel. Alternately, there is also an
       augenrules program that reads rules located in /etc/audit/rules.d/
       and compiles them into an audit.rules file. The audit daemon itself
       has some configuration options that the admin may wish to customize.
       They are found in the auditd.conf file.
