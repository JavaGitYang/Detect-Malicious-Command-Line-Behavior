       Nmap (“Network Mapper”) is an open source tool for network
       exploration and security auditing. It was designed to rapidly scan
       large networks, although it works fine against single hosts. Nmap
       uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are
       available on the network, what services (application name and
       version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS
       versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are
       in use, and dozens of other characteristics. While Nmap is commonly
       used for security audits, many systems and network administrators
       find it useful for routine tasks such as network inventory, managing
       service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime.
       The output from Nmap is a list of scanned targets, with supplemental
       information on each depending on the options used. Key among that
       information is the “interesting ports table”.  That table lists the
       port number and protocol, service name, and state. The state is
       either open, filtered, closed, or unfiltered.  Open means that an
       application on the target machine is listening for
       connections/packets on that port.  Filtered means that a firewall,
       filter, or other network obstacle is blocking the port so that Nmap
       cannot tell whether it is open or closed.  Closed ports have no
       application listening on them, though they could open up at any time.
       Ports are classified as unfiltered when they are responsive to Nmap's
       probes, but Nmap cannot determine whether they are open or closed.
       Nmap reports the state combinations open|filtered and closed|filtered
       when it cannot determine which of the two states describe a port. The
       port table may also include software version details when version
       detection has been requested. When an IP protocol scan is requested
       (-sO), Nmap provides information on supported IP protocols rather
       than listening ports.
       In addition to the interesting ports table, Nmap can provide further
       information on targets, including reverse DNS names, operating system
       guesses, device types, and MAC addresses.
       A typical Nmap scan is shown in Example 1. The only Nmap arguments
       used in this example are -A, to enable OS and version detection,
       script scanning, and traceroute; -T4 for faster execution; and then
       the hostname.
       Example 1. A representative Nmap scan
           # nmap -A -T4 scanme.nmap.org
