       This command resolves both system call names and numbers with respect
       to the given architecture supplied in the optional ARCH argument.  If
       the architecture is not supplied on the command line then the native
       architecture is used.  If the "-t" argument is specified along with a
       system call name, then the system call will be translated as
       necessary for the given architecture.  The "-t" argument has no
       effect if a system call number is specified.
       In some combinations of architecture and system call, a negative
       system call number will be displayed.  A negative system call number
       indicates that the system call is not defined for the given
       architecture and is treated in a special manner by libseccomp
       depending on the operation.
       -a ARCH
              The architecture to use for resolving the system call.  Valid
              ARCH values are "x86", "x86_64", "x32", and "arm".
       -t     If necessary, translate the system call name to the proper
              system call number, even if the system call name is different,
              e.g. socket(2) on x86.
       -h     A simple one-line usage display.
