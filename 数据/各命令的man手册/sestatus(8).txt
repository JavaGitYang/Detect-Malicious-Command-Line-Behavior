       This manual page describes the sestatus program.
       This tool is used to get the status of a system running SELinux. It
       displays data about whether SELinux is enabled or disabled, location
       of key directories, and the loaded policy with its status as shown in
       the example:
              > sestatus
              SELinux status:              enabled
              SELinuxfs mount:             /selinux
              SELinux root directory:      /etc/selinux
              Loaded policy name:          targeted
              Current mode:                permissive
              Mode from config file:       enforcing
              Policy MLS status:           enabled
              Policy deny_unknown status:  allow
              Memory protection checking:  actual (secure)
              Max kernel policy version:   26
       sestatus can also be used to display:
              -   The security context of files and processes listed in the
                  /etc/sestatus.conf file. The format of this file is
                  described in sestatus.conf(5).
              -   The status of booleans.
