       For wcscoll(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() functions shall compare the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws1 to the wide-character string
       pointed to by ws2, both interpreted as appropriate to the LC_COLLATE
       category of the current locale, or the locale represented by locale,
       respectively.
       The wcscoll() and wcscoll_l() functions shall not change the setting
       of errno if successful.
       An application wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to 0 before calling wcscoll() or wcscoll_l().  If errno is non-zero
       on return, an error has occurred.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wcscoll_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
