       The exit utility shall cause the shell to exit with the exit status
       specified by the unsigned decimal integer n.  If n is specified, but
       its value is not between 0 and 255 inclusively, the exit status is
       undefined.
       A trap on EXIT shall be executed before the shell terminates, except
       when the exit utility is invoked in that trap itself, in which case
       the shell shall exit immediately.
