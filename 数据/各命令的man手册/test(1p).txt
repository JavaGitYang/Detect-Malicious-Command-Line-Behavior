       The test utility shall evaluate the expression and indicate the
       result of the evaluation by its exit status. An exit status of zero
       indicates that the expression evaluated as true and an exit status of
       1 indicates that the expression evaluated as false.
       In the second form of the utility, which uses "[]" rather than test,
       the application shall ensure that the square brackets are separate
       arguments.
