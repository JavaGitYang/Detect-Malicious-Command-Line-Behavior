       The putenv() function shall use the string argument to set
       environment variable values. The string argument should point to a
       string of the form "name=value".  The putenv() function shall make
       the value of the environment variable name equal to value by altering
       an existing variable or creating a new one. In either case, the
       string pointed to by string shall become part of the environment, so
       altering the string shall change the environment.
       The putenv() function need not be thread-safe.
