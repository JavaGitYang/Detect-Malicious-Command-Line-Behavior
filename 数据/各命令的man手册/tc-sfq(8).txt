       Stochastic Fairness Queueing is a classless queueing discipline
       available for traffic control with the tc(8) command.
       SFQ does not shape traffic but only schedules the transmission of
       packets, based on 'flows'.  The goal is to ensure fairness so that
       each flow is able to send data in turn, thus preventing any single
       flow from drowning out the rest.
       This may in fact have some effect in mitigating a Denial of Service
       attempt.
       SFQ is work-conserving and therefore always delivers a packet if it
       has one available.
