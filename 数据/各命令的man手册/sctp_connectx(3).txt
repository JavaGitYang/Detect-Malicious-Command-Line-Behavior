       sctp_connectx initiates a connection to a set of addresses passed in
       the array addrs to/from the socket sd.  addrcnt is the number of
       addresses in the array.
       If sd is an IPv4 socket, the addresses passed must be IPv4 addresses.
       If sd is an IPv6 socket, the addresses passed can be either IPv4 or
       IPv6 addresses.
       addrs is a pointer to an array of one or more socket addresses. Each
       address is contained in its appropriate structure(i.e. struct
       sockaddr_in or struct sockaddr_in6). The family of the address type
       must be used to distinguish the address length. The caller specifies
       the number of addresses in the array with addrcnt.
       id is a pointer to the association id and, if provided, will be set
       to the identifier of the newly created association.
