       The pwck command verifies the integrity of the users and
       authentication information. It checks that all entries in /etc/passwd
       and /etc/shadow have the proper format and contain valid data. The
       user is prompted to delete entries that are improperly formatted or
       which have other uncorrectable errors.
       Checks are made to verify that each entry has:
       ·   the correct number of fields
       ·   a unique and valid user name
       ·   a valid user and group identifier
       ·   a valid primary group
       ·   a valid home directory
       ·   a valid login shell
       shadow checks are enabled when a second file parameter is specified
       or when /etc/shadow exists on the system.
       These checks are the following:
       ·   every passwd entry has a matching shadow entry, and every shadow
           entry has a matching passwd entry
       ·   passwords are specified in the shadowed file
       ·   shadow entries have the correct number of fields
       ·   shadow entries are unique in shadow
       ·   the last password changes are not in the future
       The checks for correct number of fields and unique user name are
       fatal. If the entry has the wrong number of fields, the user will be
       prompted to delete the entire line. If the user does not answer
       affirmatively, all further checks are bypassed. An entry with a
       duplicated user name is prompted for deletion, but the remaining
       checks will still be made. All other errors are warning and the user
       is encouraged to run the usermod command to correct the error.
       The commands which operate on the /etc/passwd file are not able to
       alter corrupted or duplicated entries.  pwck should be used in those
       circumstances to remove the offending entry.
