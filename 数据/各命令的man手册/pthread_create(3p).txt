       The pthread_create() function shall create a new thread, with
       attributes specified by attr, within a process. If attr is NULL, the
       default attributes shall be used. If the attributes specified by attr
       are modified later, the thread's attributes shall not be affected.
       Upon successful completion, pthread_create() shall store the ID of
       the created thread in the location referenced by thread.
       The thread is created executing start_routine with arg as its sole
       argument. If the start_routine returns, the effect shall be as if
       there was an implicit call to pthread_exit() using the return value
       of start_routine as the exit status. Note that the thread in which
       main() was originally invoked differs from this. When it returns from
       main(), the effect shall be as if there was an implicit call to
       exit() using the return value of main() as the exit status.
       The signal state of the new thread shall be initialized as follows:
        *  The signal mask shall be inherited from the creating thread.
        *  The set of signals pending for the new thread shall be empty.
       The thread-local current locale and the alternate stack shall not be
       inherited.
       The floating-point environment shall be inherited from the creating
       thread.
       If pthread_create() fails, no new thread is created and the contents
       of the location referenced by thread are undefined.
       If _POSIX_THREAD_CPUTIME is defined, the new thread shall have a CPU-
       time clock accessible, and the initial value of this clock shall be
       set to zero.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_create() does not refer to an initialized thread
       attributes object.
