       dh_testroot is used to determine if the package has access to at
       least the level of root access that it declared it needed via the
       Rules-Requires-Root (R続) field.
       The following is how dh_testroot behaves based on the effective value
       of the R続 field:
       "binary-targets"
           dh_testroot asserts that it is run as root or under fakeroot(1).
       "no"
           dh_testroot returns successfully.
       Any other value than the above
           dh_testroot asserts that it is either run as root (or under
           fakeroot(1)) or the builder has provided the DEB_GAIN_ROOT_CMD
           environment variable (e.g. via dpkg-buildpackage -r).
       For backwards compatibility, dh_testroot will consider the absence of
       the R続 field as if the R続 field was set to "binary-targets".
