       pmdaInit initializes a PMDA so that it is ready to receive PDUs from
       pmcd(1).  The function expects as arguments the instance domain table
       (indoms) and the metric description table (metrics) that are
       initialized by the PMDA. The arguments nindoms and nmetrics should be
       set to the number of instances and metrics in the tables,
       respectively.
       Much of the pmdaInterface structure can be automatically initialized
       with pmdaDaemon(3), pmdaGetOpt(3) and pmdaDSO(3).  pmdaInit completes
       the PMDA initialization phase with three operations.  The first
       operation adds the domain and instance numbers to the instance and
       metric tables.  Singular metrics (metrics without an instance domain)
       should have the instance domain PM_INDOM_NULL set in the indom field
       of the pmDesc structure (see pmLookupDesc(3)).  Metrics with an
       instance domain should set this field to be the serial number of the
       instance domain in the indoms table.
       The instance domain table may be made empty by setting indoms to NULL
       and nindoms to 0.  This allows the caller to provide custom Fetch and
       Instance callback functions.  The metric table may be made empty by
       setting metrics to NULL and nmetrics to 0.  This allows the caller to
       provide custom Fetch and Descriptor callback functions.
