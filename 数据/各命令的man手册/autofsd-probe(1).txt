       autofsd-probe will check the status of the autofsd(1) daemon on the
       specified host.
       Unless directed to another host by the -h option, autofsd-probe will
       contact the AutoFS daemon on the local host.
       The AutoFS file system is built on the Remote Procedure Call (RPC(3))
       library routines.  The -t option allows the total timeout and retry
       timeout intervals to be set for all remote procedure call operations
       used with autofsd-probe.  This option accepts an interval argument in
       the form described in the PCPintro(1) manual page.
       autofsd-probe is typically used in an automated fashion from within
       pmdashping(1) and in conjunction with pmie(1), for monitoring
       response time and service failure.
       By default autofsd-probe will not produce any output, unless there is
       an error in which case a diagnostic message will be displayed and the
       exit status will indicate the reason for failure.
