       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaLabel uses the standard PMDA(3) data structures to
       return the labels for performance domain, instance domain, metric or
       individual instances in "JSONB" format in the given sets data
       structure.
       The type argument determines the interpretation of ident and the
       requested form of label, as follows:
       PM_LABEL_DOMAIN
           when ident is a PMDA domain identifier,
       PM_LABEL_CLUSTER
           when ident is a metric identifier and labels for the cluster
           containing that metric are being requested.
       PM_LABEL_ITEM
           when ident is a metric identifier,
       PM_LABEL_INDOM
           when ident is an instance domain identifier, or
       PM_LABEL_INSTANCES
           when ident is a metric identifier and labels for all instances of
           that metric are being requested.
       The label sets pointer must be initialised to NULL before calling
       pmdaLabel and space is only to be allocated when labels are present
       and returned.  In this case, the return code must indicate the number
       of label sets that have been allocated.  This will only ever be
       greater than one in the PM_LABEL_INSTANCES case.
       This is one of the few generic callbacks in libpcp_pmda (see PMDA(3))
       that is incomplete, requiring a further pmdaLabelCallBack method of
       its own.  The additional callback should be registered using
       pmdaSetLabelCallBack and the pmdaLabelCallBack method has the
       following prototype:
       int func(pmInDom indom, unsigned int inst, pmLabelSet **set)
       The purpose of the pmdaLabelCallBack routine is to return the
       label(s) for an individual instance inst of a given instance domain,
       indom.  Its successful return code differs significantly to
       pmdaLabel, as described below.
