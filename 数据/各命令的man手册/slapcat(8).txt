       Slapcat is used to generate an LDAP Directory Interchange Format
       (LDIF) output based upon the contents of a slapd(8) database.  It
       opens the given database determined by the database number or suffix
       and writes the corresponding LDIF to standard output or the specified
       file.  Databases configured as subordinate of this one are also
       output, unless -g is specified.
       The entry records are presented in database order, not superior first
       order.  The entry records will include all (user and operational)
       attributes stored in the database.  The entry records will not
       include dynamically generated attributes (such as subschemaSubentry).
       The output of slapcat is intended to be used as input to slapadd(8).
       The output of slapcat cannot generally be used as input to ldapadd(1)
       or other LDAP clients without first editing the output.  This editing
       would normally include reordering the records into superior first
       order and removing no-user-modification operational attributes.
