       This manual page describes the GNU -mwww macro package, which is part
       of the groff document formatting system.  The manual page is very a
       basic guide, and the HTML device driver (grohtml) has been completely
       rewritten but still remains as in an alpha state.  It has been
       included into the distribution so that a lot of people have a chance
       to test it.  Note that this macro file is automatically called (via
       the troffrc file) if you use -Thtml or -Txhtml.
       To see the hyperlinks in action, please format this man page with the
       grohtml device.
