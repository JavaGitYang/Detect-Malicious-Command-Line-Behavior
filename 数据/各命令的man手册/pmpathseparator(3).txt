       pmPathSeparator is a convenience method that returns ``/'' in  the
       civilized world.  For Windows platforms you may get ``/'' or ``\''
       depending on the run-time environment.
       The most common use scenario is to use pmPathSeparator to construct
       the full pathname for a file from a known directory name and a
       relative file name.
