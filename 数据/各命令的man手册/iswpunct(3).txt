       The iswpunct() function is the wide-character equivalent of the
       ispunct(3) function.  It tests whether wc is a wide character
       belonging to the wide-character class "punct".
       The wide-character class "punct" is a subclass of the wide-character
       class "graph", and therefore also a subclass of the wide-character
       class "print".
       The wide-character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character
       class "alnum" and therefore also disjoint from its subclasses
       "alpha", "upper", "lower", "digit", "xdigit".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "print", the wide-
       character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "cntrl".
       Being a subclass of the wide-character class "graph", the wide-
       character class "punct" is disjoint from the wide-character class
       "space" and its subclass "blank".
