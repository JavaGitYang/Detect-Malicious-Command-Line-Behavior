       xfs_admin uses the xfs_db(8) command to modify various parameters of
       a filesystem.
       Devices that are mounted cannot be modified.  Administrators must
       unmount filesystems before xfs_admin or xfs_db(8) can convert
       parameters.  A number of parameters of a mounted filesystem can be
       examined and modified using the xfs_growfs(8) command.
