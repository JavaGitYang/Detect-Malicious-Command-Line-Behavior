       The pthread_attr_setstack() function sets the stack address and stack
       size attributes of the thread attributes object referred to by attr
       to the values specified in stackaddr and stacksize, respectively.
       These attributes specify the location and size of the stack that
       should be used by a thread that is created using the thread
       attributes object attr.
       stackaddr should point to the lowest addressable byte of a buffer of
       stacksize bytes that was allocated by the caller.  The pages of the
       allocated buffer should be both readable and writable.
       The pthread_attr_getstack() function returns the stack address and
       stack size attributes of the thread attributes object referred to by
       attr in the buffers pointed to by stackaddr and stacksize,
       respectively.
