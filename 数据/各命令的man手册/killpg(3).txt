       killpg() sends the signal sig to the process group pgrp.  See
       signal(7) for a list of signals.
       If pgrp is 0, killpg() sends the signal to the calling process's
       process group.  (POSIX says: if pgrp is less than or equal to 1, the
       behavior is undefined.)
       For the permissions required to send a signal to another process, see
       kill(2).
