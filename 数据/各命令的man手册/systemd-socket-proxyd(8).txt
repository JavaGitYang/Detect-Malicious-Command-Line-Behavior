       systemd-socket-proxyd is a generic socket-activated network socket
       forwarder proxy daemon for IPv4, IPv6 and UNIX stream sockets. It may
       be used to bi-directionally forward traffic from a local listening
       socket to a local or remote destination socket.
       One use of this tool is to provide socket activation support for
       services that do not natively support socket activation. On behalf of
       the service to activate, the proxy inherits the socket from systemd,
       accepts each client connection, opens a connection to a configured
       server for each client, and then bidirectionally forwards data
       between the two.
       This utility's behavior is similar to socat(1). The main differences
       for systemd-socket-proxyd are support for socket activation with
       "Accept=false" and an event-driven design that scales better with the
       number of connections.
