       Reset the patch stack to an earlier state. If no state is specified,
       reset only the changes in the worktree.
       The state is specified with a commit id from a stack log; "stg log"
       lets you view this log, and "stg reset" lets you reset to any state
       you see in the log. If one or more patch names are given, reset only
       those patches, and leave the rest alone.
