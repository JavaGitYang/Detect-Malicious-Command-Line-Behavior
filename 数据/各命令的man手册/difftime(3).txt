       The difftime() function returns the number of seconds elapsed between
       time time1 and time time0, represented as a double.  Each of the
       times is specified in calendar time, which means its value is a
       measurement (in seconds) relative to the Epoch, 1970-01-01 00:00:00
       +0000 (UTC).
