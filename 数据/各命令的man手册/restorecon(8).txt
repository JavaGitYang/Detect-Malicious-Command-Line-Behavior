       This manual page describes the restorecon program.
       This program is primarily used to set the security context (extended
       attributes) on one or more files.
       It can also be run at any other time to correct inconsistent labels,
       to add support for newly-installed policy or, by using the -n option,
       to passively check whether the file contexts are all set as specified
       by the active policy (default behavior).
       If a file object does not have a context, restorecon will write the
       default context to the file object's extended attributes. If a file
       object has a context, restorecon will only modify the type portion of
       the security context.  The -F option will force a replacement of the
       entire context.
       If a file is labeled with customizable SELinux type (for list of
       customizable types see
       /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/contexts/customizable_types), restorecon
       won't reset the label unless the -F option is used.
       It is the same executable as setfiles but operates in a slightly
       different manner depending on its argv[0].
