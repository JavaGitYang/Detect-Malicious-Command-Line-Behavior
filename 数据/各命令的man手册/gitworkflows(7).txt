       This document attempts to write down and motivate some of the
       workflow elements used for git.git itself. Many ideas apply in
       general, though the full workflow is rarely required for smaller
       projects with fewer people involved.
       We formulate a set of rules for quick reference, while the prose
       tries to motivate each of them. Do not always take them literally;
       you should value good reasons for your actions higher than manpages
       such as this one.
