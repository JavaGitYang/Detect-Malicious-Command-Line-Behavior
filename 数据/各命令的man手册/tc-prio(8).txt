       The PRIO qdisc is a simple classful queueing discipline that contains
       an arbitrary number of classes of differing priority. The classes are
       dequeued in numerical descending order of priority. PRIO is a
       scheduler and never delays packets - it is a work-conserving qdisc,
       though the qdiscs contained in the classes may not be.
       Very useful for lowering latency when there is no need for slowing
       down traffic.
