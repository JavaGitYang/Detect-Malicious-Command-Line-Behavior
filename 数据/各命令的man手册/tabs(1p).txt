       The tabs utility shall display a series of characters that first
       clears the hardware terminal tab settings and then initializes the
       tab stops at the specified positions and optionally adjusts the
       margin.
       The phrase ``tab-stop position N'' shall be taken to mean that, from
       the start of a line of output, tabbing to position N shall cause the
       next character output to be in the (N+1)th column position on that
       line. The maximum number of tab stops allowed is terminal-dependent.
       It need not be possible to implement tabs on certain terminals. If
       the terminal type obtained from the TERM environment variable or âˆ’T
       option represents such a terminal, an appropriate diagnostic message
       shall be written to standard error and tabs shall exit with a status
       greater than zero.
