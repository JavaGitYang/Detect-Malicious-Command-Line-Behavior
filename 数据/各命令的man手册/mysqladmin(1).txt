       mysqladmin is a client for performing administrative operations. You
       can use it to check the server´s configuration and current status, to
       create and drop databases, and more.
       Invoke mysqladmin like this:
           shell> mysqladmin [options] command [command-arg] [command [command-arg]] ...
       mysqladmin supports the following commands. Some of the commands take
       an argument following the command name.
       ·   create db_name
           Create a new database named db_name.
       ·   debug
           Tell the server to write debug information to the error log.
           This also includes information about the Event Scheduler.
       ·   drop db_name
           Delete the database named db_name and all its tables.
       ·   extended-status
           Display the server status variables and their values.
       ·   flush-all-statistics
           Flush all statistics tables.
       ·   flush-all-status
           Flush all status and statistics.
       ·   flush-binary-log
           Flush the binary log.

           Flush engine log.
       ·   flush-error-log
           Flush error log.
       ·   flush-general-log
           Flush general query log.
       ·   flush-hosts
           Flush all information in the host cache.
       ·   flush-index-statistics
           Flush index statistics.
       ·   flush-logs
           Flush all logs.
       ·   flush-privileges
           Reload the grant tables (same as reload).
       ·   flush-relay-log
           Flush relay log.
       ·   flush-slow-log
           Flush slow query log.
       ·   flush-status
           Clear status variables.
       ·   flush-table-statistics
           Flush table statistics.
       ·   flush-tables
           Flush all tables.
       ·   flush-threads
           Flush the thread cache.
       ·   flush-user-resources
           Flush user resources.
       ·   kill id,id,...
           Kill server threads. If multiple thread ID values are given,
           there must be no spaces in the list.
       ·   old-password new-password
           This is like the password command but stores the password using
           the old (pre MySQL 4.1) password-hashing format.
       ·   password new-password
           Set a new password. This changes the password to new-password for
           the account that you use with mysqladmin for connecting to the
           server. Thus, the next time you invoke mysqladmin (or any other
           client program) using the same account, you will need to specify
           the new password.
           If the new-password value contains spaces or other characters
           that are special to your command interpreter, you need to enclose
           it within quotes. On Windows, be sure to use double quotes rather
           than single quotes; single quotes are not stripped from the
           password, but rather are interpreted as part of the password. For
           example:
               shell> mysqladmin password "my new password"
               Caution
               Do not use this command used if the server was started with
               the --skip-grant-tables option. No password change will be
               applied. This is true even if you precede the password
               command with flush-privileges on the same command line to
               re-enable the grant tables because the flush operation occurs
               after you connect. However, you can use mysqladmin
               flush-privileges to re-enable the grant table and then use a
               separate mysqladmin password command to change the password.
       ·   ping
           Check whether the server is alive. The return status from
           mysqladmin is 0 if the server is running, 1 if it is not. This is
           0 even in case of an error such as Access denied, because this
           means that the server is running but refused the connection,
           which is different from the server not running.
       ·   processlist
           Show a list of active server threads. This is like the output of
           the SHOW PROCESSLIST statement. If the --verbose option is given,
           the output is like that of SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST.
       ·   reload
           Reload the grant tables.
       ·   refresh
           Flush all tables and close and open log files.
       ·   shutdown
           Stop the server.
       ·   start-all-slaves
           Start all slaves.
       ·   start-slave
           Start replication on a slave server.
       ·   status
           Display a short server status message.
       ·   stop-all-slaves
           Stop all slaves.
       ·   stop-slave
           Stop replication on a slave server.
       ·   variables
           Display the server system variables and their values.
       ·   version
           Display version information from the server.
       All commands can be shortened to any unique prefix. For example:
           shell> mysqladmin proc stat
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | Id | User  | Host      | db | Command | Time | State | Info             |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+
           | 51 | monty | localhost |    | Query   | 0    |       | show processlist |
           +----+-------+-----------+----+---------+------+-------+------------------+

       ·   Maximum memory used
           The maximum amount of memory allocated directly by mysqld. This
           value is displayed only when MariaDB has been compiled with
           --with-debug=full.
       If you execute mysqladmin shutdown when connecting to a local server
       using a Unix socket file, mysqladmin waits until the server´s process
       ID file has been removed, to ensure that the server has stopped
       properly.
       mysqladmin supports the following options, which can be specified on
       the command line or in the [mysqladmin] and [client] option file
       groups.

           if the --sleep option is given.
       ·   --debug[=debug_options], -# [debug_options]
           Write a debugging log. A typical debug_options string is
           ´d:t:o,file_name´. The default is ´d:t:o,/tmp/mysqladmin.trace´.

           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override
           global defaults files. Must be given as first option.
       ·   --force, -f
           Do not ask for confirmation for the drop db_name command. With
           multiple commands, continue even if an error occurs.
       ·   --host=host_name, -h host_name
           Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.
       ·   --local, -l
           Suppress the SQL command(s) from being written to the binary log
           by using FLUSH LOCAL or enabling sql_log_bin=0 for the session.
       ·   --no-beep, -b
           Suppress the warning beep that is emitted by default for errors
           such as a failure to connect to the server.

           option and the password. If you omit the password value following
           the --password or -p option on the command line, mysqladmin
           prompts for one.
           Specifying a password on the command line should be considered
           insecure.
       ·   --pipe, -W
           On Windows, connect to the server via a named pipe. This option
           applies only if the server supports named-pipe connections.

           the first argument.
       ·   --protocol={TCP|SOCKET|PIPE|MEMORY}
           The connection protocol to use for connecting to the server. It
           is useful when the other connection parameters normally would
           cause a protocol to be used other than the one you want.
       ·   --relative, -r
           Show the difference between the current and previous values when
           used with the --sleep option. Currently, this option works only
           with the extended-status command.
       ·   --shutdown-timeouttimeout
           Equivalent of --shutdown_timeout, see the end of this section.
       ·   --silent, -s
           Exit silently if a connection to the server cannot be
           established.
       ·   --sleep=delay, -i delay
           Execute commands repeatedly, sleeping for delay seconds in
           between. The --count option determines the number of iterations.
           If --count is not given, mysqladmin executes commands
           indefinitely until interrupted.
       ·   --socket=path, -S path
           For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use, or, on
           Windows, the name of the named pipe to use.
       ·   --ssl

           SSL cipher to use (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-key=name
           X509 key in PEM format (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-crl=name
           Certificate revocation list (check OpenSSL docs, implies --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-crlpath=name
           Certificate revocation list path (check OpenSSL docs, implies
           --ssl).
       ·   --ssl-verify-server-cert
           Verify server's "Common Name" in its cert against hostname used
           when connecting. This option is disabled by default.
       ·   --user=user_name, -u user_name
           The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
       ·   --verbose, -v
           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
       ·   --version, -V
           Display version information and exit.
       ·   --vertical, -E
           Print output vertically. This is similar to --relative, but
           prints output vertically.
       ·   --wait[=count], -w[count]
           If the connection cannot be established, wait and retry instead
           of aborting. If a count value is given, it indicates the number
           of times to retry. The default is one time.
       You can also set the following variables by using --var_name=value
       ·   connect_timeout
           The maximum number of seconds before connection timeout. The
           default value is 43200 (12 hours).
       ·   shutdown_timeout
           The maximum number of seconds to wait for server shutdown. The
           default value is 3600 (1 hour).
