       inotify_add_watch() adds a new watch, or modifies an existing watch,
       for the file whose location is specified in pathname; the caller must
       have read permission for this file.  The fd argument is a file
       descriptor referring to the inotify instance whose watch list is to
       be modified.  The events to be monitored for pathname are specified
       in the mask bit-mask argument.  See inotify(7) for a description of
       the bits that can be set in mask.
       A successful call to inotify_add_watch() returns a unique watch
       descriptor for this inotify instance, for the filesystem object
       (inode) that corresponds to pathname.  If the filesystem object was
       not previously being watched by this inotify instance, then the watch
       descriptor is newly allocated.  If the filesystem object was already
       being watched (perhaps via a different link to the same object), then
       the descriptor for the existing watch is returned.
       The watch descriptor is returned by later read(2)s from the inotify
       file descriptor.  These reads fetch inotify_event structures (see
       inotify(7)) indicating filesystem events; the watch descriptor inside
       this structure identifies the object for which the event occurred.
