       Run a program under a pseudo terminal. This is used by run_init to
       run actually run the program after setting up the proper context.
       This program acquires a new Pseudo terminal, forks a child process
       that binds to the pseudo terminal, and then sits around and connects
       the physical terminal it was invoked upon with the pseudo terminal,
       passing keyboard input into to the child process, and passing the
       output of the child process to the physical terminal.
       It sets up the pseudo terminal properly based on the physical
       terminal attributes, and then sets the user's terminal to RAW mode,
       taking care to reset it on exit.
