       Some of the functionality described on this reference page extends
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The ISO C standard only requires the symbols [EDOM], [EILSEQ], and
       [ERANGE] to be defined.
       The <errno.h> header shall provide a declaration or definition for
       errno.  The symbol errno shall expand to a modifiable lvalue of type
       int.  It is unspecified whether errno is a macro or an identifier
       declared with external linkage. If a macro definition is suppressed
       in order to access an actual object, or a program defines an
       identifier with the name errno, the behavior is undefined.
       The <errno.h> header shall define the following macros which shall
       expand to integer constant expressions with type int, distinct
       positive values (except as noted below), and which shall be suitable
       for use in #if preprocessing directives:
