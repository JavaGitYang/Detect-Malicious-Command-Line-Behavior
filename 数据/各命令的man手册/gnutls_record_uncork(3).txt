       This resets the effect of gnutls_record_cork(), and flushes any
       pending data. If the GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT flag is specified then this
       function will block until the data is sent or a fatal error occurs
       (i.e., the function will retry on GNUTLS_E_AGAIN and
       GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED).
       If the flag GNUTLS_RECORD_WAIT is not specified and the function is
       interrupted then the GNUTLS_E_AGAIN or GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED errors
       will be returned. To obtain the data left in the corked buffer use
       gnutls_record_check_corked().
