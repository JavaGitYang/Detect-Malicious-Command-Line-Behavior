       A systemtap compile server listens for connections from stap clients
       on a secure SSL network port and accepts requests to run the stap
       front end. Each server advertises its presence and configuration on
       the local network using mDNS (avahi) allowing for automatic detection
       by clients.
       The stap-server script aims to provide:
       ·   management of systemtap compile servers as a service.
       ·   convenient control over configured servers and individual
           (ad-hoc) servers.
