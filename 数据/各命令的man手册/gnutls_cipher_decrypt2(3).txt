       This function will decrypt the given data using the algorithm
       specified by the context. For block ciphers the  ctext_len must be a
       multiple of the block size. For the supported ciphers the plaintext
       data length will equal the ciphertext size.
       Note that in AEAD ciphers, this will not check the tag. You will need
       to compare the tag sent with the value returned from
       gnutls_cipher_tag().
