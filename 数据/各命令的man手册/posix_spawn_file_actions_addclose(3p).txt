       These functions shall add or delete a close or open action to a spawn
       file actions object.
       A spawn file actions object is of type posix_spawn_file_actions_t
       (defined in <spawn.h>) and is used to specify a series of actions to
       be performed by a posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp() operation in order
       to arrive at the set of open file descriptors for the child process
       given the set of open file descriptors of the parent.  POSIX.1‚Äê2008
       does not define comparison or assignment operators for the type
       posix_spawn_file_actions_t.
       A spawn file actions object, when passed to posix_spawn() or
       posix_spawnp(), shall specify how the set of open file descriptors in
       the calling process is transformed into a set of potentially open
       file descriptors for the spawned process. This transformation shall
       be as if the specified sequence of actions was performed exactly
       once, in the context of the spawned process (prior to execution of
       the new process image), in the order in which the actions were added
       to the object; additionally, when the new process image is executed,
       any file descriptor (from this new set) which has its FD_CLOEXEC flag
       set shall be closed (see posix_spawn(3p)).
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose() function shall add a close
       action to the object referenced by file_actions that shall cause the
       file descriptor fildes to be closed (as if close(fildes) had been
       called) when a new process is spawned using this file actions object.
       The posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function shall add an open
       action to the object referenced by file_actions that shall cause the
       file named by path to be opened (as if open(path, oflag, mode) had
       been called, and the returned file descriptor, if not fildes, had
       been changed to fildes) when a new process is spawned using this file
       actions object. If fildes was already an open file descriptor, it
       shall be closed before the new file is opened.
       The string described by path shall be copied by the
       posix_spawn_file_actions_addopen() function.
