       epoll_create() creates a new epoll(7) instance.  Since Linux 2.6.8,
       the size argument is ignored, but must be greater than zero; see
       NOTES below.
       epoll_create() returns a file descriptor referring to the new epoll
       instance.  This file descriptor is used for all the subsequent calls
       to the epoll interface.  When no longer required, the file descriptor
       returned by epoll_create() should be closed by using close(2).  When
       all file descriptors referring to an epoll instance have been closed,
       the kernel destroys the instance and releases the associated
       resources for reuse.
   epoll_create1()
       If flags is 0, then, other than the fact that the obsolete size
       argument is dropped, epoll_create1() is the same as epoll_create().
       The following value can be included in flags to obtain different
       behavior:
       EPOLL_CLOEXEC
              Set the close-on-exec (FD_CLOEXEC) flag on the new file
              descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
              open(2) for reasons why this may be useful.
