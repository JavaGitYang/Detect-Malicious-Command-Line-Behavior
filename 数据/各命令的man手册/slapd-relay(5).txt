       The primary purpose of this slapd(8) backend is to map a naming
       context defined in a database running in the same slapd(8) instance
       into a virtual naming context, with attributeType and objectClass
       manipulation, if required.  It requires the slapo-rwm(5) overlay.
       This backend and the above mentioned overlay are experimental.
