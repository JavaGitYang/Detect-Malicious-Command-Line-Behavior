       matchpathcon queries the system policy and outputs the default
       security context associated with the filepath.
       Note: Identical paths can have different security contexts, depending
       on the file type (regular file, directory, link file, char file ...).
       matchpathcon will also take the file type into consideration in
       determining the default security context if the file exists.  If the
       file does not exist, no file type matching will occur.
