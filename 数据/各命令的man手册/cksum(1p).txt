       The cksum utility shall calculate and write to standard output a
       cyclic redundancy check (CRC) for each input file, and also write to
       standard output the number of octets in each file. The CRC used is
       based on the polynomial used for CRC error checking in the
       ISO/IEC 8802‐3:1996 standard (Ethernet).
       The encoding for the CRC checksum is defined by the generating
       polynomial:
           G(x)=x32+x26+x23+x22+x16+x12+x11+x10+x8+x7+x5+x4+x2+x+1
       Mathematically, the CRC value corresponding to a given file shall be
       defined by the following procedure:
        1. The n bits to be evaluated are considered to be the coefficients
           of a mod 2 polynomial M(x) of degree n−1.  These n bits are the
           bits from the file, with the most significant bit being the most
           significant bit of the first octet of the file and the last bit
           being the least significant bit of the last octet, padded with
           zero bits (if necessary) to achieve an integral number of octets,
           followed by one or more octets representing the length of the
           file as a binary value, least significant octet first. The
           smallest number of octets capable of representing this integer
           shall be used.
        2. M(x) is multiplied by x32 (that is, shifted left 32 bits) and
           divided by G(x) using mod 2 division, producing a remainder R(x)
           of degree ≤ 31.
        3. The coefficients of R(x) are considered to be a 32-bit sequence.
        4. The bit sequence is complemented and the result is the CRC.
