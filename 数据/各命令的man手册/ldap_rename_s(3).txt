       These routines are used to perform a LDAP rename operation.  The
       function changes the leaf component of an entry's distinguished name
       and  optionally moves the entry to a new parent container. The
       ldap_rename_s performs a rename operation synchronously.  The method
       takes dn, which points to the distinguished name of the entry whose
       attribute is being compared, newparent,the distinguished name of the
       entry's new parent. If this parameter is NULL, only the RDN is
       changed.  The root DN is specified by passing a zero length string,
       "".  deleteoldrdn specifies whether the old RDN should be retained or
       deleted.  Zero indicates that the old RDN should be retained. If you
       choose this option, the attribute will contain both names (the old
       and the new).  Non-zero indicates that the old RDN should be deleted.
       serverctrls points to an array of LDAPControl structures that list
       the client controls to use with this extended operation. Use NULL to
       specify no client controls. clientctrls points to an array of
       LDAPControl structures that list the client controls to use with the
       search.
       ldap_rename works just like ldap_rename_s, but the operation is
       asynchronous. It returns the message id of the request it initiated.
       The result of this operation can be obtained by calling
       ldap_result(3).
