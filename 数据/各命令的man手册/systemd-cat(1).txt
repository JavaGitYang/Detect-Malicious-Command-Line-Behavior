       systemd-cat may be used to connect the standard input and output of a
       process to the journal, or as a filter tool in a shell pipeline to
       pass the output the previous pipeline element generates to the
       journal.
       If no parameter is passed, systemd-cat will write everything it reads
       from standard input (stdin) to the journal.
       If parameters are passed, they are executed as command line with
       standard output (stdout) and standard error output (stderr) connected
       to the journal, so that all it writes is stored in the journal.
