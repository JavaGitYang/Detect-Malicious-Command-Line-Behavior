       Firecfg is the desktop integration utility for Firejail sandbox.  It
       allows the user to sandbox applications automatically by clicking on
       desktop manager icons and menus.
       The integration covers:
              - programs started in a terminal - typing "firefox" would be
              enough to start a sandboxed Firefox browser
              - programs started by clicking on desktop manager menus - all
              major desktop managers are supported
              - programs started by clicking on file icons in file manager -
              only Cinnamon, KDE, LXDE/LXQT, MATE and XFCE desktop managers
              are supported in this moment
       To set it up, run "sudo firecfg" after installing Firejail software.
       The same command should also be run after installing new programs. If
       the program is supported by Firejail, the symbolic link in
       /usr/local/bin will be created. For a full list of programs supported
       by default run "cat /usr/lib/firejail/firecfg.config".
       For user-driven manual integration, see DESKTOP INTEGRATION section
       in man 1 firejail.
