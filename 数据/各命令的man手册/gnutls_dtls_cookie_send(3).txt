       This function can be used to prevent denial of service attacks to a
       DTLS server by requiring the client to reply using a cookie sent by
       this function. That way it can be ensured that a client we allocated
       resources for (i.e. gnutls_session_t) is the one that the original
       incoming packet was originated from.
       This function must be called at the first incoming packet, prior to
       allocating any resources and must be succeeded by
       gnutls_dtls_cookie_verify().
