       This function adds the trusted CAs in order to verify client or
       server certificates. In case of a client this is not required to be
       called if the certificates are not verified using
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers2().  This function may be called
       multiple times.
       In case of a server the names of the CAs set here will be sent to the
       client if a certificate request is sent. This can be disabled using
       gnutls_certificate_send_x509_rdn_sequence().
       This function can also accept URLs. In that case it will import all
       certificates that are marked as trusted. Note that the supported URLs
       are the ones indicated by gnutls_url_is_supported().
