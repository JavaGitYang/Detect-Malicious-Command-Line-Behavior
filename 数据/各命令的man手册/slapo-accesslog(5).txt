       The Access Logging overlay can be used to record all accesses to a
       given backend database on another database. This allows all of the
       activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary LDAP
       queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files.
       Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of
       operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log records
       from the logging database.  Log records are stored with audit schema
       (see below) to assure their readability whether viewed as LDIF or in
       raw form.
