       The pam_limits PAM module sets limits on the system resources that
       can be obtained in a user-session. Users of uid=0 are affected by
       this limits, too.
       By default limits are taken from the /etc/security/limits.conf config
       file. Then individual *.conf files from the /etc/security/limits.d/
       directory are read. The files are parsed one after another in the
       order of "C" locale. The effect of the individual files is the same
       as if all the files were concatenated together in the order of
       parsing. If a config file is explicitly specified with a module
       option then the files in the above directory are not parsed.
       The module must not be called by a multithreaded application.
       If Linux PAM is compiled with audit support the module will report
       when it denies access based on limit of maximum number of concurrent
       login sessions.
