       Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as refs)
       were stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory under $GIT_DIR/refs
       directory. While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags
       and some branch tips are never updated. When a repository has
       hundreds or thousands of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both
       wastes storage and hurts performance.
       This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by
       storing the refs in a single file, $GIT_DIR/packed-refs. When a ref
       is missing from the traditional $GIT_DIR/refs directory hierarchy, it
       is looked up in this file and used if found.
       Subsequent updates to branches always create new files under
       $GIT_DIR/refs directory hierarchy.
       A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs
       is to pack its refs with --all once, and occasionally run git
       pack-refs. Tags are by definition stationary and are not expected to
       change. Branch heads will be packed with the initial pack-refs --all,
       but only the currently active branch heads will become unpacked, and
       the next pack-refs (without --all) will leave them unpacked.
