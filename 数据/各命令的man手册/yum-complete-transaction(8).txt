       yum-complete-transaction is a program which finds incomplete or
       aborted yum transactions on a system and attempts to complete them.
       It looks at the transaction-all* and transaction-done* files which
       can normally be found in /var/lib/yum if a yum transaction aborted in
       the middle of execution.
       If it finds more than one unfinished transaction it will attempt to
       complete the most recent one first. You can run it more than once to
       clean up all unfinished transactions.
