       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The mbstowcs() function shall convert a sequence of characters that
       begins in the initial shift state from the array pointed to by s into
       a sequence of corresponding wide-character codes and shall store not
       more than n wide-character codes into the array pointed to by pwcs.
       No characters that follow a null byte (which is converted into a
       wide-character code with value 0) shall be examined or converted.
       Each character shall be converted as if by a call to mbtowc(), except
       that the shift state of mbtowc() is not affected.
       No more than n elements shall be modified in the array pointed to by
       pwcs.  If copying takes place between objects that overlap, the
       behavior is undefined.
       The behavior of this function shall be affected by the LC_CTYPE
       category of the current locale.  If pwcs is a null pointer,
       mbstowcs() shall return the length required to convert the entire
       array regardless of the value of n, but no values are stored.
