       This function will extract the key purpose OIDs of the Certificate
       specified by the given index.  These are stored in the Extended Key
       Usage extension (2.5.29.37) See the GNUTLS_KP_* definitions for human
       readable names.
       If  oid is null then only the size will be filled. The  oid returned
       will be null terminated, although  oid_size will not account for the
       trailing null.
