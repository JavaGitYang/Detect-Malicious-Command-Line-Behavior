       dh_movefiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for moving
       files out of debian/tmp or some other directory and into other
       package build directories. This may be useful if your package has a
       Makefile that installs everything into debian/tmp, and you need to
       break that up into subpackages.
       Note: dh_install is a much better program, and you are recommended to
       use it instead of dh_movefiles.
