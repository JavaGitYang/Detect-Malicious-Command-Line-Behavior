       pvremove wipes the label on a device so that LVM will no longer
       recognise it as a PV.
       A PV cannot be removed from a VG while it is used by an active LV.
       Repeat the force option (-ff) to forcibly remove a PV belonging to an
       existing VG. Normally, vgreduce(8) should be used instead.
