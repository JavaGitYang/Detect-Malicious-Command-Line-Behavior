       pfbtops translates a PostScript font in .pfb format to ASCII,
       splitting overlong lines in text packets into smaller chunks.  If
       pfb_file is omitted the pfb file will be read from the standard
       input.  The ASCII format PostScript font will be written on the
       standard output.  PostScript fonts for MS-DOS are normally supplied
       in .pfb format.
       The resulting ASCII format PostScript font can be used with groff.
       It must first be listed in
       /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/font/devps/download and
       /usr/local/share/groff/1.22.3/font/devpdf/download.
