       The ngettext program translates a natural language message into the
       user's language, by looking up the translation in a message catalog,
       and chooses the appropriate plural form, which depends on the number
       COUNT and the language of the message catalog where the translation
       was found.
       Display native language translation of a textual message whose
       grammatical form depends on a number.

       MSGID MSGID-PLURAL

       If the TEXTDOMAIN parameter is not given, the domain is determined
       from the environment variable TEXTDOMAIN.  If the message catalog is
       not found in the regular directory, another location can be specified
       with the environment variable TEXTDOMAINDIR.  Standard search
       directory: /usr/local/share/locale
