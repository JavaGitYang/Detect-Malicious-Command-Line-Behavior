       The tapestat command is used for monitoring the activity of tape
       drives connected to a system.
       The first report generated by the tapestat command provides
       statistics concerning the time since the system was booted, unless
       the -y option is used, when this first report is omitted.  Each
       subsequent report covers the time since the previous report.
       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  The count parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the interval parameter. If the count parameter is
       specified, the value of count determines the number of reports
       generated at interval seconds apart. If the interval parameter is
       specified without the count parameter, the tapestat command generates
       reports continuously.
