       dh_installdebconf is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       installing files used by debconf into package build directories.
       It also automatically generates the postrm commands needed to
       interface with debconf. The commands are added to the maintainer
       scripts by dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation of
       how that works.
       Note that if you use debconf, your package probably needs to depend
       on it (it will be added to ${misc:Depends} by this program).
       Note that for your config script to be called by dpkg, your postinst
       needs to source debconf's confmodule. dh_installdebconf does not
       install this statement into the postinst automatically as it is too
       hard to do it right.
