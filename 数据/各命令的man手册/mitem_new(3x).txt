       The function new_item allocates a new item and initializes it from
       the name and description pointers. Please notice that the item stores
       only the pointers to the name and description. Those pointers must be
       valid during the lifetime of the item. So you should be very careful
       with names or descriptions allocated on the stack of some routines.
       The function free_item de-allocates an item. Please notice that it is
       the responsibility of the application to release the memory for the
       name or the description of the item.
