       This function is obsolete.  Do not use it.  If you want to read input
       without terminal echoing enabled, see the description of the ECHO
       flag in termios(3).
       The getpass() function opens /dev/tty (the controlling terminal of
       the process), outputs the string prompt, turns off echoing, reads one
       line (the "password"), restores the terminal state and closes
       /dev/tty again.
