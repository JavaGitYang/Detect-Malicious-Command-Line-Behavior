       genhomedircon is a script that executes semodule to rebuild the
       currently active SELinux policy (without reloading it) and to create
       the labels for each user home directory based on directory paths
       returned by calls to getpwent().
       The latter functionality depends on the "usepasswd" parameter being
       set to "true" (default) in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
       This script is usually executed by semanage although this default
       behavior can be optionally modified by setting to "true" the
       "disable-genhomedircon" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
