       HTB is meant as a more understandable and intuitive replacement for
       the CBQ qdisc in Linux. Both CBQ and HTB help you to control the use
       of the outbound bandwidth on a given link. Both allow you to use one
       physical link to simulate several slower links and to send different
       kinds of traffic on different simulated links. In both cases, you
       have to specify how to divide the physical link into simulated links
       and how to decide which simulated link to use for a given packet to
       be sent.
       Unlike CBQ, HTB shapes traffic based on the Token Bucket Filter
       algorithm which does not depend on interface characteristics and so
       does not need to know the underlying bandwidth of the outgoing
       interface.
