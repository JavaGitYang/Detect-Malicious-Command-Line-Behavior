       mysql_zap kills processes that match a pattern. It uses the ps
       command and Unix signals, so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.
       Invoke mysql_zap like this:
           shell> mysql_zap [-signal] [-?Ift] pattern
       A process matches if its output line from the ps command contains the
       pattern. By default, mysql_zap asks for confirmation for each
       process. Respond y to kill the process, or q to exit mysql_zap. For
       any other response, mysql_zap does not attempt to kill the process.
       If the -signal option is given, it specifies the name or number of
       the signal to send to each process. Otherwise, mysql_zap tries first
       with TERM (signal 15) and then with KILL (signal 9).
       mysql_zap supports the following additional options:
       ·   --help, -?, -I
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   -f
           Force mode.  mysql_zap attempts to kill each process without
           confirmation.
       ·   -t
           Test mode. Display information about each process but do not kill
           it.
