       gropdf translates the output of GNU troff to PDF.  Normally gropdf
       should be invoked by using the groff command with a -Tpdf option.  If
       no files are given, gropdf reads the standard input.  A filename of -
       also causes gropdf to read the standard input.  PDF output is written
       to the standard output.  When gropdf is run by groff options can be
       passed to gropdf using groff's -P option.
       See section FONT INSTALLATION below for a guide how to install fonts
       for gropdf.
