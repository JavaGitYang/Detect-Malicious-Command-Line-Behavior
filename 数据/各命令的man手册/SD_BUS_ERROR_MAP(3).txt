       The sd_bus_error_add_map() call may be used to register additional
       mappings for converting D-Bus errors to Linux errno-style errors. The
       mappings defined with this call are consulted by calls such as
       sd_bus_error_set(3) or sd_bus_error_get_errno(3). By default, a
       number of generic, standardized mappings are known, as documented in
       sd-bus-errors(3). Use this call to add further, application-specific
       mappings.
       The function takes a pointer to an array of sd_bus_error_map
       structures. A reference to the specified array is added to the lookup
       tables for error mappings. Note that the structure is not copied, and
       that it is hence essential that the array stays available and
       constant during the entire remaining runtime of the process.
       The mapping array should be put together with a series of
       SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP() macro invocations that take a literal name string
       and a (positive) errno-style error number. The last entry of the
       array should be an invocation of the SD_BUS_ERROR_MAP_END macro. The
       array should not be put together without use of these two macros.
       Note that the call is idempotent: it is safe to invoke it multiple
       times with the parameter, which will only add the passed mapping
       array once.
       Note that the memory allocated by this call is not intended to be
       freed during the lifetime of the process. It should not be freed
       explicitly.
