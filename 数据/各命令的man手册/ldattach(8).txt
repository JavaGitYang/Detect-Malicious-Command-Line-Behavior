       The ldattach daemon opens the specified device file (which should
       refer to a serial device) and attaches the line discipline ldisc to
       it for processing of the sent and/or received data.  It then goes
       into the background keeping the device open so that the line
       discipline stays loaded.
       The line discipline ldisc may be specified either by name or by
       number.
       In order to detach the line discipline, kill(1) the ldattach process.
       With no arguments, ldattach prints usage information.
