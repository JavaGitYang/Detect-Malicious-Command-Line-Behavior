       Never use this function.  Use mkstemp(3) or tmpfile(3) instead.
       The tempnam() function returns a pointer to a string that is a valid
       filename, and such that a file with this name did not exist when
       tempnam() checked.  The filename suffix of the pathname generated
       will start with pfx in case pfx is a non-NULL string of at most five
       bytes.  The directory prefix part of the pathname generated is
       required to be "appropriate" (often that at least implies writable).
       Attempts to find an appropriate directory go through the following
       steps:
       a) In case the environment variable TMPDIR exists and contains the
          name of an appropriate directory, that is used.
       b) Otherwise, if the dir argument is non-NULL and appropriate, it is
          used.
       c) Otherwise, P_tmpdir (as defined in <stdio.h>) is used when
          appropriate.
       d) Finally an implementation-defined directory may be used.
       The string returned by tempnam() is allocated using malloc(3) and
       hence should be freed by free(3).
