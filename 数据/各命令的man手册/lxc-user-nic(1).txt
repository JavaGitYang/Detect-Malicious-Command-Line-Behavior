       lxc-user-nic is a setuid-root program with which unprivileged users
       may create network interfaces for use by a lxc container.
       It will consult the configuration file /usr/local/etc/lxc/lxc-usernet
       to determine the number of interfaces which the calling user is
       allowed to create, and which bridge he may attach them to. It tracks
       the number of interfaces each user has created using the file
       /run/lxc/nics. It ensures that the calling user is privileged over
       the network namespace to which the interface will be attached.
