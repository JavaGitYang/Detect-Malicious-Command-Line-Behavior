       Plipconfig is used to (hopefully) improve PLIP performance by
       changing the default timing parameters used by the PLIP protocol.
       Results are dependent on the parallel port hardware, cable, and the
       CPU speed of each machine on each end of the PLIP link.
       If the single interface argument is given, plipconfig displays the
       status of the given interface only.  Otherwise, it will try to set
       the options.
