       The pathchk utility shall check that one or more pathnames are valid
       (that is, they could be used to access or create a file without
       causing syntax errors) and portable (that is, no filename truncation
       results). More extensive portability checks are provided by the −p
       and −P options.
       By default, the pathchk utility shall check each component of each
       pathname operand based on the underlying file system. A diagnostic
       shall be written for each pathname operand that:
        *  Is longer than {PATH_MAX} bytes (see Pathname Variable Values in
           the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2008, limits.h(0p))
        *  Contains any component longer than {NAME_MAX} bytes in its
           containing directory
        *  Contains any component in a directory that is not searchable
        *  Contains any byte sequence that is not valid in its containing
           directory
       The format of the diagnostic message is not specified, but shall
       indicate the error detected and the corresponding pathname operand.
       It shall not be considered an error if one or more components of a
       pathname operand do not exist as long as a file matching the pathname
       specified by the missing components could be created that does not
       violate any of the checks specified above.
