       lxc-start runs the specified command inside the container specified
       by name.
       It will setup the container according to the configuration previously
       defined with the lxc-create command or with the configuration file
       parameter.  If no configuration is defined, the default isolation is
       used.
       If no command is specified, lxc-start will use the command defined in
       lxc.init.cmd or if not set, the default "/sbin/init" command to run a
       system container.
