       LDAP authenticated binds, TLS encrypted connections and certification
       may be used by setting appropriate values in the autofs
       authentication configuration file and configuring the LDAP client
       with appropriate settings.  The default location of this file is
       @mapdir@/autofs_ldap_auth.conf.  If this file exists it will be used
       to establish whether TLS or authentication should be used.
       An example of this file is:
         <?xml version="1.0" ?>
         <autofs_ldap_sasl_conf
                 usetls="yes"
                 tlsrequired="no"
                 authrequired="no"
                 authtype="DIGEST-MD5"
                 user="xyz"
                 secret="abc"
         />
       If TLS encryption is to be used the location of the Certificate Au‐
       thority certificate must be set within the LDAP client configuration
       in order to validate the server certificate. If, in addition, a cer‐
       tified connection is to be used then the client certificate and pri‐
       vate key file locations must also be configured within the LDAP
       client.
