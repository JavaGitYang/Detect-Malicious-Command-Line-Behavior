       btrfs property is used to get/set/list property for given filesystem
       object. The object can be an inode (file or directory), subvolume or
       the whole filesystem. See the description of get subcommand for more
       information about both btrfs object and property.
       btrfs property provides an unified and user-friendly method to tune
       different btrfs properties instead of using the traditional method
       like chattr(1) or lsattr(1).
