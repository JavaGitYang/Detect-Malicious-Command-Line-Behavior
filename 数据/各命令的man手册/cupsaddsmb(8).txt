       The cupsaddsmb program exports printers to the SAMBA software
       (version 2.2.0 or higher) for use with Windows clients.  Depending on
       the SAMBA configuration, you may need to provide a password to export
       the printers.  This program requires the Windows printer driver files
       described below.
   SAMBA CONFIGURATION
       cupsaddsmb uses the RPC-based printing support in SAMBA to provide
       printer drivers and PPD files to Windows client machines.  In order
       to use this functionality, you must first configure the SAMBA
       smb.conf(5) file to support printing through CUPS and provide a
       printer driver download share, as follows:
           [global]
            load printers = yes
            printing = cups
            printcap name = cups
           [printers]
            comment = All Printers
            path = /var/spool/samba
            browseable = no
            public = yes
            guest ok = yes
            writable = no
            printable = yes
           [print$]
            comment = Printer Drivers
            path = /etc/samba/drivers
            browseable = yes
            guest ok = no
            read only = yes
            write list = root
       This configuration assumes a FHS-compliant installation of SAMBA;
       adjust the [printers] and [print$] share paths accordingly on your
       system as needed.
   MICROSOFT POSTSCRIPT DRIVERS FOR WINDOWS
       The base driver for Windows 2000 and higher is the Microsoft
       PostScript driver, which is available on any system running Windows
       2000 or higher in the %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\DRIVERS\W32X86\3 folder
       for 32-bit drivers and %WINDIR%\SYSTEM32\SPOOL\DRIVERS\X64\3 folder
       for 64-bit drivers.
       Copy the 32-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers directory and
       the 64-bit drivers to the /usr/share/cups/drivers/x64 directory
       exactly as named below:
           ps5ui.dll
           pscript.hlp
           pscript.ntf
           pscript5.dll
       Note: Unlike Windows, case is significant - make sure that you use
       the lowercase filenames shown above, otherwise cupsaddsmb will fail
       to export the drivers.
