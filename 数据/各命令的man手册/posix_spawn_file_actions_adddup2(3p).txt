       The posix_spawn_file_actions_adddup2() function shall add a dup2()
       action to the object referenced by file_actions that shall cause the
       file descriptor fildes to be duplicated as newfildes (as if
       dup2(fildes, newfildes) had been called) when a new process is
       spawned using this file actions object.
       A spawn file actions object is as defined in
       posix_spawn_file_actions_addclose(3p).
