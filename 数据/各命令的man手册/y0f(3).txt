       The y0() and y1() functions return Bessel functions of x of the
       second kind of orders 0 and 1, respectively.  The yn() function
       returns the Bessel function of x of the second kind of order n.
       The value of x must be positive.
       The y0f(), y1f(), and ynf() functions are versions that take and
       return float values.  The y0l(), y1l(), and ynl() functions are
       versions that take and return long double values.
