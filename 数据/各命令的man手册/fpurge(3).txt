       The function fpurge() clears the buffers of the given stream.  For
       output streams this discards any unwritten output.  For input streams
       this discards any input read from the underlying object but not yet
       obtained via getc(3); this includes any text pushed back via
       ungetc(3).  See also fflush(3).
       The function __fpurge() does precisely the same, but without
       returning a value.
