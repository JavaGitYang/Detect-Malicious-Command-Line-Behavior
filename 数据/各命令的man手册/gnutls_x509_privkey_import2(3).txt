       This function will import the given DER or PEM encoded key, to the
       native gnutls_x509_privkey_t format, irrespective of the input
       format. The input format is auto-detected.
       The supported formats are basic unencrypted key, PKCS8, PKCS12, and
       the openssl format.
       If the provided key is encrypted but no password was given, then
       GNUTLS_E_DECRYPTION_FAILED is returned. Since GnuTLS 3.4.0 this
       function will utilize the PIN callbacks if any.
