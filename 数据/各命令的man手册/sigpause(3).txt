       Don't use this function.  Use sigsuspend(2) instead.
       The function sigpause() is designed to wait for some signal.  It
       changes the process's signal mask (set of blocked signals), and then
       waits for a signal to arrive.  Upon arrival of a signal, the original
       signal mask is restored.
