       capng_updatev will update the internal posix capabilities settings
       based on the options passed to it. The action should be eith
       CAPNG_DROP to set the capability bit to 0, or CAPNG_ADD to set the
       capability bit to 1. The operation is performed on the capability set
       specified in the type parameter. The values are: CAPNG_EFFECTIVE,
       CAPNG_PERMITTED, CAPNG_INHERITABLE, CAPNG_BOUNDING_SET. The values
       may be or'ed together to perform the same operation on multiple sets.
       The last paramter, capability, is the capability define as given in

       This function differs from capng_update in that you may pass a list
       of capabilities. This list must be terminated with a -1 value.
