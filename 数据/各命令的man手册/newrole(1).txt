       Run a new shell in a new context.  The new context is derived from
       the old context in which newrole is originally executed.  If the -r
       or --role option is specified, then the new context will have the
       role specified by ROLE.  If the -t or --type option is specified,
       then the new context will have the type (domain) specified by TYPE.
       If a role is specified, but no type is specified, the default type is
       derived from the specified role.  If the -l or --level option is
       specified, then the new context will have the sensitivity level
       specified by LEVEL.  If LEVEL is a range, the new context will have
       the sensitivity level and clearance specified by that range.  If the
       -p or --preserve-environment option is specified, the shell with the
       new SELinux context will preserve environment variables, otherwise a
       new minimal enviroment is created.
       Additional arguments ARGS may be provided after a -- option, in which
       case they are supplied to the new shell.  In particular, an argument
       of -- -c will cause the next argument to be treated as a command by
       most command interpreters.
       If a command argument is specified to newrole and the command name is
       found in /etc/selinux/newrole_pam.conf, then the pam service name
       listed in that file for the command will be used rather than the
       normal newrole pam configuration.  This allows for per-command pam
       configuration when invoked via newrole, e.g. to skip the interactive
       re-authentication phase.
       The new shell will be the shell specified in the user's entry in the
       /etc/passwd file.
       The -V or --version shows the current version of newrole
