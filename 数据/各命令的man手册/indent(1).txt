       Edition  of "The indent Manual", for Indent Version , last updated .
       The indent program can be used to make code easier to read.  It can
       also convert from one style of writing C to another.
       indent understands a substantial amount about the syntax of C, but it
       also attempts to cope with incomplete and misformed syntax.
       In version 1.2 and more recent versions, the GNU style of indenting
       is the default.
