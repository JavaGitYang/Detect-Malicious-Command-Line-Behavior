       sctp_peeloff branches off an existing association assoc_id on a one-
       to-many style socket sd into a separate socket. The new socket is a
       one-to-one style socket.
       This is particularly desirable when, for instance, the application
       wishes to have a number of sporadic message senders/receivers remain
       under the original one-to-many style socket, but branch off those
       assocations carrying high volume data traffic into their own separate
       socket descriptors.
       sctp_peeloff_flags is a variant of sctp_peeloff, in which flags
       describing the behavior of the newly peeled off socket can be
       specified.  Currently the supported flags are:
       SOCK_NONBLOCK
              Specifies that the new socket should not block on io
              operations.
       SOCK_CLOEXEC
              Specifies that the new socket should be closed when the owning
              process calls exec.
