       semodule_expand is a developer tool for manually expanding a base
       policy module package into a kernel binary policy file.  This tool is
       not necessary for normal operation of SELinux.  In normal operation,
       such expanding is performed internally by libsemanage in response to
       semodule commands.  Base policy module packages can be created
       directly by semodule_package or by semodule_link (when linking
       together a set of packages into a single package).
