       This file contains default options for dselect. Each line contains a
       single option which is exactly the same as a normal command line
       option for dselect except for the leading hyphens which are not used
       here. Quotes surrounding option values are stripped. Comments are
       allowed by starting a line with a hash sign (‘#’).
