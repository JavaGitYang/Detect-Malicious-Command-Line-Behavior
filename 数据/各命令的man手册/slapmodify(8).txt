       Slapmodify is used to apply modifications specified in LDAP Directory
       Interchange Format (LDIF) to a slapd(8) database.  It opens the given
       database determined by the database number or suffix and performs
       modifications corresponding to the provided LDIF to the database.
       Databases configured as subordinate of this one are also updated,
       unless -g is specified.  The LDIF input is read from standard input
       or the specified file.
       All files eventually created by slapmodify will belong to the
       identity slapmodify is run as, so make sure you either run slapmodify
       with the same identity slapd(8) will be run as (see option -u in
       slapd(8)), or change file ownership before running slapd(8).
       Note: slapmodify will also perform the relevant indexing whilst
       modifying the database if any are configured. For specific details,
       please see slapindex(8).
