       The getusershell() function returns the next line from the file
       /etc/shells, opening the file if necessary.  The line should contain
       the pathname of a valid user shell.  If /etc/shells does not exist or
       is unreadable, getusershell() behaves as if /bin/sh and /bin/csh were
       listed in the file.
       The setusershell() function rewinds /etc/shells.
       The endusershell() function closes /etc/shells.
