       This function checks whether the type of scon is in the
       /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/context/customizable_types file.  A
       customizable type is a file context type that administrators set on
       files, usually to allow certain domains to share the file content.
       restorecon and setfiles, by default, leave these context in place.
