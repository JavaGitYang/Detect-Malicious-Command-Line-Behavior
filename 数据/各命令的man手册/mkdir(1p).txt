       The mkdir utility shall create the directories specified by the
       operands, in the order specified.
       For each dir operand, the mkdir utility shall perform actions
       equivalent to the mkdir() function defined in the System Interfaces
       volume of POSIX.1‐2008, called with the following arguments:
        1. The dir operand is used as the path argument.
        2. The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRWXU, S_IRWXG, and
           S_IRWXO is used as the mode argument. (If the −m option is
           specified, the value of the mkdir() mode argument is unspecified,
           but the directory shall at no time have permissions less
           restrictive than the −m mode option-argument.)
