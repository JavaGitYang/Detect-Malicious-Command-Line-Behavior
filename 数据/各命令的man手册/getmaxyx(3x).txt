       The getyx macro places the current cursor position of the given
       window in the two integer variables y and x.
       If win is a subwindow, the getparyx macro places the beginning
       coordinates of the subwindow relative to the parent window into two
       integer variables y and x.  Otherwise, -1 is placed into y and x.
       Like getyx, the getbegyx and getmaxyx macros store the current
       beginning coordinates and size of the specified window.
