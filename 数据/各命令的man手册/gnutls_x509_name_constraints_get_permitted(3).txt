       This function will return an intermediate type containing the name
       constraints of the provided CA certificate. That structure can be
       used in combination with gnutls_x509_name_constraints_check() to
       verify whether a server's name is in accordance with the constraints.
       The name should be treated as constant and valid for the lifetime of
       nc .
