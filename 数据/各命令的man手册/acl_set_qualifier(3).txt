     The acl_set_qualifier() function sets the qualifier of the ACL entry
     indicated by the argument entry_d to the value referred to by the argu‚Äê
     ment qualifier_p.  If the value of the tag type in the ACL entry
     referred to by entry_d is ACL_USER, then the value referred to by
     qualifier_p shall be of type uid_t.  If the value of the tag type in
     the ACL entry referred to by entry_d is ACL_GROUP, then the value
     referred to by qualifier_p shall be of type gid_t.  If the value of the
     tag type in the ACL entry referred to by entry_d is a tag type for
     which a qualifier is not supported, acl_set_qualifier() returns an
     error.
     Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to the entry referred to by
     entry_d continue to refer to that entry. This function may cause memory
     to be allocated. The caller should free any releasable memory, when the
     ACL is no longer required, by calling acl_free() with a pointer to the
     ACL as argument.
