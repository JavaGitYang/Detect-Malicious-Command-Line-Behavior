       The posix_spawnattr_getschedparam() function shall obtain the value
       of the spawn-schedparam attribute from the attributes object
       referenced by attr.
       The posix_spawnattr_setschedparam() function shall set the spawn-
       schedparam attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced
       by attr.
       The spawn-schedparam attribute represents the scheduling parameters
       to be assigned to the new process image in a spawn operation (if
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER or POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDPARAM is set in the
       spawn-flags attribute). The default value of this attribute is
       unspecified.
