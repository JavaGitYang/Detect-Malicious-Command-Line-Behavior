       The pam_loginuid module sets the loginuid process attribute for the
       process that was authenticated. This is necessary for applications to
       be correctly audited. This PAM module should only be used for entry
       point applications like: login, sshd, gdm, vsftpd, crond and atd.
       There are probably other entry point applications besides these. You
       should not use it for applications like sudo or su as that defeats
       the purpose by changing the loginuid to the account they just
       switched to.
