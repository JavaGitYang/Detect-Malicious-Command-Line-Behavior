       The pam_sepermit module allows or denies login depending on SELinux
       enforcement state.
       When the user which is logging in matches an entry in the config file
       he is allowed access only when the SELinux is in enforcing mode.
       Otherwise he is denied access. For users not matching any entry in
       the config file the pam_sepermit module returns PAM_IGNORE return
       value.
       The config file contains a list of user names one per line with
       optional arguments. If the name is prefixed with @ character it means
       that all users in the group name match. If it is prefixed with a %
       character the SELinux user is used to match against the name instead
       of the account name. Note that when SELinux is disabled the SELinux
       user assigned to the account cannot be determined. This means that
       such entries are never matched when SELinux is disabled and
       pam_sepermit will return PAM_IGNORE.
       See sepermit.conf(5) for details.
