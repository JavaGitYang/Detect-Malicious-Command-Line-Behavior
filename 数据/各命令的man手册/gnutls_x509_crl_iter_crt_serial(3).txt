       This function performs the same as gnutls_x509_crl_get_crt_serial(),
       but reads sequentially and keeps state in the iterator between calls.
       That allows it to provide better performance in sequences with many
       elements (50000+).
       When past the last element is accessed
       GNUTLS_E_REQUESTED_DATA_NOT_AVAILABLE is returned and the iterator is
       reset.
       After use, the iterator must be deinitialized using
       gnutls_x509_crl_iter_deinit().
