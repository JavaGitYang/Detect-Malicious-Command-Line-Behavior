       To report MariaDB bugs, see
       https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb/reporting-bugs/ - the mysqlbug
       program has now been deprecated by Oracle, and was never useful for
       MariaDB.
       Originally, the program enabled you to generate a bug report and send
       it to Oracle Corporation. It is a shell script and runs on Unix.
       The normal way to report MySQL bugs is to visit
       http://bugs.mysql.com/ , which is the address for MySQL's bugs
       database. This database is public and can be browsed and searched by
       anyone. If you log in to the system, you can enter new reports. If
       you have no Web access, you can generate a bug report by using the
       mysqlbug script.
       mysqlbug helps you generate a report by determining much of the
       following information automatically, but if something important is
       missing, please include it with your message.  mysqlbug can be found
       in the scripts directory (source distribution) and in the bin
       directory under your MySQL installation directory (binary
       distribution).
       Invoke mysqlbug without arguments:
           shell> mysqlbug
       The script will place you in an editor with a copy of the report to
       be sent. Edit the lines near the beginning that indicate the nature
       of the problem. Then write the file to save your changes, quit the
       editor, and mysqlbug will send the report by email.
