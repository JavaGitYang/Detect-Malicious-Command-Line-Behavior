       Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes that
       were previously generated by btrfs send. The received subvolumes are
       stored to path, unless --dump option is given.
       If --dump option is specified, btrfs receive will only do the
       validation of the stream, and print the stream metadata, one
       operation per line.
       btrfs receive will fail in the following cases:
        1. receiving subvolume already exists
        2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was
           received
        3. default subvolume has changed or you didnâ€™t mount the filesystem
           at the toplevel subvolume
       A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process finishes
       successfully (see BUGS below).
       Options
       -v
           increase verbosity about performed actions, print details about
           each operation
       -f <FILE>
           read the stream from <FILE> instead of stdin,
       -C|--chroot
           confine the process to path using chroot(1)
       -e
           terminate after receiving an end cmd marker in the stream.
           Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case of
           an error on end of file.
       -E|--max-errors <NERR>
           terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream processing
           commands from the stream
           Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.
       -m <ROOTMOUNT>
           the root mount point of the destination filesystem
           By default the mountpoint is searched in /proc/self/mounts. If
           /proc is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use this
           option to tell us where this filesystem is mounted.
       --dump
           dump the stream metadata, one line per operation
           Does not require the path parameter. The filesystem remains
           unchanged.
