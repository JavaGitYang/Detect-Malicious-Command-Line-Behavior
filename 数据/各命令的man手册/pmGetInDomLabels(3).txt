       Labels are name:value pairs associated with performance metric values
       for the purpose of attaching additional metric metadata to values.
       This metadata is less structured and exists separately to the metric
       descriptor available for every PCP metric from pmLookupDesc(3).
       Much like the metric descriptor metadata, labels are an integral part
       of the identity of each metric, and should rarely, if ever, change.
       The pmLookupLabels routine is a convenience interface providing
       retrieval for all labels associated with a single performance metric
       identifier, pmid.  It performs no caching of labels internally.
       For efficiency in communication and storage within the various
       components of the PMCS (Performance Metrics Collection System),
       labels are maintained using a hierarchy.  The set of labels
       associated with any individual metric value consists of the union of
       labels from each of these sets of labels:
       1. Global labels (apply to all metric values from a host or archive
       context)
       pmGetContextLabels
               provides the labelset associated with all metric values from
               a given source (PMAPI context).
       2. Domain labels (apply to every metric within a PMDA)
       pmGetDomainLabels
               provides the labelset associated with the domain identifier.
       3. Instance Domain labels (apply to all metrics sharing that indom)
       pmGetInDomLabels
               provides the labelset associated with the instance domain
               identifier indom.
       4. Cluster labels (apply to a group of metrics within one domain)
       pmGetClusterLabels
               provides the labelset associated with the metric cluster
               (domain,cluster) identified by pmid.
       5. Item labels (apply to an individual performance metric)
       pmGetItemLabels
               provides the labelset associated with the metric item
               (domain,cluster,item) identified by pmid.
       6. Instance labels (apply to individual instances of a metric)
       pmGetInstancesLabels
               provides the set of instance identifiers and labels in
               labelsets for each instance associated with the instance
               domain identifier indom.  The return value indicates the
               number of elements in the result - one labelset for each
               instance.
       These independent labelsets can be merged using pmMergeLabelSets(3)
       to form the complete set of all labels associated with a given value.
