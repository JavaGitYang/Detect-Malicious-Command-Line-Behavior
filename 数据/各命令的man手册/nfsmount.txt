       The configuration file is made up of multiple sections followed by
       variables associated with that section.  A section is defined by a
       string enclosed by [ and ] branches.  Variables are assignment
       statements that assign values to particular variables using the =
       operator, as in Proto=Tcp.  The variables that can be assigned are
       exactly the set of NFS specific mount options listed in nfs(5).
       Sections are broken up into three basic categories: Global options,
       Server options and Mount Point options.
       [ NFSMount_Global_Options ] - This statically named section defines
              all of the global mount options that can be applied to every
              NFS mount.
       [ Server “Server_Name” ] - This section defines all the mount options
              that should be used on mounts to a particular NFS server. The
              “Server_Name” strings needs to be surrounded by '“' and be an
              exact match of the server name used in the mount command.
       [ MountPoint “Mount_Point” ] - This section defines all the mount
              options that should be used on a particular mount point.  The
              “Mount_Point” string needs to be surrounded by '“' and be an
              exact match of the mount point used in the mount command.
