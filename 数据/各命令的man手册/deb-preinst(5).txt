       A package can perform several pre-installation actions via maintainer
       scripts, by including an executable preinst file in its control
       archive (i.e. DEBIAN/preinst during package creation).
       The script can be called in the following ways:
       new-preinst install
              Before the package is installed.
       new-preinst install old-version new-version
              Before removed package is upgraded.
       new-preinst upgrade old-version new-version
              Before the package is upgraded.
       old-preinst abort-upgrade new-version
              If postrm fails during upgrade or fails on failed upgrade.
