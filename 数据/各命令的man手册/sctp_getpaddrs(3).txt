       sctp_getpaddrs returns all peer addresses in an association. On
       return, addrs will point to a dynamically allocated packed array of
       sockaddr structures of the appropriate type for each address. The
       caller should use sctp_freepaddrs to free the memory. Note that the
       in/out parameter addrs must not be NULL.
       If sd is an IPv4 socket, the addresses returned will be all IPv4
       addresses. If sd is an IPv6 socket, the addresses returned can be a
       mix of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.
       For one-to-many style sockets, id specifies the association to query.
       For one-to-one style sockets, id is ignored.
       sctp_freepaddrs frees all the resources allocated by sctp_getpaddrs.
