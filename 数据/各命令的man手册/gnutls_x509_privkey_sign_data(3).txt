       This function will sign the given data using a signature algorithm
       supported by the private key. Signature algorithms are always used
       together with a hash functions.  Different hash functions may be used
       for the RSA algorithm, but only SHA-1 for the DSA keys.
       If the buffer provided is not long enough to hold the output, then *
       signature_size is updated and GNUTLS_E_SHORT_MEMORY_BUFFER will be
       returned.
       Use gnutls_x509_crt_get_preferred_hash_algorithm() to determine the
       hash algorithm.
