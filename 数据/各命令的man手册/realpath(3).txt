       realpath() expands all symbolic links and resolves references to /./,
       /../ and extra '/' characters in the null-terminated string named by
       path to produce a canonicalized absolute pathname.  The resulting
       pathname is stored as a null-terminated string, up to a maximum of
       PATH_MAX bytes, in the buffer pointed to by resolved_path.  The
       resulting path will have no symbolic link, /./ or /../ components.
       If resolved_path is specified as NULL, then realpath() uses malloc(3)
       to allocate a buffer of up to PATH_MAX bytes to hold the resolved
       pathname, and returns a pointer to this buffer.  The caller should
       deallocate this buffer using free(3).
