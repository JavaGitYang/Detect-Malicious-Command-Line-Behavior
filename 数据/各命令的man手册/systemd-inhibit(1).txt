       systemd-inhibit may be used to execute a program with a shutdown,
       sleep, or idle inhibitor lock taken. The lock will be acquired before
       the specified command line is executed and released afterwards.
       Inhibitor locks may be used to block or delay system sleep and
       shutdown requests from the user, as well as automatic idle handling
       of the OS. This is useful to avoid system suspends while an optical
       disc is being recorded, or similar operations that should not be
       interrupted.
       For more information see the Inhibitor Lock Developer
       Documentation[1].
