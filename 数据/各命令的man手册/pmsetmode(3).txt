       pmSetMode is used to define the collection time and/or mode for
       accessing performance metrics and meta-data in the current
       Performance Metrics Application Programming Interface (PMAPI)
       context.  This mode affects the semantics of subsequent calls to the
       following PMAPI routines: pmFetch(3), pmFetchArchive(3),
       pmLookupDesc(3), pmGetInDom(3), pmLookupInDom(3) and pmNameInDom(3).
       If mode is PM_MODE_LIVE then all information is returned from the
       active pool of performance metrics as of the time that the PMAPI call
       is made, and the other two parameters to pmSetMode are ignored.
       PM_MODE_LIVE is the default mode when a new PMAPI context of type
       PM_CONTEXT_HOST is created.
       If the mode is not PM_MODE_LIVE, then the when parameter defines a
       time origin, and all requests for meta-data (metric descriptions and
       instance identifiers from the instance domains) will be processed to
       reflect the state of the meta-data as of the time origin, i.e. we use
       the last state of this information at, or before, the time origin.
       If the mode is PM_MODE_INTERP then, in the case of pmFetch(3), the
       underlying code will use an interpolation scheme to compute the
       values of the metrics from the values recorded for times in the
       proximity of the time origin.  A mode of PM_MODE_INTERP may only be
       used with an archive context.
       If the mode is PM_MODE_FORW then, in the case of pmFetch(3), the
       collection of recorded metric values will be scanned in a forwards
       direction in time, until values for at least one of the requested
       metrics is located after the time origin, and then all requested
       metrics stored in the set of archives at that time will be returned
       with the corresponding timestamp.  A mode of PM_MODE_FORW may only be
       used with an archive context.
       If the mode is PM_MODE_BACK then, the situation is the same as for
       PM_MODE_FORW, except a pmFetch(3) will be serviced by scanning the
       collection of recorded metrics in a backwards direction in time for
       metrics before the time origin.  A mode of PM_MODE_BACK may only be
       used with an archive context.
       If the mode is PM_MODE_FORW or PM_MODE_BACK, and no qualifying
       metrics can be found in the requested direction of searching before
       the end or start of the set of archive logs is found, then pmFetch(3)
       returns the special error indicator, PM_ERR_EOL.
       For modes other than PM_MODE_LIVE, after each successful pmFetch(3),
       the time origin is reset to the timestamp returned via the pmResult
       structure from pmFetch(3).
       The pmSetMode parameter delta defines an additional number of time
       units that should be used to adjust the time origin (forwards or
       backwards), after the new time origin from the pmResult has been
       determined.  This automatic adjustment of the time origin only occurs
       when the mode is PM_MODE_INTERP, and the adjustment is applied, even
       if the pmFetch(3) fails because the time origin is outside the range
       defined by the records in a set of archive logs, i.e. returns
       PM_ERR_EOL.
       By default delta is interpreted as milliseconds (but see the LARGE
       DELTA VALUES section below).
       Using these mode options, an application can implement replay,
       playback, fast forward, reverse, etc. for performance metric values
       held in the set of archive logs by alternating calls to pmSetMode and
       pmFetch(3).
       As a special case, if when is NULL then the mode and delta arguments
       are used as described above, but the current time in the archive is
       not altered.
