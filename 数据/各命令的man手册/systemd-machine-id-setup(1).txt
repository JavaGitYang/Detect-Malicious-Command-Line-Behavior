       systemd-machine-id-setup may be used by system installer tools to
       initialize the machine ID stored in /etc/machine-id at install time,
       with a provisioned or randomly generated ID. See machine-id(5) for
       more information about this file.
       If the tool is invoked without the --commit switch, /etc/machine-id
       is initialized with a valid, new machined ID if it is missing or
       empty. The new machine ID will be acquired in the following fashion:
        1. If a valid D-Bus machine ID is already configured for the system,
           the D-Bus machine ID is copied and used to initialize the machine
           ID in /etc/machine-id.
        2. If run inside a KVM virtual machine and a UUID is configured (via
           the -uuid option), this UUID is used to initialize the machine
           ID. The caller must ensure that the UUID passed is sufficiently
           unique and is different for every booted instance of the VM.
        3. Similarly, if run inside a Linux container environment and a UUID
           is configured for the container, this is used to initialize the
           machine ID. For details, see the documentation of the Container
           Interface[1].
        4. Otherwise, a new ID is randomly generated.
       The --commit switch may be used to commit a transient machined ID to
       disk, making it persistent. For details, see below.
       Use systemd-firstboot(1) to initialize the machine ID on mounted (but
       not booted) system images.
