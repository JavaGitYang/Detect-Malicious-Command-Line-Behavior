       This function has the similar semantics with recv().  The only
       difference is that it accepts a GnuTLS session, and uses different
       error codes.  In the special case that the peer requests a
       renegotiation, the caller will receive an error code of
       GNUTLS_E_REHANDSHAKE.  In case of a client, this message may be
       simply ignored, replied with an alert GNUTLS_A_NO_RENEGOTIATION, or
       replied with a new handshake, depending on the client's will. A
       server receiving this error code can only initiate a new handshake or
       terminate the session.
       If EINTR is returned by the internal pull function (the default is
       recv()) then GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED will be returned.  If
       GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED or GNUTLS_E_AGAIN is returned, you must call
       this function again to get the data.  See also
       gnutls_record_get_direction().
