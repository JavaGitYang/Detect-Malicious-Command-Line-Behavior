       The aio_fsync() function shall asynchronously perform a file
       synchronization operation, as specified by the op argument, for I/O
       operations associated with the file indicated by the file descriptor
       aio_fildes member of the aiocb structure referenced by the aiocbp
       argument and queued at the time of the call to aio_fsync().  The
       function call shall return when the synchronization request has been
       initiated or queued to the file or device (even when the data cannot
       be synchronized immediately).
       If op is O_DSYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be
       completed as if by a call to fdatasync(); that is, as defined for
       synchronized I/O data integrity completion.
       If op is O_SYNC, all currently queued I/O operations shall be
       completed as if by a call to fsync(); that is, as defined for
       synchronized I/O file integrity completion.  If the aio_fsync()
       function fails, or if the operation queued by aio_fsync() fails, then
       outstanding I/O operations are not guaranteed to have been completed.
       If aio_fsync() succeeds, then it is only the I/O that was queued at
       the time of the call to aio_fsync() that is guaranteed to be forced
       to the relevant completion state. The completion of subsequent I/O on
       the file descriptor is not guaranteed to be completed in a
       synchronized fashion.
       The aiocbp argument refers to an asynchronous I/O control block. The
       aiocbp value may be used as an argument to aio_error() and
       aio_return() in order to determine the error status and return
       status, respectively, of the asynchronous operation while it is
       proceeding. When the request is queued, the error status for the
       operation is [EINPROGRESS].  When all data has been successfully
       transferred, the error status shall be reset to reflect the success
       or failure of the operation. If the operation does not complete
       successfully, the error status for the operation shall be set to
       indicate the error. The aio_sigevent member determines the
       asynchronous notification to occur as specified in Section 2.4.1,
       Signal Generation and Delivery when all operations have achieved
       synchronized I/O completion. All other members of the structure
       referenced by aiocbp are ignored. If the control block referenced by
       aiocbp becomes an illegal address prior to asynchronous I/O
       completion, then the behavior is undefined.
       If the aio_fsync() function fails or aiocbp indicates an error
       condition, data is not guaranteed to have been successfully
       transferred.
