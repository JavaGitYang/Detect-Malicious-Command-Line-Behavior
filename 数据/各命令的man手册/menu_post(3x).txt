       The function post_menu displays a menu to its associated subwindow.
       To trigger physical display of the subwindow, use refresh(3X) or some
       equivalent curses routine (the implicit doupdate triggered by an
       curses input request will do). post_menu resets the selection status
       of all items.
       The function unpost_menu erases menu from its associated subwindow.
