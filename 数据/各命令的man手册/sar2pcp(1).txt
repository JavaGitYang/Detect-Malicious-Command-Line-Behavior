       sar2pcp is intended to read a binary System Activity Reporting (sar)
       data file as created by sadc(1) (infile) and translate this into a
       Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename outfile.
       However, if infile has the suffix ``.xml'', then it will be
       considered already in XML format and sar2pcp will operate directly on
       it.
       The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client tools to
       graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data reduction
       and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine pmie(1), etc.
       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix outfile.
       These are outfile.0 (the performance data), outfile.meta (the
       metadata that describes the performance data) and outfile.index (a
       temporal index to improve efficiency of replay operations for the
       archive).  If any of these files exists already, then sar2pcp will
       not overwrite them and will exit with an error message of the form
       __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written
       sar2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper
       around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could be used as an
       example to develop new tools to import other types of performance
       data and create PCP archives.  A Python wrapper module is also
       available.
