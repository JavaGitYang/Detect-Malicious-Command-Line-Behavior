       pmSetProcessIdentity provides a platform-independent method to set
       the user id of a process to that matching username.
       If possible (when the caller is already running as root)
       pmSetProcessIdentity will set the group id of the process to that of
       the matching user, e.g. using username and getpwnam(3).
       A return value of 0 indicates success, otherwise the return value is
       an error code that may be decoded with pmErrStr(3).
       pmSetProcessIdentity is most often used in conjunction with
       pmGetUsername(3) at process start up.
