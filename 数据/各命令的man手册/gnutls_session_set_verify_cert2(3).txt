       This function instructs GnuTLS to verify the peer's certificate using
       the provided typed data information. If the verification fails the
       handshake will also fail with
       GNUTLS_E_CERTIFICATE_VERIFICATION_ERROR. In that case the
       verification result can be obtained using
       gnutls_session_get_verify_cert_status().
       The acceptable typed data are the same as in
       gnutls_certificate_verify_peers(), and once set must remain valid for
       the lifetime of the session. More precisely they should be available
       during any subsequent handshakes.
       If  flags is provided which contain a profile, this function should
       be called after any session priority setting functions.
