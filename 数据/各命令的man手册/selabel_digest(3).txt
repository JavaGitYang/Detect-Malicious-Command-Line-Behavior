       selabel_digest() performs an operation on the handle hnd, returning
       the results of the SHA1 digest pointed to by digest, whose length
       will be digest_len.  The list of specfiles used in the SHA1 digest
       calculation is returned in specfiles with the number of entries in
       num_specfiles.
       To enable selabel_digest() to return this information the
       SELABEL_OPT_DIGEST option must be enable in selabel_open(3).
       The result of selabel_digest() must not be used after
       selabel_close(3).
