       Using this function you can override the default writev(2) function
       for gnutls to send data. Setting this callback instead of
       gnutls_transport_set_push_function() is recommended since it
       introduces less overhead in the TLS handshake process.
        vec_func is of the form, ssize_t (*gnutls_vec_push_func)
       (gnutls_transport_ptr_t, const giovec_t * iov, int iovcnt);
