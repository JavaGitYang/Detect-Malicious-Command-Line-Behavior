       The sigsetjmp() function shall be equivalent to the setjmp()
       function, except as follows:
        *  References to setjmp() are equivalent to sigsetjmp().
        *  References to longjmp() are equivalent to siglongjmp().
        *  If the value of the savemask argument is not 0, sigsetjmp() shall
           also save the current signal mask of the calling thread as part
           of the calling environment.
