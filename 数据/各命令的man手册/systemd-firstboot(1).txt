       systemd-firstboot initializes the most basic system settings
       interactively on the first boot, or optionally non-interactively when
       a system image is created. The service is started if
       ConditionFirstBoot=yes is satisfied. This essentially means that /etc
       is empty, see systemd.unit(5) for details.
       The following settings may be set up:
       ·   The system locale, more specifically the two locale variables
           LANG= and LC_MESSAGES
       ·   The system time zone
       ·   The system host name
       ·   The machine ID of the system
       ·   The root user's password
       Each of the fields may either be queried interactively by users, set
       non-interactively on the tool's command line, or be copied from a
       host system that is used to set up the system image.
       If a setting is already initialized, it will not be overwritten and
       the user will not be prompted for the setting.
       Note that this tool operates directly on the file system and does not
       involve any running system services, unlike localectl(1),
       timedatectl(1) or hostnamectl(1). This allows systemd-firstboot to
       operate on mounted but not booted disk images and in early boot. It
       is not recommended to use systemd-firstboot on the running system
       while it is up.
