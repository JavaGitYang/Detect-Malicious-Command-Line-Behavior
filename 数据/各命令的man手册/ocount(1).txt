       ocount is an OProfile tool that can be used to count native hardware
       events occurring in either a given application, a set of processes or
       threads, a subset of active system processors, or the entire system.
       The data collected during a counting session is displayed to stdout
       by default or, optionally, to a file.
       When counting multiple events, the kernel may not be able to count
       all events simultaneously and, thus, may need to multiplex the
       counting of the events.  If this happens, the "Percent time enabled"
       column in the ocount output will be less than 100, but counts are
       scaled up to a 100% estimated value.
