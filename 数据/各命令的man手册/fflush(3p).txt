       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       If stream points to an output stream or an update stream in which the
       most recent operation was not input, fflush() shall cause any
       unwritten data for that stream to be written to the file, and the
       last data modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       underlying file shall be marked for update.
       If stream is a null pointer, fflush() shall perform this flushing
       action on all streams for which the behavior is defined above.
       For a stream open for reading, if the file is not already at EOF, and
       the file is one capable of seeking, the file offset of the underlying
       open file description shall be set to the file position of the
       stream, and any characters pushed back onto the stream by ungetc() or
       ungetwc() that have not subsequently been read from the stream shall
       be discarded (without further changing the file offset).
