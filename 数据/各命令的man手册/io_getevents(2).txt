       The io_getevents() system call attempts to read at least min_nr
       events and up to nr events from the completion queue of the AIO
       context specified by ctx_id.
       The timeout argument specifies the amount of time to wait for events,
       and is specified as a relative timeout in a structure of the
       following form:
           struct timespec {
               time_t tv_sec;      /* seconds */
               long   tv_nsec;     /* nanoseconds [0 .. 999999999] */
           };
       The specified time will be rounded up to the system clock granularity
       and is guaranteed not to expire     early.
       Specifying timeout as NULL means block indefinitely until at least
       min_nr events have been obtained.
