       This function sets a certificate/private key pair in the
       gnutls_certificate_credentials_t type.  This function may be called
       more than once, in case multiple keys/certificates exist for the
       server.  For clients that need to send more than its own end entity
       certificate, e.g., also an intermediate CA cert, then the
        certfile must contain the ordered certificate chain.
       Note that the names in the certificate provided will be considered
       when selecting the appropriate certificate to use (in case of
       multiple certificate/key pairs).
       This function can also accept URLs at  keyfile and  certfile . In
       that case it will use the private key and certificate indicated by
       the URLs. Note that the supported URLs are the ones indicated by
       gnutls_url_is_supported().
       In case the  certfile is provided as a PKCS 11 URL, then the
       certificate, and its present issuers in the token are imported (i.e.,
       forming the required trust chain).
       If that function fails to load the  res structure is at an undefined
       state, it must not be reused to load other keys or certificates.
       Note that, this function by default returns zero on success and a
       negative value on error.  Since 3.5.6, when the flag
       GNUTLS_CERTIFICATE_API_V2 is set using gnutls_certificate_set_flags()
       it returns an index (greater or equal to zero). That index can be
       used to other functions to refer to the added key-pair.
