       The following sections enumerate the public variables provided by
       standard tapsets installed, (the installation path is show in the
       stappaths (7) manual page).  Each variable is described with a type,
       and its behavior/restrictions.  The syntax is the same as printed
       with the stap option -p2.  Examples:
       example1:long
              Variable "example1" contains an integer.
       example2:string [long]
              Variable "example2" is an array of strings, indexed by
              integers.
   ARGV
       argc:long
              Contains the value of the  $# value: the number of command
              line arguments passed to the systemtap script.  It is
              initialized with an implicit begin(-1) probe.
       argv:string [long]
              Contains each command line argument as a string.  argv[1] will
              equal @1 if there was at least one command line argument.
              Arguments beyond #32 are not transcribed, and produce a
              warning message within the begin(-1) probe that initializes
              this array.
   NULL
       NULL:long
              Simply defined as the number 0.
