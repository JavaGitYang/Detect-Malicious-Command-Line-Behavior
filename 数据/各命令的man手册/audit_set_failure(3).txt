       audit_set_failure sets the action that the kernel will perform when
       the backlog limit is reached or when it encounters an error and
       cannot proceed. Possible values are:
       0 - AUDIT_FAIL_SILENT
              Do nothing, report nothing, skip logging the record and
              continue.
       1 - AUDIT_FAIL_PRINTK [default]
              Log the audit record using printk which will cause subsequent
              events to get written to syslog.
       2 - AUDIT_FAIL_PANIC
              Call the panic function. This would be used to prevent use of
              the machine upon loss of audit events.
