       This manual page documents briefly the lnstat command.
       lnstat is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for the
       old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print a
       selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In addition
       to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of statistics the
       linux kernel exports via a file in /proc/net/stat/.
       Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the
       column names.  These names are used by lnstat as keys for selecting
       which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the system, a
       line follows which lists the actual values for each column of the
       file. lnstat sums these values up (which in fact are counters) before
       printing them. After each interval, only the difference to the last
       value is printed.
       Files and columns may be selected by using the -f and -k parameters.
       By default, all columns of all files are printed.
