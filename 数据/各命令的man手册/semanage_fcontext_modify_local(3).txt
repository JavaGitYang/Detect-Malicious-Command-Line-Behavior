       Behavior:
              If a matching key is found in the local store, the provided
              object will replace the current one. Otherwise, it will be
              added to the store. When semanage_commit(3) is invoked,
              changes will be permanently written into the local store, and
              then loaded into policy. Validity of the object being added is
              checked at commit time. Adding new objects with respect to
              policy is allowed, except in the case of booleans. Attempt to
              add new booleans with respect to policy will fail at commit
              time.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The key identifies the data
              object, which will be written into the store. The key are data
              are properties of the caller, and are not stored or modified
              internally.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) ), and must be executed
              in a transaction (see semanage_begin_transaction(3) ).
