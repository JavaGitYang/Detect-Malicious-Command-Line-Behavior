       The s390_runtime_instr() system call starts or stops CPU run-time
       instrumentation for the calling thread.
       The command argument controls whether run-time instrumentation is
       started (S390_RUNTIME_INSTR_START, 1) or stopped
       (S390_RUNTIME_INSTR_STOP, 2) for the calling thread.
       The signum argument specifies the number of a real-time signal.  The
       real-time signal is sent to the thread if the run-time
       instrumentation buffer is full or if the run-time-instrumentation-
       halted interrupt occurred.
