       systemd-sysusers creates system users and groups, based on the file
       format and location specified in sysusers.d(5).
       If invoked with no arguments, it applies all directives from all
       files found. If one or more filenames are passed on the command line,
       only the directives in these files are applied. If only the basename
       of a file is specified, all directories as specified in sysusers.d(5)
       are searched for a matching file. If the string - is specified as
       filename, entries from the standard input of the process are read.
