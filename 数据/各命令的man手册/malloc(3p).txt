       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The malloc() function shall allocate unused space for an object whose
       size in bytes is specified by size and whose value is unspecified.
       The order and contiguity of storage allocated by successive calls to
       malloc() is unspecified. The pointer returned if the allocation
       succeeds shall be suitably aligned so that it may be assigned to a
       pointer to any type of object and then used to access such an object
       in the space allocated (until the space is explicitly freed or
       reallocated). Each such allocation shall yield a pointer to an object
       disjoint from any other object. The pointer returned points to the
       start (lowest byte address) of the allocated space. If the space
       cannot be allocated, a null pointer shall be returned. If the size of
       the space requested is 0, the behavior is implementation-defined: the
       value returned shall be either a null pointer or a unique pointer.
