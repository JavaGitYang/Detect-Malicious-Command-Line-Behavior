       For wcsxfrm(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wcsxfrm() and wcsxfrm_l() functions shall transform the wide-
       character string pointed to by ws2 and place the resulting wide-
       character string into the array pointed to by ws1.  The
       transformation shall be such that if wcscmp() is applied to two
       transformed wide strings, it shall return a value greater than, equal
       to, or less than 0, corresponding to the result of wcscoll() and
       wcscoll_l() applied to the same two original wide-character strings,
       and the same LC_COLLATE category of the current locale or the locale
       object locale, respectively. No more than n wide-character codes
       shall be placed into the resulting array pointed to by ws1, including
       the terminating null wide-character code. If n is 0, ws1 is permitted
       to be a null pointer. If copying takes place between objects that
       overlap, the behavior is undefined.
       The wcsxfrm() and wcsxfrm_l() functions shall not change the setting
       of errno if successful.
       Since no return value is reserved to indicate an error, an
       application wishing to check for error situations should set errno to
       0, then call wcsxfrm() or wcsxfrm_l(), then check errno.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wcsxfrm_l() is
       the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
