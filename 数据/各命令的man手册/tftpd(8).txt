       tftpd is a server which supports the DARPA Trivial File Transfer
       Protocol (RFC1350). The TFTP server is started by inetd(8).
       directory is required argument; if it is not given tftpd aborts. This
       path is prepended to any file name requested via TFTP protocol,
       effectively chrooting tftpd to this directory. File names are
       validated not to escape out of this directory, however administrator
       may configure such escape using symbolic links.
       It is in difference of variants of tftpd usually distributed with
       unix-like systems, which take a list of directories and match file
       names to start from one of given prefixes or to some random default,
       when no arguments were given. There are two reasons not to behave in
       this way: first, it is inconvenient, clients are not expected to know
       something about layout of filesystem on server host. And second, TFTP
       protocol is not a tool for browsing of server's filesystem, it is
       just an agent allowing to boot dumb clients.
       In the case when tftpd is used together with rarpd(8), tftp
       directories in these services should coincide and it is expected that
       each client booted via TFTP has boot image corresponding its IP
       address with an architecture suffix following Sun Microsystems
       conventions. See rarpd(8) for more details.
