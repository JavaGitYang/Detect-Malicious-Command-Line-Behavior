       The bc utility shall implement an arbitrary precision calculator. It
       shall take input from any files given, then read from the standard
       input. If the standard input and standard output to bc are attached
       to a terminal, the invocation of bc shall be considered to be
       interactive, causing behavioral constraints described in the
       following sections.
