       Applies the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF) on the master secret and
       the provided data, seeded with the client and server random fields.
       For the key expansion specified in RFC5705 see gnutls_prf_rfc5705().
       The  label variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
       for the generated data.  The  server_random_first indicates whether
       the client random field or the server random field should be first in
       the seed.  Non-zero indicates that the server random field is first,
       0 that the client random field is first.
       The  extra variable can be used to add more data to the seed, after
       the random variables.  It can be used to make sure the generated
       output is strongly connected to some additional data (e.g., a string
       used in user authentication).
       The output is placed in  out , which must be pre-allocated.
