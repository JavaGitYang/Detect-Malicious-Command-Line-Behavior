       This function will associate the given callbacks with the
       gnutls_privkey_t type. At least one of the two callbacks must be
       non-null.
       Note that the signing function is supposed to "raw" sign data, i.e.,
       without any hashing or preprocessing. In case of RSA the DigestInfo
       will be provided, and the signing function is expected to do the PKCS
       1 1.5 padding and the exponentiation.
       See also gnutls_privkey_import_ext3().
