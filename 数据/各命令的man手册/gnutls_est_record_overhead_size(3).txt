       This function will return the set size in bytes of the overhead due
       to TLS (or DTLS) per record.
       Note that this function may provide inacurate values when TLS
       extensions that modify the record format are negotiated. In these
       cases a more accurate value can be obtained using
       gnutls_record_overhead_size() after a completed handshake.
