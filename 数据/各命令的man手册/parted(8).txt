       parted is a program to manipulate disk partitions.  It supports
       multiple partition table formats, including MS-DOS and GPT.  It is
       useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganising
       disk usage, and copying data to new hard disks.
       This manual page documents parted briefly.  Complete documentation is
       distributed with the package in GNU Info format.
