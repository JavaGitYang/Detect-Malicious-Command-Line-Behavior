       The ldap_modrdn() and ldap_modrdn_s() routines perform an LDAP modify
       RDN operation.  They both take dn, the DN of the entry whose RDN is
       to be changed, and newrdn, the new RDN to give the entry.  The old
       RDN of the entry is never kept as an attribute of the entry.
       ldap_modrdn() is asynchronous, returning the message id of the
       operation it initiates.  ldap_modrdn_s() is synchronous, returning
       the LDAP error code indicating the success or failure of the
       operation.  Use of these routines is deprecated.  Use the versions
       described below instead.
       The ldap_modrdn2() and ldap_modrdn2_s() routines also perform an LDAP
       modify RDN operation, taking the same parameters as above.  In
       addition, they both take the deleteoldrdn parameter which is used as
       a boolean value to indicate whether the old RDN values should be
       deleted from the entry or not.
