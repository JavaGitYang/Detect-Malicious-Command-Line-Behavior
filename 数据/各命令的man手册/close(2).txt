       close() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any
       file and may be reused.  Any record locks (see fcntl(2)) held on the
       file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed
       (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).
       If fd is the last file descriptor referring to the underlying open
       file description (see open(2)), the resources associated with the
       open file description are freed; if the file descriptor was the last
       reference to a file which has been removed using unlink(2), the file
       is deleted.
