       These functions shall compute the quotient and remainder of the
       division of the numerator numer by the denominator denom.  If the
       division is inexact, the resulting quotient is the long integer (for
       the ldiv() function) or long long integer (for the lldiv() function)
       of lesser magnitude that is the nearest to the algebraic quotient. If
       the result cannot be represented, the behavior is undefined;
       otherwise, quot * denom+rem shall equal numer.
