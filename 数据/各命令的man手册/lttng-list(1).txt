       The lttng list command lists tracing sessions, tracing domains,
       channels, and events.
       Without arguments, lttng list lists the existing tracing sessions and
       shows if they are active or not.
       With one or more of the --kernel, --userspace, --jul, --log4j, and
       --python domain options, the command lists the available event
       sources of the selected domain on the system. The JUL, log4j, and
       Python domains list the names of their available loggers. The
       --syscall option can be used alongside the --kernel option to get a
       list of traceable Linux system calls. The --fields option can be used
       to show the fields of the listed event sources.
       Providing a tracing session name SESSION targets a specific tracing
       session. If the --domain option is used, domains containing at least
       one channel in the selected tracing session are listed. Otherwise,
       all the domains, channels, and event rules of the selected tracing
       session are listed along with its details (trace path, for example),
       except when the --channel option is used to isolate a specific
       channel by name.
