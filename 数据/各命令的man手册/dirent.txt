       The internal format of directories is unspecified.
       The <dirent.h> header shall define the following type:
       DIR     A type representing a directory stream. The DIR type may be
               an incomplete type.
       It shall also define the structure dirent which shall include the
       following members:
           ino_t  d_ino       File serial number.
           char   d_name[]    Filename string of entry.
       The <dirent.h> header shall define the ino_t type as described in
       <sys/types.h>.
       The array d_name is of unspecified size, but shall contain a filename
       of at most {NAME_MAX} bytes followed by a terminating null byte.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           int            alphasort(const struct dirent **, const struct dirent **);
           int            closedir(DIR *);
           int            dirfd(DIR *);
           DIR           *fdopendir(int);
           DIR           *opendir(const char *);
           struct dirent *readdir(DIR *);
           int            readdir_r(DIR *restrict, struct dirent *restrict,
                              struct dirent **restrict);
           void           rewinddir(DIR *);
           int            scandir(const char *, struct dirent ***,
                              int (*)(const struct dirent *),
                              int (*)(const struct dirent **,
                              const struct dirent **));
           void           seekdir(DIR *, long);
           long           telldir(DIR *);
