       The iostat command is used for monitoring system input/output device
       loading by observing the time the devices are active in relation to
       their average transfer rates. The iostat command generates reports
       that can be used to change system configuration to better balance the
       input/output load between physical disks.
       The first report generated by the iostat command provides statistics
       concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the -y option
       is used (in this case, this first report is omitted).  Each
       subsequent report covers the time since the previous report. All
       statistics are reported each time the iostat command is run. The
       report consists of a CPU header row followed by a row of CPU
       statistics. On multiprocessor systems, CPU statistics are calculated
       system-wide as averages among all processors. A device header row is
       displayed followed by a line of statistics for each device that is
       configured.
       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report. The count parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the interval parameter. If the count parameter is
       specified, the value of count determines the number of reports
       generated at interval seconds apart. If the interval parameter is
       specified without the count parameter, the iostat command generates
       reports continuously.
