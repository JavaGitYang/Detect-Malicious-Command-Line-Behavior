       The touch utility shall change the last data modification timestamps,
       the last data access timestamps, or both.
       The time used can be specified by the −t time option-argument, the
       corresponding time fields of the file referenced by the −r ref_file
       option-argument, or the −d date_time option-argument, as specified in
       the following sections. If none of these are specified, touch shall
       use the current time.
       For each file operand, touch shall perform actions equivalent to the
       following functions defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008:
        1. If file does not exist:
            a. The creat() function is called with the following arguments:
               --  The file operand is used as the path argument.
               --  The value of the bitwise-inclusive OR of S_IRUSR,
                   S_IWUSR, S_IRGRP, S_IWGRP, S_IROTH, and S_IWOTH is used
                   as the mode argument.
            b. The futimens() function is called with the following
               arguments:
               --  The file descriptor opened in step 1a.
               --  The access time and the modification time, set as
                   described in the OPTIONS section, are used as the first
                   and second elements of the times array argument,
                   respectively.
        2. If file exists, the utimensat() function is called with the
           following arguments:
            a. The AT_FDCWD special value is used as the fd argument.
            b. The file operand is used as the path argument.
            c. The access time and the modification time, set as described
               in the OPTIONS section, are used as the first and second
               elements of the times array argument, respectively.
            d. The flag argument is set to zero.
