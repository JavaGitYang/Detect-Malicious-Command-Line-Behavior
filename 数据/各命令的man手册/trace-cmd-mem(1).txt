       The trace-cmd(1) mem requires a trace-cmd record that enabled the
       following events:
           kmalloc
           kmalloc_node
           kfree
           kmem_cache_alloc
           kmem_cache_alloc_node
           kmem_cache_alloc_free
       It then reads the amount requested and the ammount freed as well as
       the functions that called the allocation. It then reports the final
       amount of bytes requested and allocated, along with the total amount
       allocated and requested, as well as the max allocation and requested
       during the run. It reports the amount of wasted bytes (allocated -
       requested) that was not freed, as well as the max wasted amount
       during the run. The list is sorted by descending order of wasted
       bytes after the run.
