       The MQPRIO qdisc is a simple queuing discipline that allows mapping
       traffic flows to hardware queue ranges using priorities and a
       configurable priority to traffic class mapping. A traffic class in
       this context is a set of contiguous qdisc classes which map 1:1 to a
       set of hardware exposed queues.
       By default the qdisc allocates a pfifo qdisc (packet limited first
       in, first out queue) per TX queue exposed by the lower layer device.
       Other queuing disciplines may be added subsequently. Packets are
       enqueued using the map parameter and hashed across the indicated
       queues in the offset and count.  By default these parameters are
       configured by the hardware driver to match the hardware QOS
       structures.
       Channel mode supports full offload of the mqprio options, the traffic
       classes, the queue configurations and QOS attributes to the hardware.
       Enabled hardware can provide hardware QOS with the ability to steer
       traffic flows to designated traffic classes provided by this qdisc.
       Hardware based QOS is configured using the shaper parameter.
       bw_rlimit with minimum and maximum bandwidth rates can be used for
       setting transmission rates on each traffic class. Also further qdiscs
       may be added to the classes of MQPRIO to create more complex
       configurations.
