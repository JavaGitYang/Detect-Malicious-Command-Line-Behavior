       The pam_get_user function returns the name of the user specified by
       pam_start(3). If no user was specified it what pam_get_item (pamh,
       PAM_USER, ... ); would have returned. If this is NULL it obtains the
       username via the pam_conv(3) mechanism, it prompts the user with the
       first non-NULL string in the following list:
       ·   The prompt argument passed to the function.
       ·   What is returned by pam_get_item (pamh, PAM_USER_PROMPT, ... );
       ·   The default prompt: "login: "
       By whatever means the username is obtained, a pointer to it is
       returned as the contents of *user. Note, this memory should not be
       free()'d or modified by the module.
       This function sets the PAM_USER item associated with the
       pam_set_item(3) and pam_get_item(3) functions.
