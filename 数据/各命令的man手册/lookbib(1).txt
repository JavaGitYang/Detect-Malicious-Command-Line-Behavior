       lookbib prints a prompt on the standard error (unless the standard
       input is not a terminal), reads from the standard input a line
       containing a set of keywords, searches the bibliographic databases
       filename... for references containing those keywords, prints any
       references found on the standard output, and repeats this process
       until the end of input.  For each database filename to be searched,
       if an index filename.i created by indxbib(1) exists, then it will be
       searched instead; each index can cover multiple databases.
