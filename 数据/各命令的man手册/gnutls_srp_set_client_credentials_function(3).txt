       This function can be used to set a callback to retrieve the username
       and password for client SRP authentication.  The callback's function
       form is:
       int (*callback)(gnutls_session_t, char** username, char**password);
       The  username and  password must be allocated using gnutls_malloc().
       username and  password should be ASCII strings or UTF-8 strings
       prepared using the "SASLprep" profile of "stringprep".
       The callback function will be called once per handshake before the
       initial hello message is sent.
       The callback should not return a negative error code the second time
       called, since the handshake procedure will be aborted.
       The callback function should return 0 on success.  -1 indicates an
       error.
