       bootctl checks, updates, installs or removes the boot loader from the
       current system.
       bootctl status checks and prints the currently installed versions of
       the boot loader binaries and all current EFI boot variables.
       bootctl update updates all installed versions of systemd-boot, if the
       current version is newer than the version installed in the EFI system
       partition. This also includes the EFI default/fallback loader at
       /EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. A systemd-boot entry in the EFI boot variables
       is created if there is no current entry. The created entry will be
       added to the end of the boot order list.
       bootctl install installs systemd-boot into the EFI system partition.
       A copy of systemd-boot will be stored as the EFI default/fallback
       loader at /EFI/BOOT/BOOT*.EFI. A systemd-boot entry in the EFI boot
       variables is created and added to the top of the boot order list.
       bootctl remove removes all installed versions of systemd-boot from
       the EFI system partition, and removes systemd-boot from the EFI boot
       variables.
       If no command is passed, status is implied.
