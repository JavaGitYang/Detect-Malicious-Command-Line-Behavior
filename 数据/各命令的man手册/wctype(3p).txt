       For wctype(): The functionality described on this reference page is
       aligned with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the
       requirements described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional.
       This volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions are defined for valid character
       class names as defined in the current locale or in the locale
       represented by locale, respectively.
       The property argument is a string identifying a generic character
       class for which codeset-specific type information is required. The
       following character class names shall be defined in all locales:
              alnum   digit   punct
              alpha   graph   space
              blank   lower   upper
              cntrl   print   xdigit
       Additional character class names defined in the locale definition
       file (category LC_CTYPE) can also be specified.
       These functions shall return a value of type wctype_t, which can be
       used as the second argument to subsequent calls of iswctype() and
       iswctype_l().
       The wctype() and wctype_l() functions shall determine values of
       wctype_t according to the rules of the coded character set defined by
       character type information in the current locale or in the locale
       represented by locale, respectively (category LC_CTYPE).
       The values returned by wctype() shall be valid until a call to
       setlocale() that modifies the category LC_CTYPE.
       The values returned by wctype_l() shall be valid only in calls to
       iswctype_l() with a locale represented by locale with the same
       LC_CTYPE category value.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to wctype_l() is the
       special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not a valid locale
       object handle.
