       Apply the TLS Pseudo-Random-Function (PRF) on the master secret and
       the provided data.
       The  label variable usually contains a string denoting the purpose
       for the generated data.  The  seed usually contains data such as the
       client and server random, perhaps together with some additional data
       that is added to guarantee uniqueness of the output for a particular
       purpose.
       Because the output is not guaranteed to be unique for a particular
       session unless  seed includes the client random and server random
       fields (the PRF would output the same data on another connection
       resumed from the first one), it is not recommended to use this
       function directly.  The gnutls_prf() function seeds the PRF with the
       client and server random fields directly, and is recommended if you
       want to generate pseudo random data unique for each session.
