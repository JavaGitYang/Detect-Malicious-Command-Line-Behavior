       This function should never be used.  Use free(3) instead.  Starting
       with version 2.26, it has been removed from glibc.
   1-arg cfree
       In glibc, the function cfree() is a synonym for free(3), "added for
       compatibility with SunOS".
       Other systems have other functions with this name.  The declaration
       is sometimes in <stdlib.h> and sometimes in <malloc.h>.
   3-arg cfree
       Some SCO and Solaris versions have malloc libraries with a 3-argument
       cfree(), apparently as an analog to calloc(3).
       If you need it while porting something, add
           #define cfree(p, n, s) free((p))
       to your file.
       A frequently asked question is "Can I use free(3) to free memory
       allocated with calloc(3), or do I need cfree()?"  Answer: use
       free(3).
       An SCO manual writes: "The cfree routine is provided for compliance
       to the iBCSe2 standard and simply calls free.  The num and size argu‚Äê
       ments to cfree are not used."
