       This function can be called at any time to get the revision level of
       the library. It is not necessary to have invoked pfm_initialize()
       prior to calling this function.
       The revision number is composed of two fields: a major number and a
       minor number. Both can be extracted using macros provided in the
       header file:
       PFMLIB_MAJ_VERSION(v)
              returns the major number encoded in v.
       PFMLIB_MIN_VERSION(v)
              returns the minor number encoded in v.
