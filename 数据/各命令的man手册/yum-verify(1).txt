       This plugin extends yum with some commands that give verification
       information on the installed system, much like rpm -V. You can change
       how the verification is done and which files it applies to. In case
       any mismatches are found, the exit status is set to 1.
       added yum commands are:
        * verify
        * verify-rpm
        * verify-all
       all of which take the same arguments as the list yum command. You can
       only verify packages that are installed on the system.
       verify Is the generic verification command, and is intended to give
              the most useful output. It removes all false matches due to
              multilib and ignores changes to configuration files by
              default.
       verify-rpm
              Does the same checks as rpm -V.
       verify-all
              Is used to list all the differences, including some that rpm
              itself will ignore.
