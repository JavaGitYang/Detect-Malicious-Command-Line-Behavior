       sctp_sendmsg is a wrapper library function that can be used to send a
       message from a socket while using the advanced features of SCTP.  sd
       is the socket descriptor from which the message pointed to by msg of
       length len is sent.  to is the destination address of the message and
       tolen is the length of the destination address.  stream_no identifies
       the stream number that the application wishes to send this message
       to.  flags parameter is composed of a bitwise OR of the following
       values.
       SCTP_UNORDERED
              This flags requests the un-ordered delivery of the message.
       SCTP_ADDR_OVER
              This flag, in the one-to-many style, requests the SCTP stack
              to override the primary destination address with address
              specified in to.
       SCTP_ABORT
              Setting this flag causes the specified association to abort by
              sending an ABORT message to the peer(one-to-many style only).
              The ABORT chunk will contain an error cause 'User Initiated
              Abort' with cause code 12. The cause specific information of
              this error cause is provided in msg.
       SCTP_EOF
              Setting this flag invokes the SCTP graceful shutdown procedure
              on the specific association(one-to-many style only).
       timetolive specifies the time duration in milliseconds. The sending
       side will expire the message if the message has not been sent to the
       peer within this time period.  A value of 0 indicates that no timeout
       should occur on this message.  ppid is an opaque unsigned value that
       is passed to the remote end along with the message.  context is a 32
       bit opaque value that is passed back to the upper layer along with
       the undelivered message if an error occurs on the send of the
       message.
