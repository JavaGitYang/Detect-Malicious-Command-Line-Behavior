       This function will try to verify the given crl and return its
       verification status.  See gnutls_x509_crt_list_verify() for a
       detailed description of return values. Note that since GnuTLS 3.1.4
       this function includes the time checks.
       Note that value in  verify is set only when the return value of this
       function is success (i.e, failure to trust a CRL a certificate does
       not imply a negative return value).
       Before GnuTLS 3.5.7 this function would return zero or a positive
       number on success.
