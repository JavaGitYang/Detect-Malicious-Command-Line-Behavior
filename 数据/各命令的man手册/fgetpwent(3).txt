       The fgetpwent() function returns a pointer to a structure containing
       the broken out fields of a line in the file stream.  The first time
       it is called it returns the first entry; thereafter, it returns
       successive entries.  The file referred to by stream must have the
       same format as /etc/passwd (see passwd(5)).
       The passwd structure is defined in <pwd.h> as follows:
           struct passwd {
               char   *pw_name;       /* username */
               char   *pw_passwd;     /* user password */
               uid_t   pw_uid;        /* user ID */
               gid_t   pw_gid;        /* group ID */
               char   *pw_gecos;      /* real name */
               char   *pw_dir;        /* home directory */
               char   *pw_shell;      /* shell program */
           };
