       usb-devices is a (bash) shell script that can be used to display
       details of USB buses in the system and the devices connected to them.
       The output of the script is similar to the usb/devices file available
       either under /proc/bus (if usbfs is mounted), or under
       /sys/kernel/debug (if debugfs is mounted there). The script is
       primarily intended to be used if the file is not available.
       In contrast to the usb/devices file, this script only lists active
       interfaces (those marked with a "*" in the usb/devices file) and
       their endpoints.
       Be advised that there can be differences in the way information is
       sorted, as well as in the format of the output.
