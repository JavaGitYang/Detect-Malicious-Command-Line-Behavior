       The stapvirt program can be used to add ports to domains managed by
       libvirt (see <http://libvirt.org/>).  These ports can then be used by
       stap to run scripts inside the domains (see the '--remote' option in
       stap(1) for more information).
       Ports are added to the definition of the domain using the port-add
       command.  These ports can later be removed using the port-remove com‚Äê
       mand.  Note that there can only be as many simultaneous stap sessions
       as there are ports.
       Starting from libvirt v1.1.1 and QEMU v0.10.0, SystemTap ports can be
       hotplugged and thus do not need to be added first using the port-add
       command.  However, you need to ensure that there is a virtio-serial
       controller in place so that hotplugged ports can be connected. If
       creating a domain using virt-install, you can do this by adding this
       option:
              $ virt-install [...] --controller=virtio-serial
       If the domain has already been created, you can simply do port-add
       followed immediately by port-remove, and then power off and restart
       the domain. The port will be removed, but the controller will remain.
