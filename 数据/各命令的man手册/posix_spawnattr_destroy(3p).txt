       The posix_spawnattr_destroy() function shall destroy a spawn
       attributes object. A destroyed attr attributes object can be
       reinitialized using posix_spawnattr_init(); the results of otherwise
       referencing the object after it has been destroyed are undefined. An
       implementation may cause posix_spawnattr_destroy() to set the object
       referenced by attr to an invalid value.
       The posix_spawnattr_init() function shall initialize a spawn
       attributes object attr with the default value for all of the
       individual attributes used by the implementation. Results are
       undefined if posix_spawnattr_init() is called specifying an already
       initialized attr attributes object.
       A spawn attributes object is of type posix_spawnattr_t (defined in
       <spawn.h>) and is used to specify the inheritance of process
       attributes across a spawn operation. POSIX.1‐2008 does not define
       comparison or assignment operators for the type posix_spawnattr_t.
       Each implementation shall document the individual attributes it uses
       and their default values unless these values are defined by
       POSIX.1‐2008.  Attributes not defined by POSIX.1‐2008, their default
       values, and the names of the associated functions to get and set
       those attribute values are implementation-defined.
       The resulting spawn attributes object (possibly modified by setting
       individual attribute values), is used to modify the behavior of
       posix_spawn() or posix_spawnp().  After a spawn attributes object has
       been used to spawn a process by a call to a posix_spawn() or
       posix_spawnp(), any function affecting the attributes object
       (including destruction) shall not affect any process that has been
       spawned in this way.
