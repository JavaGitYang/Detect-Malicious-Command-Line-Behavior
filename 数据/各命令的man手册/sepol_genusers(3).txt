       sepol_genusers generates a new binary policy image from an existing
       binary policy image stored in the memory region described by the
       starting address data and the length len and a pair of user
       configuration files named system.users and local.users from the
       directory specified by usersdir.  The resulting binary policy is
       placed into dynamically allocated memory and the variables newdata
       and newlen are set to refer to the new binary image's starting
       address and length.  The original binary policy image is not
       modified.
       By default, sepol_genusers will preserve user entries that are
       defined in the original binary policy image but not defined in the
       user configuration files.  If such user entries should instead by
       omitted entirely from the new binary policy image, then the
       sepol_set_delusers function may be called with on set to 1 prior to
       calling sepol_genusers in order to enable deletion of such users.
