       In a nutshell, pam_timestamp caches successful authentication
       attempts, and allows you to use a recent successful attempt as the
       basis for authentication. This is similar mechanism which is used in
       sudo.
       When an application opens a session using pam_timestamp, a timestamp
       file is created in the timestampdir directory for the user. When an
       application attempts to authenticate the user, a pam_timestamp will
       treat a sufficiently recent timestamp file as grounds for succeeding.
