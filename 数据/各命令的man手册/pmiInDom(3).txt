       As part of the Performance Co-Pilot Log Import API (see
       LOGIMPORT(3)), these routines provide convenience methods (especially
       for script use) for constructing pmID, pmInDom and pmUnits structures
       respectively, to be used in subsequent calls to pmiAddMetric(3) and
       pmiAddInstance(3).
       Refer to pmLookupDesc(3) for a complete description of the values and
       semantics of the components of a pmUnits structure, and hence the
       valid argument values for pmiUnits.
