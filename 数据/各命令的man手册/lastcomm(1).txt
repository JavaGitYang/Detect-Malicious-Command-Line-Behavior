       lastcomm prints out information about previously executed commands.
       If no arguments are specified, lastcomm will print info about all of
       the commands in acct (the record file).  If called with one or more
       of command-name, user-name, or terminal-name, only records containing
       those items will be displayed.  For example, to find out which users
       used command `a.out' and which users were logged into `tty0', type:
                                lastcomm a.out tty0
       This will print any entry for which `a.out' or `tty0' matches in any
       of the record's fields (command, name, or terminal).  If you want to
       find only items that match *all* of the arguments on the command
       line, you must use the '-strict-match' option.  For example, to list
       all of the executions of command a.out by user root on terminal tty0,
       type:
          lastcomm --strict-match --command a.out --user root --tty tty0
       The order of the arguments is not important.
       For each entry the following information is printed:
          + command name of the process
          + flags, as recorded by the system accounting routines:
               S -- command executed by super-user
               F -- command executed after a fork but without a following
       exec
               C -- command run in PDP-11 compatibility mode (VAX only)
               D -- command terminated with the generation of a core file
               X -- command was terminated with the signal SIGTERM
          + the name of the user who ran the process
          + time the process started
