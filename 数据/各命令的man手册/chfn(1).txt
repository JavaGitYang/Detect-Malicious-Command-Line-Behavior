       chfn is used to change your finger information.  This information is
       stored in the /etc/passwd file, and is displayed by the finger
       program.  The Linux finger command will display four pieces of
       information that can be changed by chfn: your real name, your work
       room and phone, and your home phone.
       Any of the four pieces of information can be specified on the command
       line.  If no information is given on the command line, chfn enters
       interactive mode.
       In interactive mode, chfn will prompt for each field.  At a prompt,
       you can enter the new information, or just press return to leave the
       field unchanged.  Enter the keyword "none" to make the field blank.
       chfn supports non-local entries (kerberos, LDAP, etc.) if linked with
       libuser, otherwise use ypchfn, lchfn or any other implementation for
       non-local entries.
