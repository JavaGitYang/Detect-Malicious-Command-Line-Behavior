       Sets the priorities to use on the ciphers, key exchange methods, and
       macs.  This function avoids keeping a priority cache and is used to
       directly set string priorities to a TLS session.  For documentation
       check the gnutls_priority_init().
       To use a reasonable default, consider using
       gnutls_set_default_priority(), instead of this function.
