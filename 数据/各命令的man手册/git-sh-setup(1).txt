       This is not a command the end user would want to run. Ever. This
       documentation is meant for people who are studying the Porcelain-ish
       scripts and/or are writing new ones.
       The git sh-setup scriptlet is designed to be sourced (using .) by
       other shell scripts to set up some variables pointing at the normal
       Git directories and a few helper shell functions.
       Before sourcing it, your script should set up a few variables; USAGE
       (and LONG_USAGE, if any) is used to define message given by usage()
       shell function. SUBDIRECTORY_OK can be set if the script can run from
       a subdirectory of the working tree (some commands do not).
       The scriptlet sets GIT_DIR and GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY shell variables,
       but does not export them to the environment.
