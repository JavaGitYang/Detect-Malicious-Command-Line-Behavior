       The ttyname() function shall return a pointer to a string containing
       a null-terminated pathname of the terminal associated with file
       descriptor fildes.  The application shall not modify the string
       returned. The returned pointer might be invalidated or the string
       content might be overwritten by a subsequent call to ttyname().
       The ttyname() function need not be thread-safe.
       The ttyname_r() function shall store the null-terminated pathname of
       the terminal associated with the file descriptor fildes in the
       character array referenced by name.  The array is namesize characters
       long and should have space for the name and the terminating null
       character. The maximum length of the terminal name shall be
       {TTY_NAME_MAX}.
