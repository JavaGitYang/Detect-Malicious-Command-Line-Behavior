       The mkdtemp() function generates a uniquely named temporary directory
       from template.  The last six characters of template must be XXXXXX
       and these are replaced with a string that makes the directory name
       unique.  The directory is then created with permissions 0700.  Since
       it will be modified, template must not be a string constant, but
       should be declared as a character array.
