       sd_bus_message_get_cookie() returns the transaction cookie of a
       message. The cookie uniquely identifies a message within each bus
       peer, but is not globally unique. It is assigned when a message is
       sent.
       sd_bus_message_get_reply_cookie() returns the transaction cookie of
       the message the specified message is a response to. When a reply
       message is generated for a method call message, its cookie is copied
       over into this field. Note that while every message that is
       transferred is identified by a cookie, only response messages carry a
       reply cookie field.
       Both functions take a message object as first parameter and a place
       to store the 64-bit cookie in.
