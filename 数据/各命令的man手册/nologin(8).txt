       nologin displays a message that an account is not available and exits
       non-zero.  It is intended as a replacement shell field to deny login
       access to an account.
       If the file /etc/nologin.txt exists, nologin displays its contents to
       the user instead of the default message.
       The exit code returned by nologin is always 1.
