       badblocks is used to search for bad blocks on a device (usually a
       disk partition).  device is the special file corresponding to the
       device (e.g /dev/hdc1).  last_block is the last block to be checked;
       if it is not specified, the last block on the device is used as a
       default.  first_block is an optional parameter specifying the
       starting block number for the test, which allows the testing to start
       in the middle of the disk.  If it is not specified the first block on
       the disk is used as a default.
       Important note: If the output of badblocks is going to be fed to the
       e2fsck or mke2fs programs, it is important that the block size is
       properly specified, since the block numbers which are generated are
       very dependent on the block size in use by the filesystem.  For this
       reason, it is strongly recommended that users not run badblocks
       directly, but rather use the -c option of the e2fsck and mke2fs
       programs.
