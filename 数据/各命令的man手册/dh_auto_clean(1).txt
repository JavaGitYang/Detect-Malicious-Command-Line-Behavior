       dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       clean up after a package build. It does so by running the appropriate
       command for the build system it detects the package uses. For
       example, if there's a Makefile and it contains a distclean,
       realclean, or clean target, then this is done by running make (or
       MAKE, if the environment variable is set). If there is a setup.py or
       Build.PL, it is run to clean the package.
       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, or tries to use the wrong clean target, you're encouraged to
       skip using dh_auto_clean at all, and just run make clean manually.
