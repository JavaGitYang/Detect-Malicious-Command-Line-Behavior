       The pthread_cond_destroy() function shall destroy the given condition
       variable specified by cond; the object becomes, in effect,
       uninitialized. An implementation may cause pthread_cond_destroy() to
       set the object referenced by cond to an invalid value. A destroyed
       condition variable object can be reinitialized using
       pthread_cond_init(); the results of otherwise referencing the object
       after it has been destroyed are undefined.
       It shall be safe to destroy an initialized condition variable upon
       which no threads are currently blocked. Attempting to destroy a
       condition variable upon which other threads are currently blocked
       results in undefined behavior.
       The pthread_cond_init() function shall initialize the condition
       variable referenced by cond with attributes referenced by attr.  If
       attr is NULL, the default condition variable attributes shall be
       used; the effect is the same as passing the address of a default
       condition variable attributes object. Upon successful initialization,
       the state of the condition variable shall become initialized.
       Only cond itself may be used for performing synchronization. The
       result of referring to copies of cond in calls to
       pthread_cond_wait(), pthread_cond_timedwait(), pthread_cond_signal(),
       pthread_cond_broadcast(), and pthread_cond_destroy() is undefined.
       Attempting to initialize an already initialized condition variable
       results in undefined behavior.
       In cases where default condition variable attributes are appropriate,
       the macro PTHREAD_COND_INITIALIZER can be used to initialize
       condition variables. The effect shall be equivalent to dynamic
       initialization by a call to pthread_cond_init() with parameter attr
       specified as NULL, except that no error checks are performed.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the cond argument
       to pthread_cond_destroy() does not refer to an initialized condition
       variable.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_cond_init() does not refer to an initialized condition
       variable attributes object.
