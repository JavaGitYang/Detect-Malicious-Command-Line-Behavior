       The grohtml front end (which consists of a preprocessor, pre-grohtml,
       and a device driver, post-grohtml) translates the output of GNU troff
       to HTML.  Users should always invoke grohtml via the groff command
       with a -Thtml option.  If no files are given, grohtml will read the
       standard input.  A filename of - will also cause grohtml to read the
       standard input.  Html output is written to the standard output.  When
       grohtml is run by groff options can be passed to grohtml using
       groff's -P option.
       grohtml invokes groff twice.  In the first pass, pictures, equations,
       and tables are rendered using the ps device, and in the second pass
       HTML output is generated by the html device.
       grohtml always writes output in UTF-8 encoding and has built-in
       entities for all non-composite unicode characters.  In spite of this,
       groff may issue warnings about unknown special characters if they
       can't be found during the first pass.  Such warnings can be safely
       ignored unless the special characters appear inside a table or
       equation.
