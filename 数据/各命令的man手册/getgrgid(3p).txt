       The getgrgid() function shall search the group database for an entry
       with a matching gid.
       The getgrgid() function need not be thread-safe.
       The getgrgid_r() function shall update the group structure pointed to
       by grp and store a pointer to that structure at the location pointed
       to by result.  The structure shall contain an entry from the group
       database with a matching gid.  Storage referenced by the group
       structure is allocated from the memory provided with the buffer
       parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. A call to
       sysconf(_SC_GETGR_R_SIZE_MAX) returns either âˆ’1 without changing
       errno or an initial value suggested for the size of this buffer.  A
       null pointer shall be returned at the location pointed to by result
       on error or if the requested entry is not found.
