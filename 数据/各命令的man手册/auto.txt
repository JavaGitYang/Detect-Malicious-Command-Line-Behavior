       The auto.master map is consulted to set up automount managed mount
       points when the autofs(8) script is invoked or the automount(8) pro‐
       gram is run. Each line describes a mount point and refers to an aut‐
       ofs map describing file systems to be mounted under the mount point.
       The default location of the master map is @mapdir@/auto.master but an
       alternate name may be given on the command line when running the au‐
       tomounter and the default master map may changed by setting the
       MASTER_MAP_NAME configuration variable in @confdir@/autofs.  If the
       master map name has no path then the system Name Service Switch con‐
       figuration will be consulted and each of the sources searched in line
       with the rules given in the Name Service Switch configuration.
       Access to mounts in maps is governed by a key.
       For direct maps the mount point is always specified as:
       /-
       and the key used within the direct map is the full path to the mount
       point. The direct map may have multiple entries in the master map.
       For indirect maps access is by using the path scheme:
       /mount-point/key
       where mount-point is one of the entries listed in the master map. The
       key is a single directory component and is matched against entries in
       the map given in the entry (See autofs(5)).
       Additionally, a map may be included from its source as if it were it‐
       self present in the master map by including a line of the form:
       +[maptype[,format]:]map [options]
       and automount(8) will process the map according to the specification
       described below for map entries. Indirect map entries must be unique
       in the master map so second and subsequent entries for an indirect
       mount point are ignored by automount(8).
