       The lp utility shall copy the input files to an output destination in
       an unspecified manner. The default output destination should be to a
       hardcopy device, such as a printer or microfilm recorder, that
       produces non-volatile, human-readable documents. If such a device is
       not available to the application, or if the system provides no such
       device, the lp utility shall exit with a non-zero exit status.
       The actual writing to the output device may occur some time after the
       lp utility successfully exits. During the portion of the writing that
       corresponds to each input file, the implementation shall guarantee
       exclusive access to the device.
       The lp utility shall associate a unique request ID with each request.
       Normally, a banner page is produced to separate and identify each
       print job. This page may be suppressed by implementation-defined
       conditions, such as an operator command or one of the âˆ’o option
       values.
