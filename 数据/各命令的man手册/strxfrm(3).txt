       The strxfrm() function transforms the src string into a form such
       that the result of strcmp(3) on two strings that have been
       transformed with strxfrm() is the same as the result of strcoll(3) on
       the two strings before their transformation.  The first n bytes of
       the transformed string are placed in dest.  The transformation is
       based on the program's current locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See
       setlocale(3)).
