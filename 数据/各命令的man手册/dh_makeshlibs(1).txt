       dh_makeshlibs is a debhelper program that automatically scans for
       shared libraries, and generates a shlibs file for the libraries it
       finds.
       It will also ensure that ldconfig is invoked during install and
       removal when it finds shared libraries.  Since debhelper 9.20151004,
       this is done via a dpkg trigger.  In older versions of debhelper,
       dh_makeshlibs would generate a maintainer script for this purpose.
