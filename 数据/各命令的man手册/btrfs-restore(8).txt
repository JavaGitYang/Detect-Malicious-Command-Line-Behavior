       btrfs restore is used to try to salvage files from a damaged
       filesystem and restore them into <path> or just list the subvolume
       tree roots. The filesystem image is not modified.
       If the filesystem is damaged and cannot be repaired by the other
       tools (btrfs-check(8) or btrfs-rescue(8)), btrfs restore could be
       used to retrieve file data, as far as the metadata are readable. The
       checks done by restore are less strict and the process is usually
       able to get far enough to retrieve data from the whole filesystem.
       This comes at a cost that some data might be incomplete or from older
       versions if theyâ€™re available.
       There are several options to attempt restoration of various file
       metadata type. You can try a dry run first to see how well the
       process goes and use further options to extend the set of restored
       metadata.
       For images with damaged tree structures, there are several options to
       point the process to some spare copy.
           Note
           It is recommended to read the following btrfs wiki page if your
           data is not salvaged with default option:
