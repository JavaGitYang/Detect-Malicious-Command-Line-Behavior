       The shell shall execute commands from the file in the current
       environment.
       If file does not contain a <slash>, the shell shall use the search
       path specified by PATH to find the directory containing file.  Unlike
       normal command search, however, the file searched for by the dot
       utility need not be executable. If no readable file is found, a non-
       interactive shell shall abort; an interactive shell shall write a
       diagnostic message to standard error, but this condition shall not be
       considered a syntax error.
