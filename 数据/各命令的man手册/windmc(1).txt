       windmc reads message definitions from an input file (.mc) and
       translate them into a set of output files.  The output files may be
       of four kinds:
       "h" A C header file containing the message definitions.
       "rc"
           A resource file compilable by the windres tool.
       "bin"
           One or more binary files containing the resource data for a
           specific message language.
       "dbg"
           A C include file that maps message id's to their symbolic name.
       The exact description of these different formats is available in
       documentation from Microsoft.
       When windmc converts from the "mc" format to the "bin" format, "rc",
       "h", and optional "dbg" it is acting like the Windows Message
       Compiler.
