       Behavior:
              The delete function will remove the object corresponding to
              the provided key from the local store. If no match is found,
              no action is taken. Changes will become permanent when
              semanage_commit(3) is invoked. Additional checks may be
              performed at that time to ensure the system is left in a valid
              state.
       Parameters:
              The handle is used to track persistent state across semanage
              calls, and for error reporting. The key identifies the data
              object, which will be deleted from the local store. The key is
              a property of the caller, and will not be stored or modified
              internally.
       Requirements:
              This function requires an semanage connection to be
              established (see semanage_connect(3) ), and must be executed
              in a transaction (see semanage_begin_transaction(3) ).
