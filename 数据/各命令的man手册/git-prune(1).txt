           Note
           In most cases, users should run git gc, which calls git prune.
           See the section "NOTES", below.
       This runs git fsck --unreachable using all the refs available in
       refs/, optionally with additional set of objects specified on the
       command line, and prunes all unpacked objects unreachable from any of
       these head objects from the object database. In addition, it prunes
       the unpacked objects that are also found in packs by running git
       prune-packed. It also removes entries from .git/shallow that are not
       reachable by any ref.
       Note that unreachable, packed objects will remain. If this is not
       desired, see git-repack(1).
