       The uuid_time function extracts the time at which the supplied time-
       based UUID uu was created.  Note that the UUID creation time is only
       encoded within certain types of UUIDs.  This function can only
       reasonably expect to extract the creation time for UUIDs created with
       the uuid_generate_time(3) and uuid_generate_time_safe(3) functions.
       It may or may not work with UUIDs created by other mechanisms.
