       These functions are extensions to the curses library which do not fit
       easily into other categories.
   curses_version
       Use curses_version to get the version number, including patch level
       of the library, e.g., 5.0.19991023
   use_extended_names
       The use_extended_names function controls whether the calling
       application is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names which
       may be compiled into the terminfo description, i.e., via the terminfo
       or termcap interfaces.  Normally these names are available for use,
       since the essential decision is made by using the -x option of @TIC@
       to compile extended terminal definitions.  However you can disable
       this feature to ensure compatibility with other implementations of
       curses.
