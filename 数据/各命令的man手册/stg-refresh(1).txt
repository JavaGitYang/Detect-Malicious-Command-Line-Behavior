       Include the latest work tree and index changes in the current patch.
       This command generates a new git commit object for the patch; the old
       commit is no longer visible.
       Refresh will warn if the index is dirty, and require use of either
       the --index or --force options to override this check. This is to
       prevent accidental full refresh when only some changes were staged
       using git add interative mode.
       You may optionally list one or more files or directories relative to
       the current working directory; if you do, only matching files will be
       updated.
       Behind the scenes, stg refresh first creates a new temporary patch
       with your updates, and then merges that patch into the patch you
       asked to have refreshed. If you asked to refresh a patch other than
       the topmost patch, there can be conflicts; in that case, the
       temporary patch will be left for you to take care of, for example
       with stg squash.
       The creation of the temporary patch is recorded in a separate entry
       in the patch stack log; this means that one undo step will undo the
       merge between the other patch and the temp patch, and two undo steps
       will additionally get rid of the temp patch.
