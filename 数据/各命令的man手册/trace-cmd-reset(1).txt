       The trace-cmd(1) reset command turns off all tracing of Ftrace. This
       will bring back the performance of the system before tracing was
       enabled. This is necessary since trace-cmd-record(1),
       trace-cmd-stop(1) and trace-cmd-extract(1) do not disable the tracer,
       event after the data has been pulled from the buffers. The rational
       is that the user may want to manually enable the tracer with the
       Ftrace pseudo file system, or examine other parts of Ftrace to see
       what trace-cmd did. After the reset command happens, the data in the
       ring buffer, and the options that were used are all lost.
