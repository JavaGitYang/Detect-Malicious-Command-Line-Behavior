       Every menu has an associated pair of curses windows.  The menu window
       displays any title and border associated with the window; the menu
       subwindow displays the items of the menu that are currently available
       for selection.
       The first four functions get and set those windows.  It is not
       necessary to set either window; by default, the driver code uses
       stdscr for both.
       In the set_ functions, window argument of NULL is treated as though
       it were stsdcr.  A menu argument of NULL is treated as a request to
       change the system default menu window or subwindow.
       The function scale_menu returns the minimum size required for the
       subwindow of menu.
