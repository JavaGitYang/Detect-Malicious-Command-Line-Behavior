       Based on examination of the linux/kernel/reboot.c code, it is clear
       that there are two supported functions that the Ctrl-Alt-Del sequence
       can perform.
       hard   Immediately reboot the computer without calling sync(2) and
              without any other preparation.  This is the default.
       soft   Make the kernel send the SIGINT (interrupt) signal to the init
              process (this is always the process with PID 1).  If this
              option is used, the init(8) program must support this feature.
              Since there are now several init(8) programs in the Linux
              community, please consult the documentation for the version
              that you are currently using.
       When the command is run without any argument, it will display the
       current setting.
       The function of ctrlaltdel is usually set in the /etc/rc.local file.
