       The tcdrain() function shall block until all output written to the
       object referred to by fildes is transmitted. The fildes argument is
       an open file descriptor associated with a terminal.
       Any attempts to use tcdrain() from a process which is a member of a
       background process group on a fildes associated with its controlling
       terminal, shall cause the process group to be sent a SIGTTOU signal.
       If the calling thread is blocking SIGTTOU signals or the process is
       ignoring SIGTTOU signals, the process shall be allowed to perform the
       operation, and no signal is sent.
