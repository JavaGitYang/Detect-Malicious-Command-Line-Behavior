       The sem_destroy() function shall destroy the unnamed semaphore
       indicated by sem.  Only a semaphore that was created using sem_init()
       may be destroyed using sem_destroy(); the effect of calling
       sem_destroy() with a named semaphore is undefined. The effect of
       subsequent use of the semaphore sem is undefined until sem is
       reinitialized by another call to sem_init().
       It is safe to destroy an initialized semaphore upon which no threads
       are currently blocked. The effect of destroying a semaphore upon
       which other threads are currently blocked is undefined.
