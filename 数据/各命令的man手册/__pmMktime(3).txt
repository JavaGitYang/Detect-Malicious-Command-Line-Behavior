       __pmMktime is very similar to mktime(3), except the timezone used is
       the current ``reporting timezone'' (rather than the default TZ
       environment variable scheme).
       Like mktime(3) the time to be converted is passed via timeptr, and
       the function result contains the calendar time (the number of seconds
       since 00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970).
       The default current reporting timezone is as defined by the TZ
       environment variable, so __pmMktime and mktime(3) will initially
       produce similar conversions.
       Use pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or pmUseZone(3) to establish a
       new current reporting timezone that will effect __pmMktime but not
       mktime(3).
