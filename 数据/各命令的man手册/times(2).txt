       times() stores the current process times in the struct tms that buf
       points to.  The struct tms is as defined in <sys/times.h>:
           struct tms {
               clock_t tms_utime;  /* user time */
               clock_t tms_stime;  /* system time */
               clock_t tms_cutime; /* user time of children */
               clock_t tms_cstime; /* system time of children */
           };
       The tms_utime field contains the CPU time spent executing instruc‐
       tions of the calling process.  The tms_stime field contains the CPU
       time spent executing inside the kernel while performing tasks on
       behalf of the calling process.
       The tms_cutime field contains the sum of the tms_utime and tms_cutime
       values for all waited-for terminated children.  The tms_cstime field
       contains the sum of the tms_stime and tms_cstime values for all
       waited-for terminated children.
       Times for terminated children (and their descendants) are added in at
       the moment wait(2) or waitpid(2) returns their process ID.  In par‐
       ticular, times of grandchildren that the children did not wait for
       are never seen.
       All times reported are in clock ticks.
