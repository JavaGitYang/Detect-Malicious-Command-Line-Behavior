       dh_auto_build is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
       build a package. It does so by running the appropriate command for
       the build system it detects the package uses. For example, if a
       Makefile is found, this is done by running make (or MAKE, if the
       environment variable is set). If there's a setup.py, or Build.PL, it
       is run to build the package.
       This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
       work, you're encouraged to skip using dh_auto_build at all, and just
       run the build process manually.
