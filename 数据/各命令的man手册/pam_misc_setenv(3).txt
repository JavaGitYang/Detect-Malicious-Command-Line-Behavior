       This function performs a task equivalent to pam_putenv(3), its syntax
       is, however, more like the BSD style function; setenv(). The name and
       value are concatenated with an '=' to form a name=value and passed to
       pam_putenv(). If, however, the PAM variable is already set, the
       replacement will only be applied if the last argument, readonly, is
       zero.
