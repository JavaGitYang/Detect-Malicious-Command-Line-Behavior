       Simple program that emulates the programs in the Stanford SRP (Secure
       Remote Password) libraries using GnuTLS.  It is intended for use in
       places where you don't expect SRP authentication to be the used for
       system users.
       In  brief,  to use SRP you need to create two files. These are the
       password file that holds the users and the verifiers associated with
       them  and  the configuration file to hold the group parameters
       (called tpasswd.conf).
