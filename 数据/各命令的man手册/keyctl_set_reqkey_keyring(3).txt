       keyctl_set_reqkey_keyring() sets the default destination for implicit
       key requests for the current thread and returns the old setting.
       After this operation has been issued, keys acquired by implicit key
       requests, such as might be performed by open() on an AFS or NFS
       filesystem, will be linked by default to the specified keyring by
       this function.
       The valid values of reqkey_defl are:
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_NO_CHANGE
              This makes no change to the current setting.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING
              This makes the thread-specific keyring the default
              destination.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_PROCESS_KEYRING
              This makes the process-specific keyring the default
              destination.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING
              This makes the session keyring the default destination.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_KEYRING
              This makes the UID-specific keyring the default destination.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
              This makes the UID-specific session keyring the default
              destination.
       KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT
              This selects the default behaviour which is to use the thread-
              specific keyring if there is one, otherwise the process-
              specific keyring if there is one, otherwise the session
              keyring if there is one, otherwise the UID-specific session
              keyring.
       This setting is inherited across fork() and exec().
