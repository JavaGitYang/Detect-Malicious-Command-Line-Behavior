       The pthread_attr_getscope() and pthread_attr_setscope() functions,
       respectively, shall get and set the contentionscope attribute in the
       attr object.
       The contentionscope attribute may have the values
       PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM, signifying system scheduling contention scope,
       or PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS, signifying process scheduling contention
       scope. The symbols PTHREAD_SCOPE_SYSTEM and PTHREAD_SCOPE_PROCESS are
       defined in the <pthread.h> header.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_attr_getscope() or pthread_attr_setscope() does not refer
       to an initialized thread attributes object.
