       The getrpcent_r(), getrpcbyname_r(), and getrpcbynumber_r() functions
       are the reentrant equivalents of, respectively, getrpcent(3),
       getrpcbyname(3), and getrpcbynumber(3).  They differ in the way that
       the rpcent structure is returned, and in the function calling
       signature and return value.  This manual page describes just the
       differences from the nonreentrant functions.
       Instead of returning a pointer to a statically allocated rpcent
       structure as the function result, these functions copy the structure
       into the location pointed to by result_buf.
       The buf array is used to store the string fields pointed to by the
       returned rpcent structure.  (The nonreentrant functions allocate
       these strings in static storage.)  The size of this array is
       specified in buflen.  If buf is too small, the call fails with the
       error ERANGE, and the caller must try again with a larger buffer.  (A
       buffer of length 1024 bytes should be sufficient for most
       applications.)
       If the function call successfully obtains an RPC record, then *result
       is set pointing to result_buf; otherwise, *result is set to NULL.
