       pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the
       process IDs which match the selection criteria to stdout.  All the
       criteria have to match.  For example,
              $ pgrep -u root sshd
       will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the
       other hand,
              $ pgrep -u root,daemon
       will list the processes owned by root OR daemon.
       pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each
       process instead of listing them on stdout.
