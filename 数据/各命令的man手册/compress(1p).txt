       The compress utility shall attempt to reduce the size of the named
       files by using adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm.
       Note:     Lempel-Ziv is US Patent 4464650, issued to William Eastman,
                 Abraham Lempel, Jacob Ziv, Martin Cohn on August 7th, 1984,
                 and assigned to Sperry Corporation.
                 Lempel-Ziv-Welch compression is covered by US Patent
                 4558302, issued to Terry A. Welch on December 10th, 1985,
                 and assigned to Sperry Corporation.
       On systems not supporting adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding algorithm, the
       input files shall not be changed and an error value greater than two
       shall be returned. Except when the output is to the standard output,
       each file shall be replaced by one with the extension .Z.  If the
       invoking process has appropriate privileges, the ownership, modes,
       access time, and modification time of the original file are
       preserved. If appending the .Z to the filename would make the name
       exceed {NAME_MAX} bytes, the command shall fail. If no files are
       specified, the standard input shall be compressed to the standard
       output.
