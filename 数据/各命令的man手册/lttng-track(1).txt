       The lttng track commands adds one or more entries to a resource
       tracker.
       A resource tracker is a whitelist of resources. Tracked resources are
       allowed to emit events, provided those events are targeted by enabled
       event rules (see lttng-enable-event(1)).
       Tracker entries can be removed from the whitelist with
       lttng-untrack(1).
       As of this version, the only available tracker is the PID tracker.
       The process ID (PID) tracker follows one or more process IDs; only
       the processes with a tracked PID are allowed to emit events. By
       default, all possible PIDs on the system are tracked: any process may
       emit enabled events (equivalent of lttng track --pid --all for all
       domains).
       With the PID tracker, it is possible, for example, to record all
       system calls called by a given process:
           # lttng enable-event --kernel --all --syscall
           # lttng track --kernel --pid=2345
           # lttng start
       If all the PIDs are tracked (i.e. lttng track --pid --all, which is
       the default state of all domains when creating a tracing session),
       then using the track command with one or more specific PIDs has the
       effect of first removing all the PIDs from the whitelist, then adding
       the specified PIDs.
   Example
       Assume the maximum system PID is 7 for this example.
       Initial whitelist:
           [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]
       Command:
           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=3,6,7
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [ ] [6] [7]
       Command:
           $ lttng untrack --userspace --pid=7
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [ ] [ ] [3] [ ] [ ] [6] [ ]
       Command:
           $ lttng track --userspace --pid=1,5
       Whitelist:
           [ ] [1] [ ] [3] [ ] [5] [6] [ ]
       It should be noted that the PID tracker tracks the numeric process
       IDs. Should a process with a given ID exit and another process be
       given this ID, then the latter would also be allowed to emit events.
       See the lttng-untrack(1) for more details about removing entries.
