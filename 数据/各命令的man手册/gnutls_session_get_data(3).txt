       Returns all session parameters needed to be stored to support
       resumption.  The client should call this, and store the returned
       session data. A session may be resumed later by calling
       gnutls_session_set_data().
       This function will fail if called prior to handshake completion. In
       case of false start TLS, the handshake completes only after data have
       been successfully received from the peer.
