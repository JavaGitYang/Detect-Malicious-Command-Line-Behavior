       The setreuid() function shall set the real and effective user IDs of
       the current process to the values specified by the ruid and euid
       arguments. If ruid or euid is −1, the corresponding effective or real
       user ID of the current process shall be left unchanged.
       A process with appropriate privileges can set either ID to any value.
       An unprivileged process can only set the effective user ID if the
       euid argument is equal to either the real, effective, or saved user
       ID of the process.
       If the real user ID is being set (ruid is not −1), or the effective
       user ID is being set to a value not equal to the real user ID, then
       the saved set-user-ID of the current process shall be set equal to
       the new effective user ID.
       It is unspecified whether a process without appropriate privileges is
       permitted to change the real user ID to match the current effective
       user ID or saved set-user-ID of the process.
