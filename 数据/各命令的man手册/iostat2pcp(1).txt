       iostat2pcp reads a text file created with iostat(1) (infile) and
       translates this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the
       basename outfile.  If infile is ``-'' then iostat2pcp reads from
       standard input, allowing easy preprocessing of the iostat(1) output
       with sed(1) or similar.
       The resultant PCP archive may be used with all the PCP client tools
       to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data reduction
       and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine pmie(1), etc.
       A series of physical files will be created with the prefix outfile.
       These are outfile.0 (the performance data), outfile.meta (the
       metadata that describes the performance data) and outfile.index (a
       temporal index to improve efficiency of replay operations for the
       archive).  If any of these files exists already, then iostat2pcp will
       not overwrite them and will exit with an error message.
       The first output sample from iostat(1) contains a statistical summary
       since boot time and is ignored by iostat2pcp, so the first real data
       set is the second one in the iostat(1) output.
       The best results are obtained when iostat(1) was run with its own -t
       flag, so each output sample is prefixed with a timestamp.  Even
       better is -t with $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO set in environment when
       iostat(1) is run, in which case the timestamp includes the timezone.
       Note that if $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO is not used with the -t option then
       iostat(1) may produce a timestamp controlled by LC_TIME from the
       locale that is in a format iostat2pcp cannot parse.  The formats for
       the timestamp that iostat2pcp accepts are illustrated by these
       examples:
       2013-07-06T21:34:39+1000
           (for the $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO).
       2013-07-06 21:34:39
           (for some of the European formats, e.g. de_AT, de_BE, de_LU and
           en_DK.utf8).
       06/07/13 21:34:39
           (for all of the $LC_TIME settings for English locales outside
           North America, e.g. en_AU, en_GB, en_IE, en_NZ, en_SG and en_ZA,
           and all the Spanish locales, e.g.  es_ES, es_MX and es_AR).
       In particular, note that some common North American $LC_TIME settings
       will not work with iostat2pcp (namely, en_US, POSIX and C) because
       they use the MM/DD format which may be incorrectly converted with the
       assumed DD/MM format.  This is another reason to recommend setting
       $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO.
       If there are no timestamps in the input stream, iostat2pcp will try
       and deduce the sample interval if basic Disk data (-d option for
       iostat(1)) is found.  If this fails, then the -t option may be used
       to specify the sample interval in seconds.  This option is ignored if
       timestamps are found in the input stream.
       The -S option may be used to specify as start time for the first real
       sample in infile, where start must have the format HH:MM:SS.  This
       option is ignored if timestamps are found in the input stream.
       The -Z option may be used to specify a timezone.  It must have the
       format +HHMM (for hours and minutes East of UTC) or -HHMM (for hours
       and minutes West of UTC).  Note in particular that neither the
       zoneinfo (aka Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor the Posix TZ
       format, e.g.  EST+5 is allowed for the -Z option.  This option is
       ignored if ISO timestamps are found in the input stream.  If the
       timezone is not specified and cannot be deduced, it defaults to
       ``UTC''.
       Some additional diagnostic output is generated with the -v option.
       iostat2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl wrapper
       around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could be used as an
       example to develop new tools to import other types of performance
       data and create PCP archives.
