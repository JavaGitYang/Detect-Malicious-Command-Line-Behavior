       Note: Since Linux 2.6, this system call is deprecated and does
       nothing.  It is likely to disappear altogether in a future kernel
       release.  Nowadays, the task performed by bdflush() is handled by the
       kernel pdflush thread.
       bdflush() starts, flushes, or tunes the buffer-dirty-flush daemon.
       Only a privileged process (one with the CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) may
       call bdflush().
       If func is negative or 0, and no daemon has been started, then
       bdflush() enters the daemon code and never returns.
       If func is 1, some dirty buffers are written to disk.
       If func is 2 or more and is even (low bit is 0), then address is the
       address of a long word, and the tuning parameter numbered (func-2)/2
       is returned to the caller in that address.
       If func is 3 or more and is odd (low bit is 1), then data is a long
       word, and the kernel sets tuning parameter numbered (func-3)/2 to
       that value.
       The set of parameters, their values, and their valid ranges are
       defined in the Linux kernel source file fs/buffer.c.
