       tunelp sets several parameters for the /dev/lp? devices, for better
       performance (or for any performance at all, if your printer won't
       work without it...) Without parameters, it tells whether the device
       is using interrupts, and if so, which one.  With parameters, it sets
       the device characteristics accordingly.
