       machinectl may be used to introspect and control the state of the
       systemd(1) virtual machine and container registration manager
       systemd-machined.service(8).
       machinectl may be used to execute operations on machines and images.
       Machines in this sense are considered running instances of:
       ·   Virtual Machines (VMs) that virtualize hardware to run full
           operating system (OS) instances (including their kernels) in a
           virtualized environment on top of the host OS.
       ·   Containers that share the hardware and OS kernel with the host
           OS, in order to run OS userspace instances on top the host OS.
       ·   The host system itself
       Machines are identified by names that follow the same rules as UNIX
       and DNS host names, for details, see below. Machines are instantiated
       from disk or file system images that frequently — but not
       necessarily — carry the same name as machines running from them.
       Images in this sense are considered:
       ·   Directory trees containing an OS, including its top-level
           directories /usr, /etc, and so on.
       ·   btrfs subvolumes containing OS trees, similar to normal directory
           trees.
       ·   Binary "raw" disk images containing MBR or GPT partition tables
           and Linux file system partitions.
       ·   The file system tree of the host OS itself.
