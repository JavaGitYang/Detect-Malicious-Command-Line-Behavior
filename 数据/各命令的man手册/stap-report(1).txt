       The stap-report executable collects system information that is useful
       for debugging systemtap bugs. It is a good idea to include such a
       report in bug reports especially if you send them directly to the
       upstream. stap-report can be run either as a normal user or as root.
       The report will be more complete if stap-report is run as root.
