       The strcoll() function compares the two strings s1 and s2.  It
       returns an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if s1 is
       found, respectively, to be less than, to match, or be greater than
       s2.  The comparison is based on strings interpreted as appropriate
       for the program's current locale for category LC_COLLATE.  (See
       setlocale(3).)
