       The file /etc/hosts.equiv allows or denies hosts and users to use the
       r-commands (e.g., rlogin, rsh, or rcp) without supplying a password.
       The file uses the following format:
       +|[-]hostname|+@netgroup|-@netgroup
       [+|[-]username|+@netgroup|-@netgroup]
       The hostname is the name of a host which is logically equivalent to
       the local host.  Users logged into that host are allowed to access
       like-named user accounts on the local host without supplying a
       password.  The hostname may be (optionally) preceded by a plus (+)
       sign.  If the plus sign is used alone, it allows any host to access
       your system.  You can explicitly deny access to a host by preceding
       the hostname by a minus (-) sign.  Users from that host must always
       supply additional credentials, including possibly a password. For
       security reasons you should always use the FQDN of the hostname and
       not the short hostname.
       The username entry grants a specific user access to all user accounts
       (except root) without supplying a password.  That means the user is
       NOT restricted to like-named accounts.  The username may be
       (optionally) preceded by a plus (+) sign.  You can also explicitly
       deny access to a specific user by preceding the username with a minus
       (-) sign.  This says that the user is not trusted no matter what
       other entries for that host exist.
       Netgroups can be specified by preceding the netgroup by an @ sign.
       Be extremely careful when using the plus (+) sign.  A simple
       typographical error could result in a standalone plus sign.  A
       standalone plus sign is a wildcard character that means "any host"!
