       The newlocale() function creates a new locale object, or modifies an
       existing object, returning a reference to the new or modified object
       as the function result.  Whether the call creates a new object or
       modifies an existing object is determined by the value of base:
       *  If base is (locale_t) 0, a new object is created.
       *  If base refers to valid existing locale object (i.e., an object
          returned by a previous call to newlocale() or duplocale(3)), then
          that object is modified by the call.  If the call is successful,
          the contents of base are unspecified (in particular, the object
          referred to by base may be freed, and a new object created).
          Therefore, the caller should ensure that it stops using base
          before the call to newlocale(), and should subsequently refer to
          the modified object via the reference returned as the function
          result.  If the call fails, the contents of base remain valid and
          unchanged.
       If base is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE (see
       duplocale(3)), or is not (locale_t) 0 and is not a valid locale
       object handle, the behavior is undefined.
       The category_mask argument is a bit mask that specifies the locale
       categories that are to be set in a newly created locale object or
       modified in an existing object.  The mask is constructed by a bitwise
       OR of the constants LC_ADDRESS_MASK, LC_CTYPE_MASK, LC_COLLATE_MASK,
       LC_IDENTIFICATION_MASK, LC_MEASUREMENT_MASK, LC_MESSAGES_MASK,
       LC_MONETARY_MASK, LC_NUMERIC_MASK, LC_NAME_MASK, LC_PAPER_MASK,
       LC_TELEPHONE_MASK, and LC_TIME_MASK.  Alternatively, the mask can be
       specified as LC_ALL_MASK, which is equivalent to ORing all of the
       preceding constants.
       For each category specified in category_mask, the locale data from
       locale will be used in the object returned by newlocale().  If a new
       locale object is being created, data for all categories not specified
       in category_mask is taken from the default ("POSIX") locale.
       The following preset values of locale are defined for all categories
       that can be specified in category_mask:
       "POSIX"
              A minimal locale environment for C language programs.
       "C"    Equivalent to "POSIX".
       ""     An implementation-defined native environment corresponding to
              the values of the LC_* and LANG environment variables (see
              locale(7)).
   freelocale()
       The freelocale() function deallocates the resources associated with
       locobj, a locale object previously returned by a call to newlocale()
       or duplocale(3).  If locobj is LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is not valid
       locale object handle, the results are undefined.
       Once a locale object has been freed, the program should make no
       further use of it.
