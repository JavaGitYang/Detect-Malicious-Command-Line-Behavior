       The pfifo and bfifo qdiscs are unadorned First In, First Out queues.
       They are the simplest queues possible and therefore have no overhead.
       pfifo constrains the queue size as measured in packets.  bfifo does
       so as measured in bytes.
       Like all non-default qdiscs, they maintain statistics. This might be
       a reason to prefer pfifo or bfifo over the default.
