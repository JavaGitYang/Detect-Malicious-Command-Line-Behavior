       The functions sd_bus_message_append_string_memfd and
       sd_bus_message_append_string_iovec can be used to append a single
       string (item of type "s") to message m.
       In case of sd_bus_message_append_string_memfd, the contents of memfd
       are the string. They must satisfy the same constraints as described
       for the "s" type in sd_bus_message_append_basic(3).
       In case of sd_bus_message_append_string_iovec, the payload of iov is
       the string. It must satisfy the same constraints as described for the
       "s" type in sd_bus_message_append_basic(3).
       The iov argument must point to nstruct iovec structures. Each
       structure may have the iov_base field set, in which case the memory
       pointed to will be copied into the message, or unset, in which case a
       block of spaces (ASCII 32) of length iov_len will be inserted. The
       memory pointed at by iov may be changed after this call.
       The sd_bus_message_append_string_space function appends space for a
       string to message m. It behaves similar to
       sd_bus_message_append_basic with type "s", but instead of copying a
       string into the message, it returns a pointer to the destination area
       to the caller in pointer p. Space for the string of length size plus
       the terminating NUL is allocated.
