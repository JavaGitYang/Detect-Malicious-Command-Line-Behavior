       These functions convert network numbers between presentation (i.e.,
       printable) format and network (i.e., binary) format.
       For both functions, af specifies the address family for the
       conversion; the only supported value is AF_INET.
   inet_net_pton()
       The inet_net_pton() function converts pres, a null-terminated string
       containing an Internet network number in presentation format to
       network format.  The result of the conversion, which is in network
       byte order, is placed in the buffer pointed to by net.  (The netp
       argument typically points to an in_addr structure.)  The nsize
       argument specifies the number of bytes available in netp.
       On success, inet_net_pton() returns the number of bits in the network
       number field of the result placed in netp.  For a discussion of the
       input presentation format and the return value, see NOTES.
       Note: the buffer pointed to by netp should be zeroed out before
       calling inet_net_pton(), since the call writes only as many bytes as
       are required for the network number (or as are explicitly specified
       by pres), which may be less than the number of bytes in a complete
       network address.
   inet_net_ntop()
       The inet_net_ntop() function converts the network number in the
       buffer pointed to by netp to presentation format; *netp is
       interpreted as a value in network byte order.  The bits argument
       specifies the number of bits in the network number in *netp.
       The null-terminated presentation-format string is placed in the
       buffer pointed to by pres.  The psize argument specifies the number
       of bytes available in pres.  The presentation string is in CIDR
       format: a dotted-decimal number representing the network address,
       followed by a slash, and the size of the network number in bits.
