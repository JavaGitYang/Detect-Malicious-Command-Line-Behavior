       systemd-ask-password-console.service is a system service that queries
       the user for system passwords (such as hard disk encryption keys and
       SSL certificate passphrases) on the console. It is intended to be
       used during boot to ensure proper handling of passwords necessary for
       boot.  systemd-ask-password-wall.service is a system service that
       informs all logged in users for system passwords via wall(1). It is
       intended to be used after boot to ensure that users are properly
       notified.
       See the developer documentation[1] for more information about the
       system password logic.
       Note that these services invoke systemd-tty-ask-password-agent(1)
       with either the --watch --console or --watch --wall command line
       parameters.
