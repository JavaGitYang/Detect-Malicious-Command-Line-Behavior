       The /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf configuration file
       specifies the way that SELinux MCS/MLS labels are translated into
       human readable form by the mcstransd daemon.  The default policies
       support 16 sensitivity levels (s0 through s15) and 1024 categories
       (c0 through c1023). Multiple categories can be separated with commas
       (c0,c1,c3,c5) and a range of categories can be shortened using dot
       notation (c0.c3,c5).
   Keywords
       Base   once a base is declared, subsequent sensitivity label
              definitions will have all modifiers applied to them during
              translation.  Sensitivity labels defined before the base
              declaration are immediately cached and no modifiers will be
              applied these are used as direct translations.
       Default
              defines the category bit range that will be used for inverse
              bits.
       Domain creates a new domain with the supplied name.
       Include
              read and process the contents of the specified configuration
              file.
       Join   defines a character used to separate members of a modifier
              group when more than one is specified (ex. USA/AUS).
       ModifierGroup
              a means of grouping category bit definitions by how they
              modify the sensitivity label.
       Prefix word(s) that may proceed member(s) of a modifier group (ex.
              REL USA).
       Suffix word(s) that may follow member(s) of a modifier group (ex. USA
              EYES ONLY).
       Whitespace
              defines the set of acceptable white space characters that may
              be used in label being translated.
   Sensitivity Level Definition Examples
       s0=SystemLow
              defines a translation of s0 (the lowest sensitivity level)
              with no categories to SystemLow.
       s15:c0.c1023=SystemHigh
              defines a translation of s15:c0.c1023 to SystemHigh. c0.c1023
              is shorthand for all categories. A colon separates the
              sensitivity level and categories.
       s0-s15:c0.c1023=SystemLow-SystemHigh
              defines a range translation of of s0-s15:c0.c1023 to
              SystemLow-SystemHigh. The two range components are separated
              by a dash.
       s0:c0=PatientRecord
              defines a translation of sensitivity s0 with category c0 to
              PatientRecord.
       s0:c1=Accounting
              defines a translation of sensitivity s0 with category c1 to
              Accounting.
       s2:c1,c2,c3=Confidential3Categories
       s2:c1.c3=Confidential3Categories
              both define a translation of sensitivity s2 with categories
              c1, c2 and c3 to Confidential3Categories.
       s5=TopSecret
              defines a translation of sensitivity s5 with no categories to
              TopSecret.
   Constraint Examples
       c0!c1  if category bits 0 and 1 are both set, the constraint will
              fail and the original context will be returned.
       c5.c9>c1
              if category bits 5 through 9 are set, bit 1 must also be set
              or the constraint will fail and the original context will be
              returned.
       s1!c5,c9
              if category bits 5 and 9 are set and the sensitivity level is
              s1, the constraint will fail and the original context will be
              returned.
