       This function sets the task attribute loginuid with the value of uid.
       The loginuid value may only be set by programs with the
       CAP_AUDIT_CONTROL capability. This normally means the root account.
       The loginuid value is part of the task structure and is inheritted by
       child processes. It is used to track what account a user gained
       system access with. All system entry point programs should set this
       value right before changing to the uid of the user granted access so
       that audit events are properly attributed to the that user.
