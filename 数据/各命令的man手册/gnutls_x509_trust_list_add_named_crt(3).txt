       This function will add the given certificate to the trusted list and
       associate it with a name. The certificate will not be be used for
       verification with gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt() but with
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_named_crt() or
       gnutls_x509_trust_list_verify_crt2() - the latter only since GnuTLS
       3.4.0 and if a hostname is provided.
       In principle this function can be used to set individual "server"
       certificates that are trusted by the user for that specific server
       but for no other purposes.
       The certificate must not be deinitialized during the lifetime of the
       trusted list.
