       mmv_lookup_value_desc searches for the value of the instance
       identified by the external instance name inst of the metric metric in
       the MMV(5) file.  addr is the address returned from mmv_stats_init().
       The pointer returned points to a pmAtomValue union, which is defined
       as follows:
           typedef union {
               __int32_t   l;      /* 32-bit signed */
               __uint32_t  ul;     /* 32-bit unsigned */
               __int64_t   ll;     /* 64-bit signed */
               __uint64_t  ull;    /* 64-bit unsigned */
               float       f;      /* 32-bit floating point */
               double      d;      /* 64-bit floating point */
               char         *cp;   /* char ptr */
            pmValueBlock *vbp;  /* pmValueBlock ptr */
           } pmAtomValue;
       MMV string values should be set using either of the mmv_set_string or
       mmv_set_strlen routines.
