       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‚Äê2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       The wmemmove() function shall copy n wide characters from the object
       pointed to by ws2 to the object pointed to by ws1.  Copying shall
       take place as if the n wide characters from the object pointed to by
       ws2 are first copied into a temporary array of n wide characters that
       does not overlap the objects pointed to by ws1 or ws2, and then the n
       wide characters from the temporary array are copied into the object
       pointed to by ws1.
       This function shall not be affected by locale and all wchar_t values
       shall be treated identically. The null wide character and wchar_t
       values not corresponding to valid characters shall not be treated
       specially.
       If n is zero, the application shall ensure that ws1 and ws2 are valid
       pointers, and the function shall copy zero wide characters.
