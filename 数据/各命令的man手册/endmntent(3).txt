       These routines are used to access the filesystem description file
       /etc/fstab and the mounted filesystem description file /etc/mtab.
       The setmntent() function opens the filesystem description file
       filename and returns a file pointer which can be used by getmntent().
       The argument type is the type of access required and can take the
       same values as the mode argument of fopen(3).
       The getmntent() function reads the next line of the filesystem
       description file from stream and returns a pointer to a structure
       containing the broken out fields from a line in the file.  The
       pointer points to a static area of memory which is overwritten by
       subsequent calls to getmntent().
       The addmntent() function adds the mntent structure mnt to the end of
       the open stream.
       The endmntent() function closes the stream associated with the
       filesystem description file.
       The hasmntopt() function scans the mnt_opts field (see below) of the
       mntent structure mnt for a substring that matches opt.  See
       <mntent.h> and mount(8) for valid mount options.
       The reentrant getmntent_r() function is similar to getmntent(), but
       stores the struct mount in the provided *mntbuf and stores the
       strings pointed to by the entries in that struct in the provided
       array buf of size buflen.
       The mntent structure is defined in <mntent.h> as follows:
           struct mntent {
               char *mnt_fsname;   /* name of mounted filesystem */
               char *mnt_dir;      /* filesystem path prefix */
               char *mnt_type;     /* mount type (see mntent.h) */
               char *mnt_opts;     /* mount options (see mntent.h) */
               int   mnt_freq;     /* dump frequency in days */
               int   mnt_passno;   /* pass number on parallel fsck */
           };
       Since fields in the mtab and fstab files are separated by whitespace,
       octal escapes are used to represent the characters space (\040), tab
       (\011), newline (\012), and backslash (\\) in those files when they
       occur in one of the four strings in a mntent structure.  The routines
       addmntent() and getmntent() will convert from string representation
       to escaped representation and back.  When converting from escaped
       representation, the sequence \134 is also converted to a backslash.
