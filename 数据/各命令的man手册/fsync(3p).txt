       The fsync() function shall request that all data for the open file
       descriptor named by fildes is to be transferred to the storage device
       associated with the file described by fildes.  The nature of the
       transfer is implementation-defined. The fsync() function shall not
       return until the system has completed that action or until an error
       is detected.
       If _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO is defined, the fsync() function shall
       force all currently queued I/O operations associated with the file
       indicated by file descriptor fildes to the synchronized I/O
       completion state. All I/O operations shall be completed as defined
       for synchronized I/O file integrity completion.
