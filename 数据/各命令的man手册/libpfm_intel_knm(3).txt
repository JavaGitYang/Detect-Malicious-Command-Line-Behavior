       The library supports the Intel Kinghts Mill core PMU. It should be
       noted that this PMU model only covers each core's PMU and not the
       socket level PMU.
       On Knights Mill, the number of generic counters is 4. There is 4-way
       HyperThreading support.  The pfm_get_pmu_info() function returns the
       maximum number of generic counters in num_cntrs.
