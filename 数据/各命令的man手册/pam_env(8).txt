       The pam_env PAM module allows the (un)setting of environment
       variables. Supported is the use of previously set environment
       variables as well as PAM_ITEMs such as PAM_RHOST.
       By default rules for (un)setting of variables are taken from the
       config file /etc/security/pam_env.conf. An alternate file can be
       specified with the conffile option.
       Second a file (/etc/environment by default) with simple KEY=VAL pairs
       on separate lines will be read. With the envfile option an alternate
       file can be specified. And with the readenv option this can be
       completly disabled.
       Third it will read a user configuration file ($HOME/.pam_environment
       by default). The default file file can be changed with the
       user_envfile option and it can be turned on and off with the
       user_readenv option.
       Since setting of PAM environment variables can have side effects to
       other modules, this module should be the last one on the stack.
