       The DB contexts backend maps from a pair of object name and class
       into security contexts. It is used to find the appropriate context
       for database objects when relabeling a certain database. The returned
       context must be freed using freecon(3).
       selabel_lookup(3) describes the function with its return and error
       codes.
       The object_name should be a fully qualified name using the hierarchy
       of database objects. For example, the pg_class table in the postgres
       database and pg_catalog schema should be qualified as:
              Bpostgres.pg_catalog.pg_class
       The NOTES section has further information on database support for
       namespace hierarchies.
       The object_type argument should be set to one of the following
       values:
              SELABEL_DB_DATABASE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     database itself, such as "postgres".
              SELABEL_DB_SCHEMA
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a schema
                     object, such as "postgres.public".
              SELABEL_DB_TABLE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a table
                     object, such as "postgres.public.my_table"
              SELABEL_DB_COLUMN
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a column
                     object, such as "postgres.public.my_table.user_id"
              SELABEL_DB_TUPLE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a table
                     object which contains the tuples to be relabeled, such
                     as "postgresql.public.my_table". Note that we have no
                     way to identify individual tuple objects, except for
                     WHERE clause on DML statements, because it has no name.
              SELABEL_DB_PROCEDURE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     procedure object, such as "postgres.public.my_func".
                     Note that we don't support lookup of individual
                     security contexts for procedures which have the same
                     name but different arguments.
              SELABEL_DB_SEQUENCE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     sequence object, such as "postgres.public.my_seq".
              SELABEL_DB_BLOB
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a large
                     object, such as "postgres.16308".  Note that a large
                     object does not have a name, so it is identified by its
                     identifier value.
              SELABEL_DB_VIEW
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a view
                     object, such as "postgres.public.my_view".
              SELABEL_DB_LANGUAGE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     language object, such as "postgres.public.tcl".
              SELABEL_DB_EXCEPTION
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a
                     exception object.
              SELABEL_DB_DATATYPE
                     The object_name argument specifies the name of a type
                     or domain object, such as postgres.public.my_type.
       Any messages generated by selabel_lookup(3) are sent to stderr by
       default, although this can be changed by selinux_set_callback(3).
       selabel_lookup_raw(3) behaves identically to selabel_lookup(3) but
       does not perform context translation.
       The FILES section details the configuration files used to determine
       the database object context.
