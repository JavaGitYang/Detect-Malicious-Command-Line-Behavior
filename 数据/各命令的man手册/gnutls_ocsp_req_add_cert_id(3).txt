       This function will add another request to the OCSP request for a
       particular certificate having the issuer name hash of
        issuer_name_hash and issuer key hash of  issuer_key_hash (both
       hashed using  digest ) and serial number  serial_number .
       The information needed corresponds to the CertID structure:
       <informalexample><programlisting> CertID      ::=     SEQUENCE {
       hashAlgorithm       AlgorithmIdentifier, issuerNameHash      OCTET
       STRING, -- Hash of Issuer's DN issuerKeyHash       OCTET STRING, --
       Hash of Issuers public key serialNumber   CertificateSerialNumber }
       </programlisting></informalexample>
