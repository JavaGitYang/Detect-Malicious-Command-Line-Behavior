     The acl_delete_perm() function deletes the permission contained in the
     argument perm (one of ACL_READ, ACL_WRITE, ACL_EXECUTE) from the per‚Äê
     mission set referred to by the argument permset_d.  An attempt to
     delete a permission that is not contained in the permission set is not
     considered an error.
     Any existing descriptors that refer to permset_d continue to refer to
     that permission set.
