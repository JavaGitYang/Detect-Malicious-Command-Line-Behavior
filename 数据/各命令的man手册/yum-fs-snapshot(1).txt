       yum-fs-snapshot(1) is a Yum plugin for taking snapshots of your
       filesystems before running a yum transaction.  By default it will
       take a snapshot of any filesystem that can be snapshotted, which
       currently is limited to BTRFS filesystems.  However, all filesystems
       built on LVM logical volumes may be snapshotted at the block level
       using LVM snapshots.  LVM snapshot support is provided for the
       purpose of system rollback.  As such LVM snapshots will only be
       created if the kernel supports the "snapshot-merge" DM target.
