       These files are used by loadkeys(1) to modify the translation tables
       used by the kernel keyboard driver and generated by dumpkeys(1) from
       those translation tables.
       The format of these files is vaguely similar to the one accepted by
       xmodmap(1).  The file consists of charset or key or string definition
       lines interspersed with comments.
       Comments are introduced with !  or # characters and continue to the
       end of the line. Anything following one of these characters on that
       line is ignored. Note that comments need not begin from column one as
       with xmodmap(1).
       The syntax of keymap files is line oriented; a complete definition
       must fit on a single logical line. Logical lines can, however, be
       split into multiple physical lines by ending each subline with the
       backslash character (\).
