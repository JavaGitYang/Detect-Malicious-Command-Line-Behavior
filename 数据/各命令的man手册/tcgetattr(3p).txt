       The tcgetattr() function shall get the parameters associated with the
       terminal referred to by fildes and store them in the termios
       structure referenced by termios_p.  The fildes argument is an open
       file descriptor associated with a terminal.
       The termios_p argument is a pointer to a termios structure.
       The tcgetattr() operation is allowed from any process.
       If the terminal device supports different input and output baud
       rates, the baud rates stored in the termios structure returned by
       tcgetattr() shall reflect the actual baud rates, even if they are
       equal. If differing baud rates are not supported, the rate returned
       as the output baud rate shall be the actual baud rate. If the
       terminal device does not support split baud rates, the input baud
       rate stored in the termios structure shall be the output rate (as one
       of the symbolic values).
