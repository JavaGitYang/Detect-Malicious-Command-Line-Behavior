       capng_name_to_capability will take the string being passed and look
       it up to see what its integer value would be. The string being input
       is the same name as the define in linux/capabiliy.h with the CAP_
       prefix removed. The string case does not matter. The integer that is
       output is the same as the define would be from linux/capabiliy.h.
       This is useful for taking string input and converting to something
       that can be used with capng_update.
