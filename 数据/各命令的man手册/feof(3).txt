       The function clearerr() clears the end-of-file and error indicators
       for the stream pointed to by stream.
       The function feof() tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream, returning nonzero if it is set.  The end-of-
       file indicator can be cleared only by the function clearerr().
       The function ferror() tests the error indicator for the stream
       pointed to by stream, returning nonzero if it is set.  The error
       indicator can be reset only by the clearerr() function.
       The function fileno() examines the argument stream and returns its
       integer file descriptor.
