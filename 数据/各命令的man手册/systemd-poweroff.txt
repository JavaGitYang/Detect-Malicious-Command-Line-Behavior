       systemd-halt.service is a system service that is pulled in by
       halt.target and is responsible for the actual system halt. Similarly,
       systemd-poweroff.service is pulled in by poweroff.target,
       systemd-reboot.service by reboot.target and systemd-kexec.service by
       kexec.target to execute the respective actions.
       When these services are run, they ensure that PID 1 is replaced by
       the /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-shutdown tool which is then responsible
       for the actual shutdown. Before shutting down, this binary will try
       to unmount all remaining file systems, disable all remaining swap
       devices, detach all remaining storage devices and kill all remaining
       processes.
       It is necessary to have this code in a separate binary because
       otherwise rebooting after an upgrade might be broken â€” the running
       PID 1 could still depend on libraries which are not available any
       more, thus keeping the file system busy, which then cannot be
       re-mounted read-only.
       Immediately before executing the actual system
       halt/poweroff/reboot/kexec systemd-shutdown will run all executables
       in /usr/lib/systemd/system-shutdown/ and pass one arguments to them:
       either "halt", "poweroff", "reboot" or "kexec", depending on the
       chosen action. All executables in this directory are executed in
       parallel, and execution of the action is not continued before all
       executables finished.
       Note that systemd-halt.service (and the related units) should never
       be executed directly. Instead, trigger system shutdown with a command
       such as "systemctl halt" or suchlike.
