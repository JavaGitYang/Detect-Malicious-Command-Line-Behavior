       The /etc/ttytype file associates termcap(5)/terminfo(5) terminal type
       names with tty lines.  Each line consists of a terminal type,
       followed by whitespace, followed by a tty name (a device name without
       the /dev/) prefix.
       This association is used by the program tset(1) to set the
       environment variable TERM to the default terminal name for the user's
       current tty.
       This facility was designed for a traditional time-sharing environment
       featuring character-cell terminals hardwired to a UNIX minicomputer.
       It is little used on modern workstation and personal UNIX systems.
