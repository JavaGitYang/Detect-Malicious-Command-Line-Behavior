       dh_installmanpages is a debhelper program that is responsible for
       automatically installing man pages into usr/share/man/ in package
       build directories.
       This is a DWIM-style program, with an interface unlike the rest of
       debhelper. It is deprecated, and you are encouraged to use
       dh_installman(1) instead.
       dh_installmanpages scans the current directory and all subdirectories
       for filenames that look like man pages. (Note that only real files
       are looked at; symlinks are ignored.) It uses file(1) to verify that
       the files are in the correct format. Then, based on the files'
       extensions, it installs them into the correct man directory.
       All filenames specified as parameters will be skipped by
       dh_installmanpages.  This is useful if by default it installs some
       man pages that you do not want to be installed.
       After the man page installation step, dh_installmanpages will check
       to see if any of the man pages are .so links. If so, it changes them
       to symlinks.
