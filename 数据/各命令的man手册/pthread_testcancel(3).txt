       Calling pthread_testcancel() creates a cancellation point within the
       calling thread, so that a thread that is otherwise executing code
       that contains no cancellation points will respond to a cancellation
       request.
       If cancelability is disabled (using pthread_setcancelstate(3)), or no
       cancellation request is pending, then a call to pthread_testcancel()
       has no effect.
