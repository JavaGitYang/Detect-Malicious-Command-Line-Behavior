     The acl_extended_file() function returns 1 if the file or directory
     referred to by the argument path_p is associated with an extended
     access ACL, or if the directory referred to by path_p is associated
     with a default ACL. The function returns 0 if the file has neither an
     extended access ACL nor a default ACL.
     An extended ACL is an ACL that contains entries other than the three
     required entries of tag types ACL_USER_OBJ, ACL_GROUP_OBJ and
     ACL_OTHER.  If the result of the acl_extended_file() function for a
     file object is 0, then ACLs define no discretionary access rights other
     than those already defined by the traditional file permission bits.
     Access to the file object may be further restricted by other mecha‐
     nisms, such as Mandatory Access Control schemes. The access(2) system
     call can be used to check whether a given type of access to a file
     object would be granted.
     acl_extended_file_nofollow() is identical to acl_extended_file(),
     except in the case of a symbolic link, where the link itself is inter‐
     rogated, not the file that it refers to.  Since symbolic links have no
     ACL themselves, the operation is supposed to fail on them.
