       The Deficit Round Robin Scheduler is a classful queuing discipline as
       a more flexible replacement for Stochastic Fairness Queuing.
       Unlike SFQ, there are no built-in queues -- you need to add classes
       and then set up filters to classify packets accordingly.  This can be
       useful e.g. for using RED qdiscs with different settings for
       particular traffic. There is no default class -- if a packet cannot
       be classified, it is dropped.
