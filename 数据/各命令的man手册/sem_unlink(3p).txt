       The sem_unlink() function shall remove the semaphore named by the
       string name.  If the semaphore named by name is currently referenced
       by other processes, then sem_unlink() shall have no effect on the
       state of the semaphore. If one or more processes have the semaphore
       open when sem_unlink() is called, destruction of the semaphore is
       postponed until all references to the semaphore have been destroyed
       by calls to sem_close(), _exit(), or exec.  Calls to sem_open() to
       recreate or reconnect to the semaphore refer to a new semaphore after
       sem_unlink() is called. The sem_unlink() call shall not block until
       all references have been destroyed; it shall return immediately.
