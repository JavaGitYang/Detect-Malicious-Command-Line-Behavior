       With this function you are allowed to override the default mutex
       locks used in some parts of gnutls and dependent libraries. This
       function should be used if you have complete control of your program
       and libraries.  Do not call this function from a library, or
       preferably from any application unless really needed to. GnuTLS will
       use the appropriate locks for the running system.
       Note that since the move to implicit initialization of GnuTLS on
       library load, calling this function will deinitialize the library,
       and re-initialize it after the new locking functions are set.
       This function must be called prior to any other gnutls function.
