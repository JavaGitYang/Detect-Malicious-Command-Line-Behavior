       The file /dev/ptmx is a character file with major number 5 and minor
       number 2, usually of mode 0666 and owner.group of root.root.  It is
       used to create a pseudoterminal master and slave pair.
       When a process opens /dev/ptmx, it gets a file descriptor for a
       pseudoterminal master (PTM), and a pseudoterminal slave (PTS) device
       is created in the /dev/pts directory.  Each file descriptor obtained
       by opening /dev/ptmx is an independent PTM with its own associated
       PTS, whose path can be found by passing the file descriptor to
       ptsname(3).
       Before opening the pseudoterminal slave, you must pass the master's
       file descriptor to grantpt(3) and unlockpt(3).
       Once both the pseudoterminal master and slave are open, the slave
       provides processes with an interface that is identical to that of a
       real terminal.
       Data written to the slave is presented on the master file descriptor
       as input.  Data written to the master is presented to the slave as
       input.
       In practice, pseudoterminals are used for implementing terminal
       emulators such as xterm(1), in which data read from the
       pseudoterminal master is interpreted by the application in the same
       way a real terminal would interpret the data, and for implementing
       remote-login programs such as sshd(8), in which data read from the
       pseudoterminal master is sent across the network to a client program
       that is connected to a terminal or terminal emulator.
       Pseudoterminals can also be used to send input to programs that
       normally refuse to read input from pipes (such as su(1), and
       passwd(1)).
