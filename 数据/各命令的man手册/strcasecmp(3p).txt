       The strcasecmp() and strcasecmp_l() functions shall compare, while
       ignoring differences in case, the string pointed to by s1 to the
       string pointed to by s2.  The strncasecmp() and strncasecmp_l()
       functions shall compare, while ignoring differences in case, not more
       than n bytes from the string pointed to by s1 to the string pointed
       to by s2.
       The strcasecmp() and strncasecmp() functions use the current locale
       to determine the case of the characters.
       The strcasecmp_l() and strncasecmp_l() functions use the locale
       represented by locale to determine the case of the characters.
       When the LC_CTYPE category of the locale being used is from the POSIX
       locale, these functions shall behave as if the strings had been
       converted to lowercase and then a byte comparison performed.
       Otherwise, the results are unspecified.
       The behavior is undefined if the locale argument to strcasecmp_l() or
       strncasecmp_l() is the special locale object LC_GLOBAL_LOCALE or is
       not a valid locale object handle.
