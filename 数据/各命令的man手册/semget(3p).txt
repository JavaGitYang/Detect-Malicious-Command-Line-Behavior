       The semget() function operates on XSI semaphores (see the Base
       Definitions volume of POSIX.1‚Äê2008, Section 4.16, Semaphore).  It is
       unspecified whether this function interoperates with the realtime
       interprocess communication facilities defined in Section 2.8,
       Realtime.
       The semget() function shall return the semaphore identifier
       associated with key.
       A semaphore identifier with its associated semid_ds data structure
       and its associated set of nsems semaphores (see <sys/sem.h>) is
       created for key if one of the following is true:
        *  The argument key is equal to IPC_PRIVATE.
        *  The argument key does not already have a semaphore identifier
           associated with it and (semflg &IPC_CREAT) is non-zero.
       Upon creation, the semid_ds data structure associated with the new
       semaphore identifier is initialized as follows:
        *  In the operation permissions structure sem_perm.cuid,
           sem_perm.uid, sem_perm.cgid, and sem_perm.gid shall be set to the
           effective user ID and effective group ID, respectively, of the
           calling process.
        *  The low-order 9 bits of sem_perm.mode shall be set to the low-
           order 9 bits of semflg.
        *  The variable sem_nsems shall be set to the value of nsems.
        *  The variable sem_otime shall be set to 0 and sem_ctime shall be
           set to the current time, as described in Section 2.7.1, IPC
           General Description.
        *  The data structure associated with each semaphore in the set need
           not be initialized. The semctl() function with the command SETVAL
           or SETALL can be used to initialize each semaphore.
