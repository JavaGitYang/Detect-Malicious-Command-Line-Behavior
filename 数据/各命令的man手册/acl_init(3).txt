     The acl_init() function allocates and initializes the working storage
     for an ACL of at least count ACL entries.  The ACL created initially
     contains no ACL entries.  A pointer to the working storage is returned.
     This function may cause memory to be allocated.  The caller should free
     any releasable memory, when the new ACL is no longer required, by call‚Äê
     ing acl_free(3) with the (void*)acl_t returned by acl_init() as an
     argument.
