       The utmp file records who is currently using the system.  The wtmp
       file records all logins and logouts.  See utmp(5).
       The function login() takes the supplied struct utmp, ut, and writes
       it to both the utmp and the wtmp file.
       The function logout() clears the entry in the utmp file again.
   GNU details
       More precisely, login() takes the argument ut struct, fills the field
       ut->ut_type (if there is such a field) with the value USER_PROCESS,
       and fills the field ut->ut_pid (if there is such a field) with the
       process ID of the calling process.  Then it tries to fill the field
       ut->ut_line.  It takes the first of stdin, stdout, stderr that is a
       terminal, and stores the corresponding pathname minus a possible
       leading /dev/ into this field, and then writes the struct to the utmp
       file.  On the other hand, if no terminal name was found, this field
       is filled with "???"  and the struct is not written to the utmp file.
       After this, the struct is written to the wtmp file.
       The logout() function searches the utmp file for an entry matching
       the ut_line argument.  If a record is found, it is updated by zeroing
       out the ut_name and ut_host fields, updating the ut_tv timestamp
       field and setting ut_type (if there is such a field) to DEAD_PROCESS.
