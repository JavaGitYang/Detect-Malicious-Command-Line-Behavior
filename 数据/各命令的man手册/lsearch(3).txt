       lfind() and lsearch() perform a linear search for key in the array
       base which has *nmemb elements of size bytes each.  The comparison
       function referenced by compar is expected to have two arguments which
       point to the key object and to an array member, in that order, and
       which returns zero if the key object matches the array member, and
       nonzero otherwise.
       If lsearch() does not find a matching element, then the key object is
       inserted at the end of the table, and *nmemb is incremented.  In
       particular, one should know that a matching element exists, or that
       more room is available.
