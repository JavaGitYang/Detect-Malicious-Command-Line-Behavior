       The iconv(3) function internally uses gconv modules to convert to and
       from a character set.  A configuration file is used to determine the
       needed modules for a conversion.  Loading and parsing such a
       configuration file would slow down programs that use iconv(3), so a
       caching mechanism is employed.
       The iconvconfig program reads iconv module configuration files and
       writes a fast-loading gconv module configuration cache file.
       In addition to the system provided gconv modules, the user can
       specify custom gconv module directories with the environment variable
       GCONV_PATH.  However, iconv module configuration caching is used only
       when the environment variable GCONV_PATH is not set.
