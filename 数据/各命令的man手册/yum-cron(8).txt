       yum-cron is an alternate interface to yum that is optimised to be
       convenient to call from cron.  It provides methods to keep repository
       metadata up to date, and to check for, download, and apply updates.
       Rather than accepting many different command line arguments, the
       different functions of yum-cron can be accessed through config files.
       config-file is used to optionally specify the path to the
       configuration file to use.  If it is not given, the default
       configuration file will be used.  It is useful to be able to specify
       different configuration files for different use cases.  For example,
       one configuration file might be set to update the repository
       metadata, and a line could be added to the crontab to run yum-cron
       frequently using this file.  Then, another configuration file might
       be set to install updates, and yum-cron could be run from cron using
       this file just once each day.
