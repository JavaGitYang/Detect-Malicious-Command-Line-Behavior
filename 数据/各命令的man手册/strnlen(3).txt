       The strnlen() function returns the number of characters in the string
       pointed to by s, excluding the terminating null byte ('\0'), but at
       most maxlen.  In doing this, strnlen() looks only at the first maxlen
       characters in the string pointed to by s and never beyond s+maxlen.
