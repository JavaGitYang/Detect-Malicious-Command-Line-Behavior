       As part of the Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) API (see
       PMDA(3)), pmdaName is the generic callback for translating a pmid
       into one or more dynamic metric names (nameset).
       Because implementing dynamic performance metrics requires specific
       PMDA support, and the facility is an optional component of a PMDA
       (most PMDAs do not support dynamic performance metrics), pmdaName is
       a skeleton implementation that returns PM_ERR_NAME.
       A PMDA that supports dynamic performance metrics will provide a
       private callback that replaces pmdaName (by assignment to
       version.four.name of the pmdaInterface structure) and implements the
       translation from a pmid to a set of dynamic performance metric names
       returned via nameset.  The behaviour, return values and memory
       allocation rules for nameset are the same as for pmNameAll(3).
