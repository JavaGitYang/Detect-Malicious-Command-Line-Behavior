       These functions are obsolete: do not use them.  Use
       pthread_attr_setstack(3) and pthread_attr_getstack(3) instead.
       The pthread_attr_setstackaddr() function sets the stack address
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr to the
       value specified in stackaddr.  This attribute specifies the location
       of the stack that should be used by a thread that is created using
       the thread attributes object attr.
       stackaddr should point to a buffer of at least PTHREAD_STACK_MIN
       bytes that was allocated by the caller.  The pages of the allocated
       buffer should be both readable and writable.
       The pthread_attr_getstackaddr() function returns the stack address
       attribute of the thread attributes object referred to by attr in the
       buffer pointed to by stackaddr.
