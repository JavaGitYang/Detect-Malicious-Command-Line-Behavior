       The library supports the Intel Ivy Bridge client part (model 58)
       uncore PMU.  The support is currently limited to the Coherency Box,
       so called C-Box for up to 4 physical cores.
       Each physical core has an associated C-Box which it uses to
       communicate with the L3 cache. The C-boxes all support the same set
       of events. However, Core 0 C-box (snb_unc_cbo0) supports an
       additional uncore clock ticks event: UNC_CLOCKTICKS.
