       showkey prints to standard output either the scan codes or the
       keycode or the `ascii' code of each key pressed.  In the first two
       modes the program runs until 10 seconds have elapsed since the last
       key press or release event, or until it receives a suitable signal,
       like SIGTERM, from another process.  In `ascii' mode the program
       terminates when the user types ^D.
       When in scancode dump mode, showkey prints in hexadecimal format each
       byte received from the keyboard to the standard output. A new line is
       printed when an interval of about 0.1 seconds occurs between the
       bytes received, or when the internal receive buffer fills up. This
       can be used to determine roughly, what byte sequences the keyboard
       sends at once on a given key press. The scan code dumping mode is
       primarily intended for debugging the keyboard driver or other low
       level interfaces. As such it shouldn't be of much interest to the
       regular end-user. However, some modern keyboards have keys or buttons
       that produce scancodes to which the kernel does not associate a
       keycode, and, after finding out what these are, the user can assign
       keycodes with setkeycodes(8).
       When in the default keycode dump mode, showkey prints to the standard
       output the keycode number or each key pressed or released. The kind
       of the event, press or release, is also reported.  Keycodes are
       numbers assigned by the kernel to each individual physical key. Every
       key has always only one associated keycode number, whether the
       keyboard sends single or multiple scan codes when pressing it. Using
       showkey in this mode, you can find out what numbers to use in your
       personalized keymap files.
       When in `ascii' dump mode, showkey prints to the standard output the
       decimal, octal, and hexadecimal value(s) of the key pressed,
       according to he present keymap.
