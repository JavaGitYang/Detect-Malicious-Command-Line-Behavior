       If the argument notification is not NULL, this function shall
       register the calling process to be notified of message arrival at an
       empty message queue associated with the specified message queue
       descriptor, mqdes.  The notification specified by the notification
       argument shall be sent to the process when the message queue
       transitions from empty to non-empty. At any time, only one process
       may be registered for notification by a message queue. If the calling
       process or any other process has already registered for notification
       of message arrival at the specified message queue, subsequent
       attempts to register for that message queue shall fail.
       If notification is NULL and the process is currently registered for
       notification by the specified message queue, the existing
       registration shall be removed.
       When the notification is sent to the registered process, its
       registration shall be removed. The message queue shall then be
       available for registration.
       If a process has registered for notification of message arrival at a
       message queue and some thread is blocked in mq_receive() or
       mq_timedreceive() waiting to receive a message when a message arrives
       at the queue, the arriving message shall satisfy the appropriate
       mq_receive() or mq_timedreceive(), respectively. The resulting
       behavior is as if the message queue remains empty, and no
       notification shall be sent.
