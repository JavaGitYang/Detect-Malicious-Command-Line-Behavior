       The getsockname() function shall retrieve the locally-bound name of
       the specified socket, store this address in the sockaddr structure
       pointed to by the address argument, and store the length of this
       address in the object pointed to by the address_len argument.
       The address_len argument points to a socklen_t object which on input
       specifies the length of the supplied sockaddr structure, and on
       output specifies the length of the stored address.  If the actual
       length of the address is greater than the length of the supplied
       sockaddr structure, the stored address shall be truncated.
       If the socket has not been bound to a local name, the value stored in
       the object pointed to by address is unspecified.
