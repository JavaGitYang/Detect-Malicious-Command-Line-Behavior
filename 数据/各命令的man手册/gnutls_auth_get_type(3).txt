       Returns type of credentials for the current authentication schema.
       The returned information is to be used to distinguish the function
       used to access authentication data.
       Eg. for CERTIFICATE ciphersuites (key exchange algorithms:
       GNUTLS_KX_RSA, GNUTLS_KX_DHE_RSA), the same function are to be used
       to access the authentication data.
