       This PMDA extracts performance data from sending the INFO command to
       a Redis (redis.io) server, which includes:
       · General information about the Redis server
       · Client connections
       · Memory consumption
       · Persistence statistics
       · Replication statistics
       · CPU consumption statistics
       · Redis command statistics
       · Redis Cluster statistics
       · Database related statistics
       The hostname (localhost), port (6379 by default) and other
       configuration information must be specified in the
       $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis/redis.conf file.
             # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
             # [ edit redis.conf ]
               host=localhost.localdomain:6379
       Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the redis
       performance metrics by doing the following as root:
             # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
             # ./Install
       To uninstall, do the following as root:
             # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/redis
             # ./Remove
       pmdaredis is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
       directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
       agent is installed or removed.
