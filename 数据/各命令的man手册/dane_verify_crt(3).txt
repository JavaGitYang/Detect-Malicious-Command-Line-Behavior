       This function will verify the given certificate chain against the CA
       constrains and/or the certificate available via DANE.  If no
       information via DANE can be obtained the flag
       DANE_VERIFY_NO_DANE_INFO is set. If a DNSSEC signature is not
       available for the DANE record then the verify flag
       DANE_VERIFY_NO_DNSSEC_DATA is set.
       Due to the many possible options of DANE, there is no single threat
       model countered. When notifying the user about DANE verification
       results it may be better to mention: DANE verification did not reject
       the certificate, rather than mentioning a successful DANE verication.
       Note that this function is designed to be run in addition to PKIX -
       certificate chain - verification. To be run independently the
       DANE_VFLAG_ONLY_CHECK_EE_USAGE flag should be specified; then the
       function will check whether the key of the peer matches the key
       advertized in the DANE entry.
