       The pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() function shall obtain the value
       of the process-shared attribute from the attributes object referenced
       by attr.  The pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() function shall set the
       process-shared attribute in an initialized attributes object
       referenced by attr.
       The process-shared attribute is set to PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED to
       permit a barrier to be operated upon by any thread that has access to
       the memory where the barrier is allocated. If the process-shared
       attribute is PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE, the barrier shall only be
       operated upon by threads created within the same process as the
       thread that initialized the barrier; if threads of different
       processes attempt to operate on such a barrier, the behavior is
       undefined. The default value of the attribute shall be
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE. Both constants PTHREAD_PROCESS_SHARED and
       PTHREAD_PROCESS_PRIVATE are defined in <pthread.h>.
       Additional attributes, their default values, and the names of the
       associated functions to get and set those attribute values are
       implementation-defined.
       The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the attr argument
       to pthread_barrierattr_getpshared() or
       pthread_barrierattr_setpshared() does not refer to an initialized
       barrier attributes object.
