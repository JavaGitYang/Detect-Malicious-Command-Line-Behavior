       userfaultfd() creates a new userfaultfd object that can be used for
       delegation of page-fault handling to a user-space application, and
       returns a file descriptor that refers to the new object.  The new
       userfaultfd object is configured using ioctl(2).
       Once the userfaultfd object is configured, the application can use
       read(2) to receive userfaultfd notifications.  The reads from
       userfaultfd may be blocking or non-blocking, depending on the value
       of flags used for the creation of the userfaultfd or subsequent calls
       to fcntl(2).
       The following values may be bitwise ORed in flags to change the
       behavior of userfaultfd():
       O_CLOEXEC
              Enable the close-on-exec flag for the new userfaultfd file
              descriptor.  See the description of the O_CLOEXEC flag in
              open(2).
       O_NONBLOCK
              Enables non-blocking operation for the userfaultfd object.
              See the description of the O_NONBLOCK flag in open(2).
       When the last file descriptor referring to a userfaultfd object is
       closed, all memory ranges that were registered with the object are
       unregistered and unread events are flushed.
   Usage
       The userfaultfd mechanism is designed to allow a thread in a
       multithreaded program to perform user-space paging for the other
       threads in the process.  When a page fault occurs for one of the
       regions registered to the userfaultfd object, the faulting thread is
       put to sleep and an event is generated that can be read via the
       userfaultfd file descriptor.  The fault-handling thread reads events
       from this file descriptor and services them using the operations
       described in ioctl_userfaultfd(2).  When servicing the page fault
       events, the fault-handling thread can trigger a wake-up for the
       sleeping thread.
       It is possible for the faulting threads and the fault-handling
       threads to run in the context of different processes.  In this case,
       these threads may belong to different programs, and the program that
       executes the faulting threads will not necessarily cooperate with the
       program that handles the page faults.  In such non-cooperative mode,
       the process that monitors userfaultfd and handles page faults needs
       to be aware of the changes in the virtual memory layout of the
       faulting process to avoid memory corruption.
       Starting from Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can also notify the fault-
       handling threads about changes in the virtual memory layout of the
       faulting process.  In addition, if the faulting process invokes
       fork(2), the userfaultfd objects associated with the parent may be
       duplicated into the child process and the userfaultfd monitor will be
       notified (via the UFFD_EVENT_FORK described below) about the file
       descriptor associated with the userfault objects created for the
       child process, which allows the userfaultfd monitor to perform user-
       space paging for the child process.  Unlike page faults which have to
       be synchronous and require an explicit or implicit wakeup, all other
       events are delivered asynchronously and the non-cooperative process
       resumes execution as soon as the userfaultfd manager executes
       read(2).  The userfaultfd manager should carefully synchronize calls
       to UFFDIO_COPY with the processing of events.
       The current asynchronous model of the event delivery is optimal for
       single threaded non-cooperative userfaultfd manager implementations.
   Userfaultfd operation
       After the userfaultfd object is created with userfaultfd(), the
       application must enable it using the UFFDIO_API ioctl(2) operation.
       This operation allows a handshake between the kernel and user space
       to determine the API version and supported features.  This operation
       must be performed before any of the other ioctl(2) operations
       described below (or those operations fail with the EINVAL error).
       After a successful UFFDIO_API operation, the application then
       registers memory address ranges using the UFFDIO_REGISTER ioctl(2)
       operation.  After successful completion of a UFFDIO_REGISTER
       operation, a page fault occurring in the requested memory range, and
       satisfying the mode defined at the registration time, will be
       forwarded by the kernel to the user-space application.  The
       application can then use the UFFDIO_COPY or UFFDIO_ZERO ioctl(2)
       operations to resolve the page fault.
       Starting from Linux 4.14, if the application sets the
       UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS feature bit using the UFFDIO_API ioctl(2), no
       page-fault notification will be forwarded to user space.  Instead a
       SIGBUS signal is delivered to the faulting process.  With this
       feature, userfaultfd can be used for robustness purposes to simply
       catch any access to areas within the registered address range that do
       not have pages allocated, without having to listen to userfaultfd
       events.  No userfaultfd monitor will be required for dealing with
       such memory accesses.  For example, this feature can be useful for
       applications that want to prevent the kernel from automatically
       allocating pages and filling holes in sparse files when the hole is
       accessed through a memory mapping.
       The UFFD_FEATURE_SIGBUS feature is implicitly inherited through
       fork(2) if used in combination with UFFD_FEATURE_FORK.
       Details of the various ioctl(2) operations can be found in
       ioctl_userfaultfd(2).
       Since Linux 4.11, events other than page-fault may enabled during
       UFFDIO_API operation.
       Up to Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can be used only with anonymous private
       memory mappings.  Since Linux 4.11, userfaultfd can be also used with
       hugetlbfs and shared memory mappings.
   Reading from the userfaultfd structure
       Each read(2) from the userfaultfd file descriptor returns one or more
       uffd_msg structures, each of which describes a page-fault event or an
       event required for the non-cooperative userfaultfd usage:
           struct uffd_msg {
               __u8  event;            /* Type of event */
               ...
               union {
                   struct {
                       __u64 flags;    /* Flags describing fault */
                       __u64 address;  /* Faulting address */
                   } pagefault;
                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u32 ufd;      /* Userfault file descriptor
                                          of the child process */
                   } fork;
                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 from;     /* Old address of remapped area */
                       __u64 to;       /* New address of remapped area */
                       __u64 len;      /* Original mapping length */
                   } remap;
                   struct {            /* Since Linux 4.11 */
                       __u64 start;    /* Start address of removed area */
                       __u64 end;      /* End address of removed area */
                   } remove;
                   ...
               } arg;
               /* Padding fields omitted */
           } __packed;
       If multiple events are available and the supplied buffer is large
       enough, read(2) returns as many events as will fit in the supplied
       buffer.  If the buffer supplied to read(2) is smaller than the size
       of the uffd_msg structure, the read(2) fails with the error EINVAL.
       The fields set in the uffd_msg structure are as follows:
       event  The type of event.  Depending of the event type, different
              fields of the arg union represent details required for the
              event processing.  The non-page-fault events are generated
              only when appropriate feature is enabled during API handshake
              with UFFDIO_API ioctl(2).
              The following values can appear in the event field:
              UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT (since Linux 4.3)
                     A page-fault event.  The page-fault details are avail‐
                     able in the pagefault field.
              UFFD_EVENT_FORK (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes fork(2) (or
                     clone(2) without the CLONE_VM flag).  The event details
                     are available in the fork field.
              UFFD_EVENT_REMAP (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes mremap(2).
                     The event details are available in the remap field.
              UFFD_EVENT_REMOVE (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process invokes madvise(2)
                     with MADV_DONTNEED or MADV_REMOVE advice.  The event
                     details are available in the remove field.
              UFFD_EVENT_UNMAP (since Linux 4.11)
                     Generated when the faulting process unmaps a memory
                     range, either explicitly using munmap(2) or implicitly
                     during mmap(2) or mremap(2).  The event details are
                     available in the remove field.
       pagefault.address
              The address that triggered the page fault.
       pagefault.flags
              A bit mask of flags that describe the event.  For
              UFFD_EVENT_PAGEFAULT, the following flag may appear:
              UFFD_PAGEFAULT_FLAG_WRITE
                     If the address is in a range that was registered with
                     the UFFDIO_REGISTER_MODE_MISSING flag (see
                     ioctl_userfaultfd(2)) and this flag is set, this a
                     write fault; otherwise it is a read fault.
       fork.ufd
              The file descriptor associated with the userfault object cre‐
              ated for the child created by fork(2).
       remap.from
              The original address of the memory range that was remapped
              using mremap(2).
       remap.to
              The new address of the memory range that was remapped using
              mremap(2).
       remap.len
              The original length of the memory range that was remapped
              using mremap(2).
       remove.start
              The start address of the memory range that was freed using
              madvise(2) or unmapped
       remove.end
              The end address of the memory range that was freed using
              madvise(2) or unmapped
       A read(2) on a userfaultfd file descriptor can fail with the follow‐
       ing errors:
       EINVAL The userfaultfd object has not yet been enabled using the UFF‐
              DIO_API ioctl(2) operation
       If the O_NONBLOCK flag is enabled in the associated open file
       description, the userfaultfd file descriptor can be monitored with
       poll(2), select(2), and epoll(7).  When events are available, the
       file descriptor indicates as readable.  If the O_NONBLOCK flag is not
       enabled, then poll(2) (always) indicates the file as having a POLLERR
       condition, and select(2) indicates the file descriptor as both read‐
       able and writable.
