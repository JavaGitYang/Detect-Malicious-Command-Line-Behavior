       The posix_spawnattr_getschedpolicy() function shall obtain the value
       of the spawn-schedpolicy attribute from the attributes object
       referenced by attr.
       The posix_spawnattr_setschedpolicy() function shall set the spawn-
       schedpolicy attribute in an initialized attributes object referenced
       by attr.
       The spawn-schedpolicy attribute represents the scheduling policy to
       be assigned to the new process image in a spawn operation (if
       POSIX_SPAWN_SETSCHEDULER is set in the spawn-flags attribute). The
       default value of this attribute is unspecified.
