       The env utility shall obtain the current environment, modify it
       according to its arguments, then invoke the utility named by the
       utility operand with the modified environment.
       Optional arguments shall be passed to utility.
       If no utility operand is specified, the resulting environment shall
       be written to the standard output, with one name=value pair per line.
       If the first argument is 'âˆ’', the results are unspecified.
