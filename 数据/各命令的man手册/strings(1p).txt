       The strings utility shall look for printable strings in regular files
       and shall write those strings to standard output. A printable string
       is any sequence of four (by default) or more printable characters
       terminated by a <newline> or NUL character. Additional
       implementation-defined strings may be written; see localedef.
       If the first argument is 'âˆ’', the results are unspecified.
