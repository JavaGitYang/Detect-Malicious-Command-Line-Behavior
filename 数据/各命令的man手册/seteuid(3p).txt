       If uid is equal to the real user ID or the saved set-user-ID, or if
       the process has appropriate privileges, seteuid() shall set the
       effective user ID of the calling process to uid; the real user ID and
       saved set-user-ID shall remain unchanged.
       The seteuid() function shall not affect the supplementary group list
       in any way.
