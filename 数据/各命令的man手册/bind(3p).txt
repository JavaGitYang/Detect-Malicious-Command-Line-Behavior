       The bind() function shall assign a local socket address address to a
       socket identified by descriptor socket that has no local socket
       address assigned. Sockets created with the socket() function are
       initially unnamed; they are identified only by their address family.
       The bind() function takes the following arguments:
       socket      Specifies the file descriptor of the socket to be bound.
       address     Points to a sockaddr structure containing the address to
                   be bound to the socket. The length and format of the
                   address depend on the address family of the socket.
       address_len Specifies the length of the sockaddr structure pointed to
                   by the address argument.
       The socket specified by socket may require the process to have
       appropriate privileges to use the bind() function.
       If the address family of the socket is AF_UNIX and the pathname in
       address names a symbolic link, bind() shall fail and set errno to
       [EADDRINUSE].
       If the socket address cannot be assigned immediately and O_NONBLOCK
       is set for the file descriptor for the socket, bind() shall fail and
       set errno to [EINPROGRESS], but the assignment request shall not be
       aborted, and the assignment shall be completed asynchronously.
       Subsequent calls to bind() for the same socket, before the assignment
       is completed, shall fail and set errno to [EALREADY].
       When the assignment has been performed asynchronously, pselect(),
       select(), and poll() shall indicate that the file descriptor for the
       socket is ready for reading and writing.
