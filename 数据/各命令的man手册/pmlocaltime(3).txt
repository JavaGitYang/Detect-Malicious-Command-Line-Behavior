       pmLocaltime is very similar to localtime(3), except the timezone used
       is the current ``reporting timezone'' (rather than the default TZ
       environment variable scheme), and the result is returned into a
       caller-declared buffer (rather than a private buffer).
       Like localtime(3) the time to be converted is passed via clock, and
       the result contains the components broken out in the elements of the
       tm struct.
       pmLocaltime returns result as the value of the function.
       The default current reporting timezone is as defined by the TZ
       environment variable, so pmLocaltime and localtime(3) will initially
       produce a similar encoding of the date and time.
       Use pmNewZone(3), pmNewContextZone(3) or pmUseZone(3) to establish a
       new current reporting timezone that will affect pmLocaltime but not
       localtime(3).
