       If the macro NDEBUG was defined at the moment <assert.h> was last
       included, the macro assert_perror() generates no code, and hence does
       nothing at all.  Otherwise, the macro assert_perror() prints an error
       message to standard error and terminates the program by calling
       abort(3) if errnum is nonzero.  The message contains the filename,
       function name and line number of the macro call, and the output of
       strerror(errnum).
