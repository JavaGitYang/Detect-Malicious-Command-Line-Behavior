       The function set_menu_format sets the maximum display size of the
       given menu.  If this size is too small to display all menu items, the
       menu will be made scrollable. If this size is larger than the menus
       subwindow and the subwindow is too small to display all menu items,
       post_menu will fail.
       The default format is 16 rows, 1 column.  Calling set_menu_format
       with a null menu pointer will change this default.  A zero row or
       column argument to set_menu_format is interpreted as a request not to
       change the current value.
       The function menu_format returns the maximum-size constraints for the
       given menu into the storage addressed by rows and cols.
