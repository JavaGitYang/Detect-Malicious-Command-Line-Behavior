       pmOpenLog reassigns the standard I/O stream oldstream to be
       associated with the file logname.  If it already exists, logname will
       be removed and recreated if possible (to ensure correct ownership and
       permissions from the caller to pmOpenLog).
       On return, the function value is the new standard I/O stream.  In the
       event of an error, this will be oldstream unchanged and status will
       be 0.
       For success, status is 1, a standard preamble is written to logname
            Log for progname on hostname started date and time
       and an atexit(3) handler is installed to write the postscript message
       to logname
            Log finished date and time
       when the processes exits.
       progname is only used to annotate messages.
