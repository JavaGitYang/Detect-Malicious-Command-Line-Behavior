       The grpck command verifies the integrity of the groups information.
       It checks that all entries in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow have the
       proper format and contain valid data. The user is prompted to delete
       entries that are improperly formatted or which have other
       uncorrectable errors.
       Checks are made to verify that each entry has:
       ·   the correct number of fields
       ·   a unique and valid group name
       ·   a valid group identifier (/etc/group only)
       ·   a valid list of members and administrators
       ·   a corresponding entry in the /etc/gshadow file (respectively
           /etc/group for the gshadow checks)
       The checks for correct number of fields and unique group name are
       fatal. If an entry has the wrong number of fields, the user will be
       prompted to delete the entire line. If the user does not answer
       affirmatively, all further checks are bypassed. An entry with a
       duplicated group name is prompted for deletion, but the remaining
       checks will still be made. All other errors are warnings and the user
       is encouraged to run the groupmod command to correct the error.
       The commands which operate on the /etc/group and /etc/gshadow files
       are not able to alter corrupted or duplicated entries.  grpck should
       be used in those circumstances to remove the offending entries.
