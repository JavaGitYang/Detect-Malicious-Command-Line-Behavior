       The functionality described on this reference page is aligned with
       the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements described
       here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008 defers to the ISO C standard.
       If s is a null pointer, the mbrtowc() function shall be equivalent to
       the call:
           mbrtowc(NULL, "", 1, ps)
       In this case, the values of the arguments pwc and n are ignored.
       If s is not a null pointer, the mbrtowc() function shall inspect at
       most n bytes beginning at the byte pointed to by s to determine the
       number of bytes needed to complete the next character (including any
       shift sequences). If the function determines that the next character
       is completed, it shall determine the value of the corresponding wide
       character and then, if pwc is not a null pointer, shall store that
       value in the object pointed to by pwc.  If the corresponding wide
       character is the null wide character, the resulting state described
       shall be the initial conversion state.
       If ps is a null pointer, the mbrtowc() function shall use its own
       internal mbstate_t object, which shall be initialized at program
       start-up to the initial conversion state. Otherwise, the mbstate_t
       object pointed to by ps shall be used to completely describe the
       current conversion state of the associated character sequence. The
       implementation shall behave as if no function defined in this volume
       of POSIX.1‐2008 calls mbrtowc().
       The behavior of this function is affected by the LC_CTYPE category of
       the current locale.
       The mbrtowc() function need not be thread-safe if called with a NULL
       ps argument.
       The mbrtowc() function shall not change the setting of errno if
       successful.
