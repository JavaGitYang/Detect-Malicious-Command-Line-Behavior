       ltrace is a program that simply runs the specified command until it
       exits.  It intercepts and records the dynamic library calls which are
       called by the executed process and the signals which are received by
       that process.  It can also intercept and print the system calls
       executed by the program.
       Its use is very similar to strace(1).
       ltrace shows parameters of invoked functions and system calls.  To
       determine what arguments each function has, it needs external
       declaration of function prototypes.  Those are stored in files called
       prototype libraries--see ltrace.conf(5) for details on the syntax of
       these files.  See the section PROTOTYPE LIBRARY DISCOVERY to learn
       how ltrace finds prototype libraries.
