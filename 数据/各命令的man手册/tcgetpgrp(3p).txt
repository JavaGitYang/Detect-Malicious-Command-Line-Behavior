       The tcgetpgrp() function shall return the value of the process group
       ID of the foreground process group associated with the terminal.
       If there is no foreground process group, tcgetpgrp() shall return a
       value greater than 1 that does not match the process group ID of any
       existing process group.
       The tcgetpgrp() function is allowed from a process that is a member
       of a background process group; however, the information may be
       subsequently changed by a process that is a member of a foreground
       process group.
