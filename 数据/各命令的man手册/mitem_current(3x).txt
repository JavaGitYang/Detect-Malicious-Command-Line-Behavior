       The function set_current_item sets the current item (the item on
       which the menu cursor is positioned).  current_item returns a pointer
       to the current item in the given menu.
       The function set_top_row sets the top row of the menu to show the
       given row (the top row is initially 0, and is reset to this value
       whenever the O_ROWMAJOR option is toggled).  The item leftmost on the
       given row becomes current.  The function top_row returns the number
       of the top menu row being displayed.
       The function item_index returns the (zero-origin) index of item in
       the menu's item pointer list.
