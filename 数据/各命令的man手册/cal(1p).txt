       The cal utility shall write a calendar to standard output using the
       Julian calendar for dates from January 1, 1 through September 2, 1752
       and the Gregorian calendar for dates from September 14, 1752 through
       December 31, 9999 as though the Gregorian calendar had been adopted
       on September 14, 1752.
       If no operands are given, cal shall produce a one-month calendar for
       the current month in the current year. If only the year operand is
       given, cal shall produce a calendar for all twelve months in the
       given calendar year. If both month and year operands are given, cal
       shall produce a one-month calendar for the given month in the given
       year.
