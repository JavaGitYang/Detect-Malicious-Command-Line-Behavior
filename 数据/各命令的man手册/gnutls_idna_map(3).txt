       This function will convert the provided UTF-8 domain name, to its
       IDNA mapping in an allocated variable. Note that depending on the
       flags the used gnutls library was compiled with, the output of this
       function may vary (i.e., may be IDNA2008, or IDNA2003).
       To force IDNA2008 specify the flag GNUTLS_IDNA_FORCE_2008. In the
       case GnuTLS is not compiled with the necessary dependencies,
       GNUTLS_E_UNIMPLEMENTED_FEATURE will be returned to indicate that
       gnutls is unable to perform the requested conversion.
       Note also, that this function will return an empty string if an empty
       string is provided as input.
