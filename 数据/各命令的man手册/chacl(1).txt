       chacl is an IRIX-compatibility command, and is maintained for those
       users who are familiar with its use from either XFS or IRIX.  Refer
       to the SEE ALSO section below for a description of tools which
       conform more closely to the (withdrawn draft) POSIX 1003.1e standard
       which describes Access Control Lists (ACLs).
       chacl changes the ACL(s) for a file or directory.  The ACL(s)
       specified are applied to each file in the pathname arguments.
       Each ACL is a string which is interpreted using the acl_from_text(3)
       routine.  These strings are made up of comma separated clauses each
       of which is of the form, tag:name:perm.  Where tag can be:
       "user" (or "u")
              indicating that the entry is a user ACL entry.
       "group" (or "g")
              indicating that the entry is a group ACL entry.
       "other" (or "o")
              indicating that the entry is an other ACL entry.
       "mask" (or "m")
              indicating that the entry is a mask ACL entry.
       name is a string which is the user or group name for the ACL entry.
       A null name in a user or group ACL entry indicates the file's owner
       or file's group.  perm is the string "rwx" where each of the entries
       may be replaced by a "-" indicating no access of that type, e.g.
       "r-x", "--x", "---".
