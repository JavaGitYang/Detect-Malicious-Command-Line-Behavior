       btrfs filesystem is used to perform several whole filesystem level
       tasks, including all the regular filesystem operations like resizing,
       space stats, label setting/getting, and defragmentation. There are
       other whole filesystem tasks like scrub or balance that are grouped
       in separate commands.
