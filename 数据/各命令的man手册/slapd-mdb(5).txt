       The mdb backend to slapd(8) uses OpenLDAP's Lightning Memory-Mapped
       DB (LMDB) library to store data.  It relies completely on the
       underlying operating system for memory management and does no caching
       of its own. It is the recommended primary database backend.
       The mdb backend is similar to the hdb backend in that it uses a
       hierarchical database layout which supports subtree renames. It is
       both more space-efficient and more execution-efficient than the bdb
       backend, while being overall much simpler to manage.
