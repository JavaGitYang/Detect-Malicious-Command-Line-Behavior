       The pidstat command is used for monitoring individual tasks currently
       being managed by the Linux kernel.  It writes to standard output
       activities for every task selected with option -p or for every task
       managed by the Linux kernel if option -p ALL has been used. Not
       selecting any tasks is equivalent to specifying -p ALL but only
       active tasks (tasks with non-zero statistics values) will appear in
       the report.
       The pidstat command can also be used for monitoring the child
       processes of selected tasks.  Read about option -T below.
       The interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds
       between each report.  A value of 0 (or no parameters at all)
       indicates that tasks statistics are to be reported for the time since
       system startup (boot).  The count parameter can be specified in
       conjunction with the interval parameter if this one is not set to
       zero. The value of count determines the number of reports generated
       at interval seconds apart. If the interval parameter is specified
       without the count parameter, the pidstat command generates reports
       continuously.
       You can select information about specific task activities using
       flags.  Not specifying any flags selects only CPU activity.
