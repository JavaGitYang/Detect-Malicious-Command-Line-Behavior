       The chown utility shall set the user ID of the file named by each
       file operand to the user ID specified by the owner operand.
       For each file operand, or, if the −R option is used, each file
       encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the file
       operands, the chown utility shall perform actions equivalent to the
       chown() function defined in the System Interfaces volume of
       POSIX.1‐2008, called with the following arguments:
        1. The file operand shall be used as the path argument.
        2. The user ID indicated by the owner portion of the first operand
           shall be used as the owner argument.
        3. If the group portion of the first operand is given, the group ID
           indicated by it shall be used as the group argument; otherwise,
           the group ownership shall not be changed.
       Unless chown is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges, the
       set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be cleared
       upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of
       other file types may be cleared.
