       This function will try to find a certificate that is associated with
       the provided name --see gnutls_x509_trust_list_add_named_crt(). If a
       match is found the certificate is considered valid. In addition to
       that this function will also check CRLs. The  voutput parameter will
       hold an OR'ed sequence of gnutls_certificate_status_t flags.
       Additionally a certificate verification profile can be specified from
       the ones in gnutls_certificate_verification_profiles_t by ORing the
       result of GNUTLS_PROFILE_TO_VFLAGS() to the verification flags.
