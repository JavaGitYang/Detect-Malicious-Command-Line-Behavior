       /dev/vcs0 is a character device with major number 7 and minor number
       0, usually of mode 0644 and owner root.tty.  It refers to the memory
       of the currently displayed virtual console terminal.
       /dev/vcs[1-63] are character devices for virtual console terminals,
       they have major number 7 and minor number 1 to 63, usually mode 0644
       and owner root.tty.  /dev/vcsa[0-63] are the same, but using unsigned
       shorts (in host byte order) that include attributes, and prefixed
       with four bytes giving the screen dimensions and cursor position:
       lines, columns, x, y.  (x = y = 0 at the top left corner of the
       screen.)
       When a 512-character font is loaded, the 9th bit position can be
       fetched by applying the ioctl(2) VT_GETHIFONTMASK operation
       (available in Linux kernels 2.6.18 and above) on /dev/tty[1-63]; the
       value is returned in the unsigned short pointed to by the third
       ioctl(2) argument.
       These devices replace the screendump ioctl(2) operations of
       ioctl_console(2), so the system administrator can control access
       using filesystem permissions.
       The devices for the first eight virtual consoles may be created by:
           for x in 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8; do
               mknod -m 644 /dev/vcs$x c 7 $x;
               mknod -m 644 /dev/vcsa$x c 7 $[$x+128];
           done
           chown root:tty /dev/vcs*
       No ioctl(2) requests are supported.
