       pmdadm is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
       metric values for Device Mapper on the local system.
       This PMDA collects its data through the dmsetup(8) utility, dmstats
       API and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
       In addition, at least a statistics region must be created to use
       dmstats(8) in order to get the basic counter value.
       Further details on device mapper can be found at http://redhat.com
