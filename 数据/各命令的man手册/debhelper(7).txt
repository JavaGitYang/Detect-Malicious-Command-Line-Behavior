       Debhelper is used to help you build a Debian package. The philosophy
       behind debhelper is to provide a collection of small, simple, and
       easily understood tools that are used in debian/rules to automate
       various common aspects of building a package. This means less work
       for you, the packager.  It also, to some degree means that these
       tools can be changed if Debian policy changes, and packages that use
       them will require only a rebuild to comply with the new policy.
       A typical debian/rules file that uses debhelper will call several
       debhelper commands in sequence, or use dh(1) to automate this
       process. Examples of rules files that use debhelper are in
       /usr/share/doc/debhelper/examples/
       To create a new Debian package using debhelper, you can just copy one
       of the sample rules files and edit it by hand. Or you can try the dh-
       make package, which contains a dh_make command that partially
       automates the process. For a more gentle introduction, the maint-
       guide Debian package contains a tutorial about making your first
       package using debhelper.
       Except where tool explicitly denotes otherwise, all of the debhelper
       tools assumes that they run from root directory of an unpacked source
       package.  This is so they can locate find debian/control and
       debian/compat when needed.
