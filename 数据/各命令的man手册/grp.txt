       The <grp.h> header shall declare the group structure, which shall
       include the following members:
           char   *gr_name The name of the group.
           gid_t   gr_gid  Numerical group ID.
           char  **gr_mem  Pointer to a null-terminated array of character
                           pointers to member names.
       The <grp.h> header shall define the gid_t and size_t types as
       described in <sys/types.h>.
       The following shall be declared as functions and may also be defined
       as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.
           void           endgrent(void);
           struct group  *getgrent(void);
           struct group  *getgrgid(gid_t);
           int            getgrgid_r(gid_t, struct group *, char *,
                              size_t, struct group **);
           struct group  *getgrnam(const char *);
           int            getgrnam_r(const char *, struct group *, char *,
                              size_t , struct group **);
           void           setgrent(void);
