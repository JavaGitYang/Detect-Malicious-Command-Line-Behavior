       Look up the full path of the directory entry specified by the value
       cookie.  The cookie is an opaque identifier uniquely identifying a
       particular directory entry.  The buffer given is filled in with the
       full path of the directory entry.
       For lookup_dcookie() to return successfully, the kernel must still
       hold a cookie reference to the directory entry.
