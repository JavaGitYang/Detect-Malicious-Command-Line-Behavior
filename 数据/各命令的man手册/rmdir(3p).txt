       The rmdir() function shall remove a directory whose name is given by
       path.  The directory shall be removed only if it is an empty
       directory.
       If the directory is the root directory or the current working
       directory of any process, it is unspecified whether the function
       succeeds, or whether it shall fail and set errno to [EBUSY].
       If path names a symbolic link, then rmdir() shall fail and set errno
       to [ENOTDIR].
       If the path argument refers to a path whose final component is either
       dot or dot-dot, rmdir() shall fail.
       If the directory's link count becomes 0 and no process has the
       directory open, the space occupied by the directory shall be freed
       and the directory shall no longer be accessible. If one or more
       processes have the directory open when the last link is removed, the
       dot and dot-dot entries, if present, shall be removed before rmdir()
       returns and no new entries may be created in the directory, but the
       directory shall not be removed until all references to the directory
       are closed.
       If the directory is not an empty directory, rmdir() shall fail and
       set errno to [EEXIST] or [ENOTEMPTY].
       Upon successful completion, rmdir() shall mark for update the last
       data modification and last file status change timestamps of the
       parent directory.
