       Computes the object ID value for an object with specified type with
       the contents of the named file (which can be outside of the work
       tree), and optionally writes the resulting object into the object
       database. Reports its object ID to its standard output. This is used
       by git cvsimport to update the index without modifying files in the
       work tree. When <type> is not specified, it defaults to "blob".
