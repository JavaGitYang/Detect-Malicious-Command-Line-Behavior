       The continue utility shall return to the top of the smallest
       enclosing for, while, or until loop, or to the top of the nth
       enclosing loop, if n is specified. This involves repeating the
       condition list of a while or until loop or performing the next
       assignment of a for loop, and re-executing the loop if appropriate.
       The value of n is a decimal integer greater than or equal to 1. The
       default shall be equivalent to n=1.  If n is greater than the number
       of enclosing loops, the outermost enclosing loop shall be used.
