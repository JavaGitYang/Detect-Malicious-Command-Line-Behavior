       mysql_fix_extensions converts the extensions for MyISAM (or ISAM)
       table files to their canonical forms. It looks for files with
       extensions matching any lettercase variant of .frm, .myd, .myi, .isd,
       and .ism and renames them to have extensions of .frm, .MYD, .MYI,
       .ISD, and .ISM, respectively. This can be useful after transferring
       the files from a system with case-insensitive file names (such as
       Windows) to a system with case-sensitive file names.
       Invoke mysql_fix_extensions like this, where data_dir is the path
       name to the MySQL data directory.
           shell> mysql_fix_extensions data_dir
