       A dumb server that does not do on-the-fly pack generations must have
       some auxiliary information files in $GIT_DIR/info and
       $GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY/info directories to help clients discover what
       references and packs the server has. This command generates such
       auxiliary files.
