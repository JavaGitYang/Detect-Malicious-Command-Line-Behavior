       Use git stash when you want to record the current state of the
       working directory and the index, but want to go back to a clean
       working directory. The command saves your local modifications away
       and reverts the working directory to match the HEAD commit.
       The modifications stashed away by this command can be listed with git
       stash list, inspected with git stash show, and restored (potentially
       on top of a different commit) with git stash apply. Calling git stash
       without any arguments is equivalent to git stash push. A stash is by
       default listed as "WIP on branchname ...", but you can give a more
       descriptive message on the command line when you create one.
       The latest stash you created is stored in refs/stash; older stashes
       are found in the reflog of this reference and can be named using the
       usual reflog syntax (e.g. stash@{0} is the most recently created
       stash, stash@{1} is the one before it, stash@{2.hours.ago} is also
       possible). Stashes may also be referenced by specifying just the
       stash index (e.g. the integer n is equivalent to stash@{n}).
