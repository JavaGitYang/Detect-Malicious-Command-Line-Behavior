       Files in this directory determine the default behavior for utilities
       when coloring output.
       The name is a utility name.  The name is optional and when none is
       specified then the file is used for all unspecified utilities.
       The term is a terminal identifier (the TERM environment variable).
       The terminal identifier is optional and when none is specified then
       the file is used for all unspecified terminals.
       The type is a file type.  Supported file types are:
       disable
              Turns off output colorization for all compatible utilities.
       enable Turns on output colorization; any matching disable files are
              ignored.
       scheme Specifies colors used for output.  The file format may be
              specific to the utility, the default format is described
              below.
       If there are more files that match for a utility, then the file with
       the more specific filename wins.  For example, the filename
       "@xterm.scheme" has less priority than "dmesg@xterm.scheme".  The
       lowest priority are those files without a utility name and terminal
       identifier (e.g. "disable").
       The user-specific $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/terminal-colors.d or
       $HOME/.config/terminal-colors.d overrides the global setting.
