       The getpwuid() function shall search the user database for an entry
       with a matching uid.
       The getpwuid() function need not be thread-safe.
       Applications wishing to check for error situations should set errno
       to 0 before calling getpwuid().  If getpwuid() returns a null pointer
       and errno is set to non-zero, an error occurred.
       The getpwuid_r() function shall update the passwd structure pointed
       to by pwd and store a pointer to that structure at the location
       pointed to by result.  The structure shall contain an entry from the
       user database with a matching uid.  Storage referenced by the
       structure is allocated from the memory provided with the buffer
       parameter, which is bufsize bytes in size. A call to
       sysconf(_SC_GETPW_R_SIZE_MAX) returns either âˆ’1 without changing
       errno or an initial value suggested for the size of this buffer.  A
       null pointer shall be returned at the location pointed to by result
       on error or if the requested entry is not found.
