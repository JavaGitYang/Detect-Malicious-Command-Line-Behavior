       The fdatasync() function shall force all currently queued I/O
       operations associated with the file indicated by file descriptor
       fildes to the synchronized I/O completion state.
       The functionality shall be equivalent to fsync() with the symbol
       _POSIX_SYNCHRONIZED_IO defined, with the exception that all I/O
       operations shall be completed as defined for synchronized I/O data
       integrity completion.
