       The filesystem checker is used to verify structural integrity of a
       filesystem and attempt to repair it if requested. It is recommended
       to unmount the filesystem prior to running the check, but it is
       possible to start checking a mounted filesystem (see --force).
       By default, btrfs check will not modify the device but you can
       reaffirm that by the option --readonly.
       btrfsck is an alias of btrfs check command and is now deprecated.
           Warning
           Do not use --repair unless you are advised to do so by a
           developer or an experienced user, and then only after having
           accepted that no fsck successfully repair all types of filesystem
           corruption. Eg. some other software or hardware bugs can fatally
           damage a volume.
       The structural integrity check verifies if internal filesystem
       objects or data structures satisfy the constraints, point to the
       right objects or are correctly connected together.
       There are several cross checks that can detect wrong reference counts
       of shared extents, backreferences, missing extents of inodes,
       directory and inode connectivity etc.
       The amount of memory required can be high, depending on the size of
       the filesystem, similarly the run time.
