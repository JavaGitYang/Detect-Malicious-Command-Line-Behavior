       nmap-update is an updater for Nmap's architecture-independent files.
       It is used to keep up to date with changes and new scripts for the
       Nmap Scripting Engine.
       Updates are distributed in the form of “channels”, which are named
       directories that usually correspond to Nmap version numbers. When
       nmap-update is installed, it will pull from the channel corresponding
       to the version of Nmap it was installed with, until Nmap and
       nmap-update are upgraded as a whole.
       The program works by updating from a remote Subversion repository. To
       supply authentication credentials, create a configuration file:
           The contents of the file should be:
               username = username
               password = password
           Alternatively, you can cache your credentials more securely if
           you have the svn command-line program installed. Run the command
           svn ls https://svn.nmap.org/updates, enter your credentials, and
           agree to cache them when asked.
