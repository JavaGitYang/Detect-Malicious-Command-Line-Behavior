       The <errno.h> header file defines the integer variable errno, which
       is set by system calls and some library functions in the event of an
       error to indicate what went wrong.
   errno
       The value in errno is significant only when the return value of the
       call indicated an error (i.e., -1 from most system calls; -1 or NULL
       from most library functions); a function that succeeds is allowed to
       change errno.  The value of errno is never set to zero by any system
       call or library function.
       For some system calls and library functions (e.g., getpriority(2)),
       -1 is a valid return on success.  In such cases, a successful return
       can be distinguished from an error return by setting errno to zero
       before the call, and then, if the call returns a status that
       indicates that an error may have occurred, checking to see if errno
       has a nonzero value.
       errno is defined by the ISO C standard to be a modifiable lvalue of
       type int, and must not be explicitly declared; errno may be a macro.
       errno is thread-local; setting it in one thread does not affect its
       value in any other thread.
   Error numbers and names
       Valid error numbers are all positive numbers.  The <errno.h> header
       file defines symbolic names for each of the possible error numbers
       that may appear in errno.
       All the error names specified by POSIX.1 must have distinct values,
       with the exception of EAGAIN and EWOULDBLOCK, which may be the same.
       The error numbers that correspond to each symbolic name vary across
       UNIX systems, and even across different architectures on Linux.
       Therefore, numeric values are not included as part of the list of
       error names below.  The perror(3) and strerror(3) functions can be
       used to convert these names to corresponding textual error messages.
       On any particular Linux system, one can obtain a list of all symbolic
       error names and the corresponding error numbers using the errno(1)
       command:
           $ errno -l
           EPERM 1 Operation not permitted
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           EINTR 4 Interrupted system call
           EIO 5 Input/output error
           ...
       The errno(1) command can also be used to look up individual error
       numbers and names, and to search for errors using strings from the
       error description, as in the following examples:
           $ errno 2
           ENOENT 2 No such file or directory
           $ errno ESRCH
           ESRCH 3 No such process
           $ errno -s permission
           EACCES 13 Permission denied
   List of error names
       In the list of the symbolic error names below, various names are
       marked as follows:
       *  POSIX.1-2001: The name is defined by POSIX.1-2001, and is defined
          in later POSIX.1 versions, unless otherwise indicated.
       *  POSIX.1-2008: The name is defined in POSIX.1-2008, but was not
          present in earlier POSIX.1 standards.
       *  C99: The name is defined by C99.  Below is a list of the symbolic
