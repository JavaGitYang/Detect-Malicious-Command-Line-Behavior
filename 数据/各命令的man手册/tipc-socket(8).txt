       A TIPC socket is represented by an unsigned integer.
          Bound state
              A bound socket has a logical TIPC port name associated with
              it.
          Connected state
              A connected socket is directly connected to another socket
              creating a point to point connection between TIPC sockets. If
              the connection to X was made using a logical port name Y that
              name will show up as connected to X via Y
