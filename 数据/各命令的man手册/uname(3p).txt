       The uname() function shall store information identifying the current
       system in the structure pointed to by name.
       The uname() function uses the utsname structure defined in
       <sys/utsname.h>.
       The uname() function shall return a string naming the current system
       in the character array sysname.  Similarly, nodename shall contain
       the name of this node within an implementation-defined communications
       network. The arrays release and version shall further identify the
       operating system. The array machine shall contain a name that
       identifies the hardware that the system is running on.
       The format of each member is implementation-defined.
