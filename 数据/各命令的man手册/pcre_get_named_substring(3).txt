       This is a convenience function for extracting a captured substring by
       name. The arguments are:
         code          Compiled pattern
         subject       Subject that has been successfully matched
         ovector       Offset vector that pcre[16|32]_exec() used
         stringcount   Value returned by pcre[16|32]_exec()
         stringname    Name of the required substring
         stringptr     Where to put the string pointer
       The memory in which the substring is placed is obtained by calling
       pcre[16|32]_malloc(). The convenience function
       pcre[16|32]_free_substring() can be used to free it when it is no
       longer needed. The yield of the function is the length of the
       extracted substring, PCRE_ERROR_NOMEMORY if sufficient memory could
       not be obtained, or PCRE_ERROR_NOSUBSTRING if the string name is
       invalid.
       There is a complete description of the PCRE native API in the pcreapi
       page and a description of the POSIX API in the pcreposix page.
