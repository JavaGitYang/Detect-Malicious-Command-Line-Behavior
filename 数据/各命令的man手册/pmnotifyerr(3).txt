       These routines provide standard handling for error messages from
       within the internals of Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) daemons and
       Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDAs).
       pmNotifyErr is a printf(3) style function that will format message
       (and any subsequent arguments) with a prefix that includes the
       current date and time from ctime(3), the name of the application from
       pmGetProgname(3), the process's id from getpid(2) and the priority.
       priority should be one of the level LOG_ macros defined for
       syslog(3).  Most typically this would be LOG_INFO, LOG_WARNING or
       LOG_ERR.
       pmNotifyErr writes to standard error, which for daemons and PMDAs has
       most likely been redirected to a log file using pmOpenLog(3).
       Additionally message (and any subsequent arguments) may be sent
       forwarded to syslog(3) if pmSyslog has previously been called with
       onoff having a non-zero value.
       Forwarding to syslog(3) can be disabled at any time by calling
       pmSyslog with onoff having a zero value, and this is the starting
       state for each PCP application.
