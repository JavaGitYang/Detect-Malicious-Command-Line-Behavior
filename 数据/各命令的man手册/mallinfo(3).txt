       The mallinfo() function returns a copy of a structure containing
       information about memory allocations performed by malloc(3) and
       related functions.  This structure is defined as follows:
           struct mallinfo {
               int arena;     /* Non-mmapped space allocated (bytes) */
               int ordblks;   /* Number of free chunks */
               int smblks;    /* Number of free fastbin blocks */
               int hblks;     /* Number of mmapped regions */
               int hblkhd;    /* Space allocated in mmapped regions (bytes) */
               int usmblks;   /* Maximum total allocated space (bytes) */
               int fsmblks;   /* Space in freed fastbin blocks (bytes) */
               int uordblks;  /* Total allocated space (bytes) */
               int fordblks;  /* Total free space (bytes) */
               int keepcost;  /* Top-most, releasable space (bytes) */
           };
       The fields of the mallinfo structure contain the following informa‐
       tion:
       arena     The total amount of memory allocated by means other than
                 mmap(2) (i.e., memory allocated on the heap).  This figure
                 includes both in-use blocks and blocks on the free list.
       ordblks   The number of ordinary (i.e., non-fastbin) free blocks.
       smblks    The number of fastbin free blocks (see mallopt(3)).
       hblks     The number of blocks currently allocated using mmap(2).
                 (See the discussion of M_MMAP_THRESHOLD in mallopt(3).)
       hblkhd    The number of bytes in blocks currently allocated using
                 mmap(2).
       usmblks   The "highwater mark" for allocated space—that is, the maxi‐
                 mum amount of space that was ever allocated.  This field is
                 maintained only in nonthreading environments.
       fsmblks   The total number of bytes in fastbin free blocks.
       uordblks  The total number of bytes used by in-use allocations.
       fordblks  The total number of bytes in free blocks.
       keepcost  The total amount of releasable free space at the top of the
                 heap.  This is the maximum number of bytes that could ide‐
                 ally (i.e., ignoring page alignment restrictions, and so
                 on) be released by malloc_trim(3).
