       ustat() returns information about a mounted filesystem.  dev is a
       device number identifying a device containing a mounted filesystem.
       ubuf is a pointer to a ustat structure that contains the following
       members:
           daddr_t f_tfree;      /* Total free blocks */
           ino_t   f_tinode;     /* Number of free inodes */
           char    f_fname[6];   /* Filsys name */
           char    f_fpack[6];   /* Filsys pack name */
       The last two fields, f_fname and f_fpack, are not implemented and
       will always be filled with null bytes ('\0').
