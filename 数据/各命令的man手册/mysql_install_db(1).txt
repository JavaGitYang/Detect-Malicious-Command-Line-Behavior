       mysql_install_db initializes the MariaDB data directory and creates
       the system tables that it contains, if they do not exist.
       To invoke mysql_install_db, use the following syntax:
           shell> mysql_install_db [options]
       Because the MariaDB server, mysqld, needs to access the data
       directory when it runs later, you should either run mysql_install_db
       from the same account that will be used for running mysqld or run it
       as root and use the --user option to indicate the user name that
       mysqld will run as. It might be necessary to specify other options
       such as --basedir or --datadir if mysql_install_db does not use the
       correct locations for the installation directory or data directory.
       For example:
           shell> bin/mysql_install_db --user=mysql \
                    --basedir=/opt/mysql/mysql \
                    --datadir=/opt/mysql/mysql/data
       mysql_install_db needs to invoke mysqld with the --bootstrap and
       --skip-grant-tables options (see Section 2.3.2, “Typical configure
       Options”). If MariaDB was configured with the --disable-grant-options
       option, --bootstrap and --skip-grant-tables will be disabled. To
       handle this, set the MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP environment variable to the
       full path name of a server that has all options enabled.
       mysql_install_db will use that server.
       mysql_install_db supports the following options, which can be
       specified on the command line or in the [mysql_install_db] and (if
       they are common to mysqld) [mysqld] option file groups.
       ·   --basedir=path
           The path to the MariaDB installation directory.
       ·   --builddir=path
           If using --srcdir with out-of-directory builds, you will need to
           set this to the location of the build directory where built files
           reside..
       ·   --cross-bootstrap
           For internal use. Used when building the MariaDB system tables on
           a different host than the target..
       ·   --datadir=path, --ldata=path
           The path to the MariaDB data directory.
       ·   --defaults-extra-file=filename
           Set filename as the file to read default options from after the
           global defaults files has been read.  Must be given as first
           option.
       ·   --defaults-file=filename
           Set filename as the file to read default options from, override
           global defaults files.  Must be given as first option.
       ·   --force
           Cause mysql_install_db to run even if DNS does not work. In that
           case, grant table entries that normally use host names will use
           IP addresses.
       ·   --help
           Display a help message and exit.
       ·   --no-defaults
           Do not read default options from any option file. This must be
           given as the first argument.
       ·   --print-defaults
           Print the program argument list and exit.  This must be given as
           the first argument.
       ·   --rpm
           For internal use. This option is used by RPM files during the
           MariaDB installation process.
       ·   --skip-name-resolve
           Use IP addresses rather than host names when creating grant table
           entries. This option can be useful if your DNS does not work.
       ·   --srcdir=path
           For internal use. The directory under which mysql_install_db
           looks for support files such as the error message file and the
           file for populating the help tables.4.
       ·   --user=user_name
           The login user name to use for running mysqld. Files and
           directories created by mysqld will be owned by this user. You
           must be root to use this option. By default, mysqld runs using
           your current login name and files and directories that it creates
           will be owned by you.
       ·   --verbose
           Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program does.
       ·   --windows
           For internal use. This option is used for creating Windows
           distributions.
