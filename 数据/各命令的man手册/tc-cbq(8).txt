       Class Based Queueing is a classful qdisc that implements a rich
       linksharing hierarchy of classes. It contains shaping elements as
       well as prioritizing capabilities. Shaping is performed using link
       idle time calculations based on the timing of dequeue events and
       underlying link bandwidth.
