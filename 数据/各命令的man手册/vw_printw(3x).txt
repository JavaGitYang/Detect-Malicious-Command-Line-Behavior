       The printw, wprintw, mvprintw and mvwprintw routines are analogous to
       printf [see printf(3)].  In effect, the string that would be output
       by printf is output instead as though waddstr were used on the given
       window.
       The vwprintw and wv_printw routines are analogous to vprintf [see
       printf(3)] and perform a wprintw using a variable argument list.  The
       third argument is a va_list, a pointer to a list of arguments, as
       defined in <stdarg.h>.
