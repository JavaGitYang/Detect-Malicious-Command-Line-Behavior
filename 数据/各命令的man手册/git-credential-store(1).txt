           Note
           Using this helper will store your passwords unencrypted on disk,
           protected only by filesystem permissions. If this is not an
           acceptable security tradeoff, try git-credential-cache(1), or
           find a helper that integrates with secure storage provided by
           your operating system.
       This command stores credentials indefinitely on disk for use by
       future Git programs.
       You probably donâ€™t want to invoke this command directly; it is meant
       to be used as a credential helper by other parts of git. See
       gitcredentials(7) or EXAMPLES below.
