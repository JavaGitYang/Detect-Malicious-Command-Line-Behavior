       The command finds the most recent tag that is reachable from a
       commit. If the tag points to the commit, then only the tag is shown.
       Otherwise, it suffixes the tag name with the number of additional
       commits on top of the tagged object and the abbreviated object name
       of the most recent commit.
       By default (without --all or --tags) git describe only shows
       annotated tags. For more information about creating annotated tags
       see the -a and -s options to git-tag(1).
       If the given object refers to a blob, it will be described as
       <commit-ish>:<path>, such that the blob can be found at <path> in the
       <commit-ish>, which itself describes the first commit in which this
       blob occurs in a reverse revision walk from HEAD.
