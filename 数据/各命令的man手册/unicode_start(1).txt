       The unicode_start command will put the keyboard and console into
       Unicode (UTF-8) mode.
       For the keyboard this means that one can attach 16-bit U+xxxx values
       to keyboard keys using loadkeys(1), and have these appear as UTF-8
       input to user programs.  Also, that one can type hexadecimal Alt-xxxx
       using the numeric keypad, and again produce UTF-8.
       For the console this means that the kernel expects UTF-8 output from
       user programs, and displays the output accordingly.
       The parameter font is a font that is loaded. It should have a built-
       in Unicode map, or, if it hasn't, such a map can be given explicitly
       as second parameter.  When no font was specified, the current font is
       kept.
