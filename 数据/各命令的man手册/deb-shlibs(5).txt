       shlibs files map shared library names and versions (sonames) to
       dependencies suitable for a package control file.  There is one entry
       per line. Blank lines are not allowed.  Lines beginning with an #
       character are considered commentary, and are ignored.  All other
       lines must have the format
              [type:] library version dependencies
       The library and version fields are whitespace-delimited, but the
       dependencies field extends to the end of the line.  The type field is
       optional and normally not needed.
       The dependencies field has the same syntax as the Depends field in a
       binary control file, see deb-control(5).
