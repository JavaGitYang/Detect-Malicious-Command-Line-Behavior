       xfs_repair repairs corrupt or damaged XFS filesystems (see xfs(5)).
       The filesystem is specified using the device argument which should be
       the device name of the disk partition or volume containing the
       filesystem. If given the name of a block device, xfs_repair will
       attempt to find the raw device associated with the specified block
       device and will use the raw device instead.
       Regardless, the filesystem to be repaired must be unmounted,
       otherwise, the resulting filesystem may be inconsistent or corrupt.
