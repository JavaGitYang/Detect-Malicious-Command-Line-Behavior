       resolve_stack_dump resolves a numeric stack dump to symbols.
       Invoke resolve_stack_dump like this:
           shell> resolve_stack_dump [options] symbols_file [numeric_dump_file]
       The symbols file should include the output from the nm --numeric-sort
       mysqld command. The numeric dump file should contain a numeric stack
       track from mysqld. If no numeric dump file is named on the command
       line, the stack trace is read from the standard input.
       resolve_stack_dump supports the following options.
       路   --help, -h
           Display a help message and exit.
